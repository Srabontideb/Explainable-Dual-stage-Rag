my of will be home next month on april 30 ... my menstrual period is regular and i was just done a week ago ... in planning to take althea pill in his coming for protection .. when will be the right time to take the pill ? its okay if will stop after his leaving on 2nd week of may ? looking forward for or replies .. thanks a lot !,1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"i , a think a am 5 weeks . a have been running a low grade fever for 5 days and overtime a urinate , there is light brown discharge with like very small grey and brown flakes of tissue in it . a called my doc but he said it would be too early to see anything now and to just go to the of if a started bleeding bright red and cramping . is this normal ?",1,16737,"hallow dear, brown vaginal bleeding is old bleeding which remains inside for few days and then comes out. when it is of substantial amount, we suspect risk to the life of the baby. however, the bleeding was trivial and after such bleeding, you have been examined in the hospital and sent home with assurance. so no need to worry about the baby. it is likely that the mouth of the uterus (cervix) has started preparing for the delivery by getting gradually merged into the uterine walls. this process known as effacement of the cervix causes dislodgement of the mucous plug in the cervical canal with some bleeding. when such blood stained mucous come out immediately, it is red, however if it remains inside the vagina (due to very little amount or position) or cervix, the blood and thus the discharge becomes brown. however, 36 weeks is too early for starting labor process. so i would advise you to have complete rest in the house in a view to postpone the starting of labor pains as far as possible, at least for one week more. it would be good practice to monitor the well-being of the baby by listening to heart sounds (if you can do that) and/or counting the movements of the baby by clock. in left side position lying, in two hours, 10 movements are perceivable. if you note fetal movements getting affected, please report to the obstetrician asap. i hope this helps you."

"by son is 35 years old and within the last few days has experienced enlarged festivals approx 4-5 times what it should be . is urine is clear , however he has blood in his sperm . that are the reasons that this could be happening and what should be done about it .",1,831,"hi, thanks for writing in. it appears that your son has a melanoma that might have spread to neck lymph nodes. this is a possibility and has to be confirmed by doing a biopsy. what happens is that lymph nodes are found in many regions of the body and are small unless they are stimulated by disease process. when there is a disease in a person then the lymph nodes of a particular region get enlarged and this is a reaction by the immune mechanism. since your son has been told that he has a melanoma, it has probably involved the neck lymph nodes. the lymph nodes in the neck are close to the carotid artery and internal jugular vein, and it is possible that the lymph nodes have wrapped around these. doing a surgery in this condition is not possible and radiation usually works. it is suggested that you spend some time with your son by going over to his place and know more about the treatment he should be taking for his condition. please do not worry."

hi .... my dad have inflammation on his gums due to his new dentures so what a the cause and whats the cure ? male .. 63 years old complain from inflammation on his gums due to the new dentures ... what a the cause ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?,1,38096,"helloinflammation in gums due to new dentures is quite commonly seen possible cause inculde1.ill-fitting denture i.e. the denture is too tight or too loose2.also it is seen that placement of new denture in mouth causes hyper or hypo salivation. the later may also lead to inflammation3.it is common that when a person gets his new denture, he tries to eat (in his excitement of having an entire set of denture) things that are too hard to chew so what i would suggest is that you pay a visit to your dentist who will make the necessary fitting if the denture is ill fitting besides i would also advise your father to do the following things1.luke warm saline rinses for 4-6 times daily so that the blood circulation in the ridges is maintained good2.since denture puts a pressure on the residual ridge, so he should remove denture and let the tissues rest for sometime after every 3-4 hours3.he can also use gum astringent after every rinse (which is to be done after removal of denture).take a chat doctor. he should not go to sleep wearing the denture. the tissues also need rest5.he should try soft diet initially for a few days and then switch slowly to normal diet6.also sometimes it is seen that the denture is not properly cleaned before wearing, so what i would suggest is that he should clean the denture in running water with fingers before he wears them and when he removes the denture he should place the denture in clean water7.for the time being he can take paracetamol or combiflame twice daily for 2-3 days to reduce the inflammation hope that helps best of luck"

"a recently got all four wisdom teeth pulled back in december . yesterday a decided to eat popcorn and thought that a kernel may have gotten stuck so i tried flossing , brushing , using a oral pick , etc to try and get the `` kernel '' out , but nothing ever came out . a noticed that a still had some swelling and that my mouth was very tender . the swelling kept getting worse so i decided to rinse my mouth out again and noticed a black spot where my stitches were so a poked at it with a oral pick . once i did this pus started to gush out from the spot . that does this mean , and why did this happen ?",1,51344,"hello, youmay experience some sensitivity that would be considered normal. it should be with the teeth that had the new fillings and taking pain medication such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen should make you feel better. if you were told that a filling was particularly deep the sensitivity may linger especially to cold temperature. try toothpaste for sensitive teeth and fluoride rinses for some relief to sensitivity. if your gums are sensitive and irritated from the recent dental treatment, rinse with warm salt water and use gentle techniques with brushing and flossing. there are conditions that will require you to return to the dentist for an evaluation. does your body feel different from before you had the fillings done? you may need an adjustment to your bite. this means you have a high spot. reducing a small amount of the new filling may relieve your symptoms. i suspect this may be your condition when you have an overall feeling of sensitivity, mainly cold sensitivity, and had more than one filling done recently, is your pain increasing with hot sensitivity and pressure sensitivity accompanying your discomfort? this raises the concern of an infection. a very deep filling can be too close to the nerve which allows bacteria to enter causing infection. the tooth would require additional treatment such as a root canal. a less common situation would be an allergic reaction to the new materials in your mouth. monitor your symptoms and update your dentist. thank you for your inquiry. i hope my initial suggestions offer relief, and you feel much better within a week to two weeks. if your symptoms slowly improve take care with a softer diet and avoid extreme temperatures. continue to practice good oral hygiene and call your dentist for return visit if your condition does not improve shortly."

"hello , a recently had a semen analysis that had some abnormal results that lead the doctor to believe a would have difficulty impregnating my wife , however , a had smoked a small amount of marijuana about 36 hours before the test . would the results be different if a re-tested without marijuana use ? and how long should a wait ? thank you for your help !",1,13974,"hello! thank you for asking on chat doctor! your symptoms seem to be related to cardiac tachyarrhythmia, induced from marijuana. marijuana smoking can lead to marked increase in heart rate, lesser increases in supine blood pressure and frequent occurrence of postural hypotension. the latest would explain the feeling of fainting. on the one hand, these effects seem to be dose dependent, but on the other hand, the frequent use over a relatively short period of time results in tolerance. this means that after smoking regularly for some time, your body gets used to marijuana effects and you don't experience such symptoms when smoking marijuana anymore. but, i would recommend consulting with a gp for a careful physical examination, a resting ecg, a chest x-ray and some blood lab tests (complete blood count, thyroid hormone levels, blood electrolytes, fasting glucose, etc.), to rule out any possible underlying conditions. meanwhile, i would advise you to avoid smoking marijuana, because of these side effects on your cardio-vascular system and other side effects on different body organs. it can lead to tolerance (you need high doses to have the same effect) and addiction (you can't live without that). hope to have been helpful! best wishes,"

infertility believe that i may be infertile i had contracted chlamydia a year ago and didst know it i got it treated . my boyfriend and i have been having unprotected sex but we have a long distance relationship so its not all the time but we try around the time in ovulating could this just be from inconsistent sex ?,1,108892,"dear patient, from what i have read, i understand that you are going through a very difficult situation which needs to be handled with caution. you swear to god that you have not cheated on her, but she does not believe you. now, chlamydia is a bug that in many cases in male patients is associated with an asymptomatic infection. this means that you may have gotten the infection by a prior sexual relationship, 8 years ago, and the infection has been asleep and has not shown any symptom. this happens in about 80-90% of infected male patients. the other issue is the negativity of your wife toward the bug. if you have had the infection for so long, then she may think why hasn't she encountered the bug and gotten infected as well. i can only assume that the infection was so weak that it didn't show symptoms for 8 years, and it could not be spread to your wife. this is the only possible explanation, and this can happen. please try to calm your wife, and show your steadfast love and your desire to stay together. i hope my answer helps, manoku eni, m.d."

"i , my name is jacqueline . a had a slip 2 days ago and hit my back on a corner shelf pretty hard . it still hurts really bad when i move and pressure is applied in the area . there is no visible bruising , but should i see a doctor or give it some time ?",2,73387,"hi there! my name is vinay. let me see if i can give you some peace of mind here. mris all depend on magnets! no radiation and they are pretty harmless. the only thing you have to make sure is that you have no implants that could be attracted by the magnet in the machine. when i was in residency in colorado, the duty doc room used to be taken up by my chief and his girlfriend. so i used to sleep in the mri machine!! it was the only flat surface other than the gurneys in the er. so don't worry, the mri is harmless. now the scar tissue at the operative site should not be causing any headaches as its not under pressure and brain tissue can't feel normal sensations like pain. if you are having headaches. look into any problems with the scalp wound or the bone (skull) that they had to go through during the surgery. scar tissue can hypertrophy (grow in size) over time, but its really rare and really, really slow. so the mris will catch it if it does. not to worry there. so relax, the scar tissue is harmless and so is the mri. make sure you get those scans done just as the doctors tell you too! congratulations on beating back the gbm! i wish you the best of luck!"

(hide scan) is a nuclear imaging procedure to evaluate the health and function of the gallbladder. a radioactive tracer, usually technetium-99 m, is injected through any accessible vein, then allowed to circulate to the liver, where it is excreted into the biliary system and stored by the gallbladder and biliary system. in the absence of disease, the gallbladder is visualized within 1 hour of the injection of the radioactive tracer. if the gallbladder is not visualized within 4 hours after the injection, this indicates either cholecystitis or cystic duct obstruction. so it depends on the time at which image is taken. diagnosis also varies according to the variation in image n the time of taking an image after injection of radiotracer. so your radiologist who did the procedure n saw the images of hide scan can answer your question better. i hope this will be helpful to you."

a was doing the splits on top of my friends couches that are across from eachother about 4 feet apart and my right leg cracked 3 times right below my right buttcheek . sharp pain and numbness now going down my right leg . did a pull something or could it be serious ?,1,18289,"hello have gone through your question and understood your concern. pain in the legs can occur as a result of conditions that affect bones, joints, muscles, tendons, ligaments, blood vessels, nerves, or skin. leg pain can occur at night, while lying down, or while running or exercising, depending upon the cause(an in jury or a chronic disease.) since the leg contains a number of different structures and tissue types, a wide variety of conditions and injuries can cause leg pain. in your fathers case, in my opinion the cause can be diabetic neuropathy (nerve damage from diabetes). this is a common cause of leg pain in diabetics. anyway my recommendation for you is to consult his doctor because for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, it is important to differentiate the exact type and location of his pain in the leg. apart diabetes other potential causes of leg pain are:peripheral artery disease, blood clots (deep vein thrombosis), arthritis conditions, the pain of sciatica (from disc disease of the spine). all these alternatives should be taken in consideration for the right diagnosis and only after the right diagnosis your father can have the right treatment. hope this is helpful. thanks for using chat doctor for your health queries. wish you all the best."

"good afternoon , pm worried about my son of 10yrs old . over the past 2months he has woken in the morning with a nose bleed and subsequently passed out . this morning he passed out again even though the nose bleed was hardly anything at all ( just a bit of blood on his hand ) . would it be that he is just squeamish about his own blood ? thanks",1,40412,"hello! the nose bleed (medically termed epistaxis)cannot happen because of pulmonary embolism per se. embolism means there is clotting of blood in that blood vessel. while what your parent had experienced is bleeding (opposite of clotting) since you have mentioned that he is on anticoagulant medications (blood thinners) it is possible that these chat doctor. also, it is possible that this nose bleed could have been initiated by some other cause and aggravated by the blood thinner medications. in that case the underlying cause (maybe hypertension or trauma to nose or anything else relevant)needs to be looked for and treated. while on the way to physician, to reduce the nose bleed, ask your father to pinch his nose for few seconds and lean forwards, application of ice packs can help to constrict the leaking blood vessels and reduce bleed. the doctor would do a nasal packing to control bleed. get his blood pressure checked and inr testing done (accordingly the dose of anticoagulant needs to be adjusted)"

"hello , a have just left my doctors office and he explained that i might have hepatitis and that i need a blood test and a ultrasound.i was a caregiver and have stuck myself over the years with the lances to test blood sugar of diabetics.my liver enzyme level is 150 is this really bad ? .",1,31121,"sgpt is an enzyme which increases due to involvement of liver. as you had hepatitis level of sgpt has gone up. at present your level is not that high and in my opinion it is a downhill phase where level of this enzyme is coming down to normal, and it will become normal after some time. so the level of this enzyme is dependent on the condition of liver and as you have been treated for hepatitis it s level is expected to become normal in few days. there is nothing much that can we do to reduce it fast to bring it to normal. in my opinion you should not be concerned for level of this enzyme and enjoy your healthy state."

how i feel the gap in my front teeth ? i am 19year girl actually i have an accident case it happen when i am 18year so give me the suggestion which is the best option for filling the gap in my front teeth in minimum cost benz i am belonging to the middle class family see,1,78786,"the best ""non-invasive"" procedure is to get braces. unfortunately the cost involved and timespan of this treatment makes it unpopular with many patients. your next option is to get veneers for both teeth adjacent to the gap. this can only be done with a fairly small gap, which sounds about right in your case. if the gap is too wide, the veneers will leave you with short fat looking teeth. depending on existing fillings on teeth etc., your dentist might choose to make full crowns instead of veneers. from a cost point of view 1) veneers 2) crowns 3) bracero a non-invasive point of view 1) braces 2) veneers 3) crowns lastly, if the aesthetics of the small gap does not bother you, there is no dental reason to close the gap. if it is purely aesthetics, but, rather have the gap fixed with one of the above-mentioned treatments than allowing tartar to build up and ""fill"" the gap again. this will lead to soft tissue infection and bone loss around the teeth, which turns into a much bigger problem if left untreated."

a just got out of the hospital . a went in to the or for chest pains and pain in my left shoulder also shakiness like a jittery feeling . by or said a was fine after doing to egg a and also a stress test through in . a am still having pain in my arms and cramping in my chest . a am scared .,1,41649,"hello. thank you for your question and welcome to chat doctor. i understand your concern. well, i am going to try and explain the differences between various origins of the pain which can arise from the rib cage. there is angina. it is described more like mid-chest heaviness or squeezing sensation, that is triggered by exercise and relieved by rest, which radiates to the both sides of the chest, to the jaw and left arm and shoulder. it is indicative of a blockage within one or more coronary arteries and reflects the lowering of blood supply to the heart muscle. an ekg obtained in the moment of chest pain, if it fills this description, would be helpful. then there is pleuritic chest pain. this kind of pain is sharp, stabbing pain that can happen in any part of the chest area. no radiation like in anginal pain. it arises from acute or chronic inflammation of the linings that are within the rib cage: pleura (lining of the lungs) or pericardium (lining of the heart) or both. in this regard, i would recommend a chest x-ray for pleural inflammation or effusion. in case of pericardial pain and anginal pain, echocardiogram is helpful, by evaluating the size, motility and function of heart muscle and valves, and also by assessing the pericardium and whether there is fluid build-up within it, or not. other causes of chest pain are related to the locomotion system of the rib cage: muscle soreness, bone and cartilage-related pain. in the end, stress can also cause chest pain. i hope i was helpful with my answer. best regards,"

i have pain to the right of my belly button . it feels bruised on the inside . i also have pain a bit higher on my right side which sometimes moves straight through to my back . i have had gallbladder removed two years ago . the pain still exists and in fact it is worse .,1,77921,"most people who have gallstones do not have symptoms. if you have symptoms, you most likely will have mild pain in the pit of your stomach or in the upper right part of your belly. pain may spread to your right upper back or shoulder blade area. sometimes the pain is more severe. it may be steady, or it may come and go. or it may get worse when you eat. you may decide to go to the doctor because of pain in your belly. in this case, your doctor will ask you questions about when the pain started, where it is, and if it comes and goes or is always there. your doctor may order imaging tests. these take pictures of the inside of your body. an ultrasound of the belly is the best test to find gallstones. this test does not hurt. your ultrasound may not show gallstones. but if your doctor still thinks you have a problem with your gallbladder, he or she may order a gallbladder scan. in this test, a doctor injects dye into a vein in your arm. then a machine takes x-rays as the dye moves through your liver, bile duct, gallbladder, and intestine. if you do not have symptoms, you probably do not need treatment. if your first gallstone attack causes mild pain, your doctor may tell you to take pain medicine and wait to see if the pain goes away. you may never have another attack. waiting to see what happens usually will not cause problems. if you have a bad attack, or if you have a second attack, you may want to have your gallbladder removed. a second attack means you are more likely to have future attacks. many people have their gallbladders removed, and the surgery usually goes well. doctors most often use laparoscopic surgery. for this, your surgeon will make small cuts in your belly and remove your gallbladder. you will probably be able to go back to work or your normal routine in a week or two, but it may take longer for some people. sometimes the surgeon will have to make a larger cut to remove the gallbladder. it will take longer for you to recover from this type of surgery. regards and take care"

hi doctor my of and i had sex with a spermicide condom we checked by filling the condom with water another condom had a oil dot where the water was running out can i get pregnant ? i also want to say that in epileptic and i take trileptal 900 grams a day,1,74504,"hello! thanks for using chat doctor.come read carefully your question and understand your concern. i think you had allergic to the latex condom spermicide. perhaps you are allergic to the latex condom, one of the most common allergic reactions caused by sexual intercourse. although they say it affects only 1% of people, you can actually develop the allergy or sensitivity to the condom with the progressive contact with the latex or the material from which the condom is made - and / or the lubricants and spermicides it contains. generally, the symptoms of the allergy to the condom appear within a few minutes of penetration, but then they may get worse. in cases of irritation, hives and more severe dermatitis occur hours later. for example, the formation of blisters on the skin that has been in contact with the latex is common. i see similar cases amongst young people who visit my clinic. in the first meeting, i advise my patients to avoid using latex condoms to prevent these symptoms, but obviously always remembering the important premise of practicing safe sex. if you are sensitive or allergic to latex, you can resort to polyurethane condoms or animal skin condoms. polyurethane condoms work in the same way as latex condoms: they offer protection against pregnancy and prevent sexually transmitted diseases. animal skin condoms, however, do not provide protection against stds. while commonly allergic to condoms is not too serious, exposing yourself to such symptoms over and over again can be both annoying and harmful and can compromise not only your sex life but your overall health. and here the situation can be worse. so the best advice i can give you is to consult with your urologist properly diagnose your case, analyze what risks you have been exposed to in contact with latex condoms, and of course know what other contraceptive methods you can use that are harmless and comfortable. kind regards,"

i my mum has developed lumps in the lower part of the back . the is suffering a lot of pain and does to know what to do . the has had it a few times before but the pain always seems to go after a couple of days . however this time the pain does not seem to be easing and it has been persistent for around eight or nine days . have you got any idea of what this could be or what we should do ? thank you .,1,22667,"dear patient, i can understand your concern and feel sorry for the pain you are suffering from. you are informing me that when you got the upper molar extracted, the dentist told you that the bone between the sinus and tooth is destroyed and sinus cavity is open. roots of upper molar often are found inside the maxillary sinus, which causes opening of the sinus cavity while extraction of the tooth, creating an oro-antral fistula, that is a direct connection between oral cavity and sinus cavity. in this case, the food or water you take has chances of passing infection in the sinus through mouth and the infection does not resolve. it is mandatory to close this connection between mouth and the sinus. it could be done by the dentist by taking stitches in the area when he found that sinus has opened, but it can also be done now. however, as about 2 weeks has passed since extraction, the opening would not be as much clear as it would have been during extraction. a blood clot may have filled the area. so what you need to do now is, go to an oral surgeon or an ent specialist. i know you have insurance problem, but there seems no other solution to your problem. you might have to go for x-rays and probably ct scan of the area to diagnose if oro-antral fistula actually exists and if it does, you might have to go for a little surgery to close the communication between mouth and sinus followed by antibiotics to resolve the infection. i hope this information helps. thank you for choosing chat doctor. i wish you get well soon. best,"

a always feel tired and not fresh in the morning ? that is the solution ?,1,43564,hi there asd is basically a hole in the partition wall of upper two chambers of the heart called right and left atria. now right side of heart is a low pressure chamber and receives used blood from the body which lacks oxygen and left side is a high pressure side that pumps the fresh oxygen containing blood throughout the body. now when there is a hole in the partition used and fresh blood gets mixed up and body doesn't receive adequate fresh blood and person feels tired. after closure of the asd she will feel a lot better. in experienced hands as such there are no significant complications. she will be good don't worry. i wish her good luck
a always feel tired and not fresh in the morning ? that is the solution ?,2,30025,"hi, welcome to the chatdoctorbrief. romantic partial seizure (epilepsy) .is to be ruled out. detailed answer... there are some criteria which has to be differentiated between nightmare and romantic partial seizure .for example if child remembers in the morning that what he had seen in chat doctor. and if child does not remember, anything in the morning and seems to be tired and lethargic then it can be partial seizure type and has to be evaluated by eeg and discussing with neurologist further."
a always feel tired and not fresh in the morning ? that is the solution ?,3,29110,"there are two problems. there is the sensation of abnormal rhythm and the fact that it disturbs sleep. to catch a rhythm that is not daily, i usually recommend a long term monitor to try and catch the abnormal rhythm and tie it to the symptoms that you feel. for you, this may not be needed. abnormal sleep and abnormal rhythm often go together. if you are very tired in the morning, sleep easily during the day and snore loudly, you may have sleep apnea. sleep apnea is a common cause of abnormal heart rhythm requiring treatment. a sleep study or the simple recording of your heart rate and oxygen saturation overnight may answer both questions. discuss both options with your doctor to see which route will be most efficient."

"i after lunch a was watching a movie ( relaxed ) and my heart started to beat really fast and it felt like it was going to pop out of my chest , it does to happen often though . a thought a was having a many heart attack but a a only 16 and although it could happen to anyone i thought no way . a looked on the internet and it said something about a heart palpitations .",1,106734,"hello. thank you for your question and welcome to chat doctor. i carefully read your query. this extra heart beat, with the highest probability, is what we call extrasystole (a skipped heart beat). it is a premature heart beat that is generated from another area of the heart, not from the normal pacemaker of the heart. after this, there is a pause, as the heart ""resets"" and the next beat if more forceful and perceived from the individual experiencing it. this is called a palpitation. they can happen when you are tired, when you exerted vigorously, when you have had alcoholic beverages, and they can happen to anyone. in most of the cases, they are totally benign. however, it is not a good sign if they happen often. therefore, i would recommend you a 24-hour holder rhythm monitor, to check how many times these phenomena happen throughout a day, and if they exceed the ""normal"" limit, proper treatment should be started. my opinion is that you should not hold back from everyday activity. i hope i was helpful with my answer. wish you a good health. best regards,"

"hi , i just had a very unusual bizarre weird 6 month live in relationship with a 56 year old male . be has a brother diagnosed with schizophrenia , a nephew with asperger . on the first meet he wanted coffee at my place , i reluctantly said yes . whilst making coffee he slyly quietly came behind me unannounced and engaged in physical sex . that made me feel overwhelmed in shock in the safety of my own home . being adult to adult i didn't feel threatened , he acted ina quiet way . whilst living in my home i slowly noticed unusual signs and symptoms that i haven seen before in any other relationships . be was very routine oriented with waking at 5 am , shower 5.30 breakfast 5 45gym 6 am , ironing 7 am , bus to work 730 , home 5 30 pm , cooking together at 6pm eating 7pm whilst he slowly introduced alcohol into the equation with 4 beers and i bottle wine and with me sharing a glass two or three . be was asleep onbthe the couch by 730 awake 830 the to bed by 9pm withonly cuddles from behind , he would cover my face withe sheets . cuddles early morning before getting out bed . sex only from behind very rarely in middle of night . a constantly spoke of previous relationships in a criticising way except with bragging about fantastic sex with previous partner , he stated that didst work out as it was about sex and not real communication or interpersonal relations . stated this time bonding without sex may be longer lasting first , then the physical component next . he was reluctant to engage in going out to dinner , other social activities . over time , there was a bike ride once a fortnight only with his daughter , he was reluctant to do anything together just with the two of us except get a haircut or quickly in and out of the market for groceries for that nights meal . is left hand flapped about without me drawing attention to it as to reduce his possible embarrassment . be stated he has a high of , but reluctantly showed evidence of that . be stated he could easy mess with my mind and that i could easily be brainwashed . be was a gonna person.he didst contribute to utility costs and avoid transport costs.he preferred me to pick him up from work in my car using my petrol with a direct bus at the front of his work to drop off at home . i thought it was a romantic thing to do but got annoyed he took advantage of my mother type picking him up.he always go to me to pay for a bottle of wine and said pay you back later , never did , he used my face moisturizer , took care of his body well with good food and exercise at the gym . a a stated everyone

activities to include him indy home as he state he lost all he had in bad business deal . be went from woman to woman with his charismatic stoic use of few words monotone dialogue . if any interjection , he would say hear me out , so my input would be minimal and feedback would be non existence . be had unusual theories on aliens altering our dan which caused our imperfections and short life span . he also had a tic with flapping his nose . if he notice me noticing he would reduce that behaviour . he was clumsy footed and would trip over a small optical like a pair of shoes the way and reluctantly would walk down a small slope of dirt and stone ground , yet could easily ride his mountain bike down a much steeper slope . he can drive cars and motorbikes well and fast . appeared to have no fear with some things . he wouldn't go outside the dark to turn the hot water service back on and got quiet agitated with the hot water being off which altered his structure routine and aggressively demanded that i get a plumber to fix the hot water . he wouldn't have a shower at the gym of it wouldn't be hygienically clean enough so he went to his sex girlfriends place . this was followed within apology . he would walk in the dark for night walk , but eventually did with walking along the side that was well lit . he stated he hated his mother and father as he stated he was abuse as a child.in the early stage or first meet he drew attention to detail with noticing and my hands with a critical type comment . he made other criitisims to my physical appearance , the way i walked , the way i spoke , the way i kiss ( like a turtle ) . he said he wanted to find out what made me tic . he got agitated and aggressive when i asked him to turn the radiostationto quite relaxing music whilst trying to get to sleep . he suddenly jumped out of bed yelling he has no where to go and called me spinner . i refused to engage in dialogue and said in not talking in going sleep . this made him feel annoyed . he finally calmed down . this made me feel frightened . another time he was angry about catching the bus home as it was getting dark and he said there were no buses . i said i can pick him up froth bus stop he said hell catch a taxi , i said no just wait . he caught the bust then went to catch taxi to further the journey . i was in contact reassuring and trying to allay his fears and aggression . i continued to calmly measure him when i collected him in the car , he still continued his verbal diatribe . i suddenly had enough of his lack of gratitude that i came half an hour away in the dark wet rainy conditions through 2 traffic accidents , so i stomped the brakes and yelled get out . he would so i droveoff in a calm quiet but fast driving way that scared him . i calmly yet sternly assertively said i was a rally car driver and a police officer in my attempt of believable humour to alleviate my stress . finally things calmed down over a beer . he later used this and said i have anger management issues . very weekend he would revisit his sex girlfriend for a coffee , i was not invited . he said he was getting his mail and checking his things that he left there so he wouldn't have pay . then every 3 weekends he would disappear without telling and late rang or texted he was at mates . water i discovered the mate was a female , his response was that there was nothinghappening , that it was a safe house . he kept saying to me are you still for the journey , ready for the challenge , push the boundaries , up the anti . he did nice things for me ,

a cheap 50 dollar ring very nice , and it was the thought to me from a second hand store . then the next weekend he got sex drunk and abused me with words like go back to your husband , no one wants etc . then that weekend he took of to his safe house as my gut feeling new he was there , so i waited for him there and drove up behind him when he went into the other woman house and i jumped out and said over and put my hand up and then ran off the car . felt mortified my whole life experiences caving onto of me.what do think an how do you see this situation . is it a combination naricissm , asperger , liar , cheater , alcoholism , control and co dependency .",1,0,"hi, thank you for posting your query. the most likely cause for your symptoms is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (bppv), a type of peripheral vertigo. in this condition, the most common symptom is dizziness or giddiness, which is made worse with movements. accompanying nausea and vomiting are common. the condition is due to problem in the ear, and improves in a few days on own. betahistine tablets would help relieve your symptoms. doing vestibular rehabilitation or adaptation exercises would prevent the recurrence of these symptoms. an ent evaluation would also help. i hope it helps. best wishes, chat doctor."

allergic manifestation of skin, where an allergen leads to release of certain substances from your blood, leading to itchy skin rash and swelling over soft tissues. its proper management requires thorough history, clinical and laboratory work-up. you may have to go for specific tests like patch test, food prick test, ige antibody levels etc. as for treatment part, best would be the avoidance of allergen as far as possible. try to eliminate possible triggering foods from diet. i would also advise you various antihistamines for long duration(at least 3 months) with or without oral corticosteroids. for non-responding cases there are many other chat doctor. hope this will help you in resolving your query. thank you"

of i know you are probably going to think i am crazy but this is what i did ..... i had my tooth on the top beside the big tooth brake off and it hurt really bad and i did/do not have money to go to the dentist so i thought i would try to pull it my self cut there was not much tooth left . well i was wrong and i end up ripping my gum off so lot of the gum is gone cut on the roof of my mouth and it hurts really really bad ! the tooth is sill there and the gum is white and and there are a few places above the white that are bright red and the hole area is swollen around the tooth and couple of teeth over ! is there anything i can do for the pain ? will my gum ever heal from wear i tried to pull the tooth ? thank you for the help,1,53390,hi. can understand your concern. as per your complaint the swollen gum and the white material inside it is a result of some inflammation. there can be a few reasons depending upon whether it is the second molar or the wisdom tooth. in case it is a wisdom tooth which is erupting or is impacted then the gum above it can get infected and inflamed due to either food deposition between the gum and the wisdom tooth or it can be due to gum flap bitten by the opposite jaw tooth and the condition is known as peritonitis. the white material in it is pus. in case it is second molar the swollen gum with white material in it can be as a result of infection in the gums due to deposits on the teeth like plaque or calculus or due to foreign body impaction in the gums which carries infection along with it deeper into the gums causing pus formation. it can also be due to deeply infected tooth causing pus formation below the tips of the roots of the tooth causing swelling on the gums with pus inside. i would suggest you to consult a dentist and get evaluated for the exact cause of the swelling and get treated accordingly. in case if it is wisdom tooth either excision of gum flap or extraction if the tooth is impacted followed by antibiotics and painkillers can be done. in case of gum infection professional cleaning of teeth followed by antibiotics and gum paints can help. in case of tooth infection root canal treatment or extraction depending on the condition of the tooth can be done. hope your query is solved. if you find the answer helpful please write a positive review and click on find this answer helpful as a token of appreciation. thanks and regards. chat doctor.

"i , a am a female 17 years old . a have pain in my chest and by my ribs . when getting dressed a notices my nipples were purple but would go back to normal . it has been doing this randomly today . note : a am not sexually active but on the birth control pill . ave been on the pill for almost a year and this is the first time it has happened . that should i do ?",1,77098,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. many women who have been on birth control for many years can develop a tolerance of sorts for the pills' ability to control your menstrual cycle, especially after they have not menstruated for a long time due to pregnancy or another cause. this can also occur to the fact that you did relatively recently give birth, especially if you were breastfeeding. bleeding when you are not supposed to have your period on the pill is called breakthrough bleeding. it does not mean the pill is ineffective as a contraceptive, but having some irregular bleeding in between periods or a different bleeding pattern that you may have had before the pregnancy is not unusual. having heavy bleeding in the morning is likely due to the blood accumulating in your vagina during the night, and then it all comes out at once when you get out of bed due to gravity. your cycle may get back to normal after a few more months on the pill, and taking it as close to the same time every day will help to reduce the risk of breakthrough bleeding. if it continues for more than 3 months, you may benefit from changing your birth control brand to one with a slightly higher dose of estrogen, as the estrogen in the pill is the ingredient that controls your menstrual cycle. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"a have been experiencing lower back and hip pain when a try to sleep . a also have been experiencing nerve pain down the front of my thigh . occasionally if a have been sitting for a long time a will feel the pain during the day , but it primarily happens when a lay down . is this sciatica ? that could be the cause ? thanks .",1,72146,"hello and welcome, thanks for your query. when you say your pain is usually at night, is it because you sleep on your back and thus apply pressure on your lower back and/or left leg (mainly till your mid-thigh) ? does the pain start from her lower back and go down till mid-thigh? if yes, this could most probably be her sciatic nerve being irritated and is also called sciatica. let me list few of the most common causes of sciatica: -degenerative disc disease: the discs in every human being undergo a degenerative process with age, and is considered to be normal. when these discs undergo degeneration they tend to irritate the nerve root present in the lower back, which can result in sciatica. -sacroiliac join dysfunction: the lowest end of your spine consists of fused bones called the sacrum. this bone articulates with the iliad bone (one of the three bones forming your pelvis), thus this joint is called the sacroiliac joint. any irritation of this joint can also cause the same pain that would be typical for sciatica. -performs syn chat doctor. the sciatic nerve passes under this muscle, and any irritation of this muscle can also lead the sciatica. -herniated disc: the lumbar part of your disc can develop a hernia which is when the inner core of the disc leaks out or herniates. this protrusion can irritate the nerve roots, also resulting in sciatica. --islamic spondylolisthesis: in this condition a small fracture allows one vertebral body to slip forward on another. due to this the sciatic nerve can get pinched and cause the pain. -lumbar spinal stenosis: stenosis (narrowing) of the spinal canal can cause the sciatic nerve to get pinched and cause this pain other causes can be: muscle strain, spinal tumors, pregnancy, scar tissue, infection, direct injury, etc. please consult your doctor on the same and try to find the cause in order to properly manage the sciatica as different cause require different management techniques. i hope i have succeeded in answering your questions, you could write back to us anytime for further clarifications. best wishes."

"of doc , since i was younger i always have irregular periods . a be been taking birth control pills ( allesse 28 ) for more than 3 years . by husband and i are ready to have kids so i stopped taking my pills 3 months ago and got regular monthly period for 3 months . but this november i should be getting my period on november 26 ( i got my last period last october 26 ) but until now i did to get it yet . a did check it using home pregnancy test 3 a now in different days but it still show negative . pm i pregnant but too early to check or did my irregular period came back ? thank you",1,106922,"hallow dear, your menstrual cycle though not very regular, is varying between 26 and 29 days; i should say fairly regular. in regular menstrual cycle, the egg is released 14 days prior to the next expected menses. the egg has a life of 24 hours while sperms are active for 72 hours. hence, a period of about a week around the day of egg release is fertile period. considering your period of about 28 days, your expected period was around 14 november and the day of egg release (ovulation) would be around 31 october. this calculates fertile period from 27 october to 4 november. thus, your unprotected intercourse on 10 november falls way outside the fertile period. thus, according to this calculation, you carry very minimal risk of pregnancy due to this intercourse. however, we have to consider your age factor. your age is 47 years; nearing menopause. variation in your menstrual pattern is due to the premenopausal changes. during this period of life, the ovulation is very unpredictable and irregular. not all the cycles are ovulatory. moreover, the menses also may become irregular. thus, it really becomes difficult to calculate the safe period. even if your menses are delayed, you cannot figure out whether these are premenopausal irregularities or possibility of pregnancy. hence, during this phase of life, it is always advisable to use reliable contraceptive like condom. i feel, with this menstrual history and history of intercourse, you stand very minimal, almost no chance of pregnancy. you should get your menses. however, if at all you do not get menses even 40 days after the last menstrual period; i.e. 26 november, perform pregnancy test on overnight first morning urine sample. i hope this helps you."

a have had three surgeries on the left side of my neck for papillary thyroid cancer and three radioactive pills taken afterwards . it my last visit it shows that the cancer is still there . that does this entail . get another surgery . by doctor said a would not be able to get any more radioactive pill treatments . now about the possibility of using the cyberknife to get all of the microscopic cells out that keep growing back .,1,80145,"hello, tg or thyreoglubuline is a glycoprotein, so a protein, produced in your thyroid gland. so when your thyroid gland is completely removed (total thyroidectomy) or destroyed by radioactive sodium, the tg level should in theory be zero as there is no thyroid tissue level left. in cases of some thyroid cancer like papillary cancer the tg level is a parameter to follow up the disease. so if the tg level is increasing, that might be a sign that the cancer has come back. so after removing the lymph nodes it's a good sign that the level of tg is going down, but i agree that the level is still too high. so it's not a question of suppressing, it's rather a question of follow up of your cancer. the difficult part is when levels are still high and there's nothing to see on the ultrasound, where are there still cancer cells? so a ct scan of the neck and chest might give information as well as a nuclear scan. hope this answered your question"

"when a go out to dinner sometimes a feel really sick and a have even passed out before in the middle of restaurants . a was wondering if this could be because a done eat enough food throughout the day and somehow eating a meal lateran cause my blood pressure to drop ? of so , is this something to worry about ?",1,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

now likely is it to become pregnant when having unprotected sexual intercourse on the first day of a menstrual cycle ? is it a sign when the menstrual cycle ( unlike being the usual 3-4 days time period ) to only last one day and the bleeding stops completely the next day after intercourse and have no cramps ?,3,95735,"hallow dear, at the time of ovulation, little spotting for few hours is known. it is called as mittelschmerz. this is very little spotting for few hours. so after the spotting is over, there is no harm in having intercourse. bleeding on day 6 of the cycle cannot be mittelschmerz. it is just an extended menstrual bleeding. during menstrual bleeding, intercourse carries risk of infection since blood is a very good medium for the growth of pathogens. on this day intercourse is futile also since there is no egg present on this day. the fertile period is not around day 6 of the cycle. the egg is released 14 days prior to the next expected menses. the egg has life of 24 hours and the sperms are active for 72 hours. hence, a period of about a week around the day of egg release (ovulation) is considered as fertile period. those who are keen to have pregnancy should concentrate on this period for sexual relations. you are following further with bbt also to identify the day of ovulation. now you have more accurate methods available for locating the day of ovulation. ovulation kits available in the market are good for practical purpose. ultrasonography ovulation monitoring is a very good method. from day 9 of the cycle, daily ultrasonography informs about the development of follicle & endometrium and the event of egg release also. follicles which ovulate when they are between 18 mm to 21 mm size have best results of conception and continuation of pregnancy. for successful implantation of fertilized ovum, endometrium of 10 mm or more thickness is lucrative. considering the life of egg and sperms, you can definitely avoid the intercourse during mittelschmerz since it is a short phase of the day; and still have successful intercourse during or around the ovulation. i hope this helps you."

erceflora would take effect for how many days,1,99139,"hello dear.... thanks for your query. well first i must mention that there might be many reasons for such eruptions. so a proper history and follow up is needed. where did the spots develop? how they appear as? are they just spots, nodules or pustules? is there any pain associated? keep informing here how the condition progresses. one of the possible cause might be bite by parasitic insect timex lectularius commonly known as bed bug. when bed bugs bite, they inject an anesthetic and an anticoagulant that prevents a person from realizing they are being bitten. most people do not realize they have been bitten until bite marks appear anywhere from one to several days and sometimes even up to 14 days after the initial bite. now for relief from the itch take levocetrizine 5 mg tablets thrice daily for 5 days [it may make u feel a bit sleepy which is side effect of levocetrizine, but don't worry]keep your skin clean and don't stretch the red spots as it may cause secondary infection. it would be better to consult a dermatologist. take care and keep informing here how it progresses...."
