"hello sir , a have a issue with my skin .. by skin is getting tan and even getting minute black scars .. a done expose much to sun nor travel on two wheeler to be effected .. but i can feel my skin is getting really dark . please suggest me some lotion or fairness cream to eradicate the problem .. thanking you , raghava .",1,78259,"hello rama, welcome to chat doctor forum. it is very common to get pimples (acne)at this age due to the hormonal changes taking place in your body with puberty. they do subside as age advances.however, it is advisable to get it treated if you are getting pustules or nodular acne which leave behind hyperpigmented scars on the face causing the face to appear dark. so a consultation with a dermatologist would be beneficial if you really suffer from bad acne scars.meanwhile, here are some tips to help prevent breakouts and clear them up as fast as possible: 1. wash your face twice a day with warm water and a mild soap. gently massage your face. don't scrub. overwashing and scrubbing can cause skin to become irritated. 2.don't pop pimples. its tempting, but you shouldn't: popping pimples can push infected material further into the skin, leading to more swelling and redness, and even scarring. 3. avoid touching your face with your fingers or leaning your face on objects that collect sebum and skin residue like your phone. touching your face can spread the bacteria that cause pores to become inflamed and irritated. to keep bacteria at bay, wash your hands before applying anything to your face, such as treatment creams or makeup.4. keep hair clean and out of your face to prevent additional dirt and oil from clogging your pores.5. protect your skin from the sun. it may seem like a tan masks acne, but its only temporary. a tan may worsen your acne, not improve it. tanning also causes damage to skin .6. avoid over the counter acne creams as each skin type is different and creams prescribed by doctor after examining your skin are preferable. you may apply natural aloe vera gel for better results. regards"

ave recently started taking admin birth control and first of all ave had my period for the whole month and 2 days ago i started drinking the white pills from the pack so in assuming that that is when my period starts . secondly my breast have become a bit bigger and they are a bit tender . is all this normal ? ? ?,1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"quick question . if anyone can provide me with an answer , it would be much appreciated . my of is freaking out like you wouldn't believe . last night we had sex , the condom he was using broke . in already 5 days late for my period . i figured it was just stress .. about an hour ago i started .. i know the sperm can live in the uterus for a few days .. and i was just wondering if anyone knows if i can get pregnant ?",1,83091,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. having your period come late or skip occasionally is common in many women, even when they are not pregnant. most of the time, a delayed period can just be a chance event, but it also can because by stress, changing time zones or traveling, recent weight gain or weight loss. if that is the case, you will usually get it somewhere between 2 and 4 weeks late. a fall usually will not affect your menstrual cycle, unless the stress of your injury was a factor. either way, there is nothing dangerous about missing your period once in a while. if you miss your period for more than 3 months, you should see a gynecologist, so you can be evaluated for hormone imbalanced and the doctor can prescribe appropriate medication to help your period to come. if you are at risk for pregnancy (meaning if you had unprotected sex in the last three weeks), you should repeat the pregnancy test in a week or so just in case. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

(regular use of emergency pill is harmful)conception occurs if she was in 10th to 18th day of her cycle(in a regular cycle of 28 day duration). you can ask her at what day she is in and wait for next cycle to occur. if it delayed by 7 days then get done upt to diagnose if pregnant and then the required treatment can be taken. regards"

hello . a am currently on nearing birth control and mistakenly took it out a week early the . by regular schedule.once a realized a was early in removing the ring a put it back in with in a 24 or period but beyond the 3 hour limit . a did have unprotected sex during the time of when the sugaring was removed . to a need to take emergency contraception pill or let the nearing release the hormones during 7 days to regulate my hormones again ?,1,8772,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the proper way to use the nearing is to put it in, leave it in for 3 weeks, take it out, wait one week, and replace it. during the week you are not wearing the ring, you should have some bleeding that is considered a menstrual cycle. if you wore the ring continuously for two months and then had a new one replaced but only removed it 3 days later, the pinkish spotting was your ""period"", which is caused by not wearing the ring. the bleeding was very light because you had suppressed it by continuously wearing the ring for over 2 months. so you should expect your next period about 4-5 weeks after the episode of spotting that you had. if you do not have menses by then, i recommend repeating the pregnancy test at that time. if you did not have regular monthly cycles before you used the ring, your cycle will follow your regular pattern that you typically have when not using hormonal contraception. if you are trying to get pregnant, you should have intercourse about every other day and begin taking prenatal vitamins as it benefits the health of the baby for the vitamins to be present at conception. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

a got a vasectomy 4 years ago and since then a have had epidymitis 3 times and now pm at # 4 . by doctor has asked about my sexual partners but have had none but my wife . to he believes shes cheating . be doesn't believe the vasectomy he performed is doing it . a have not been tested for std any of these times . by wife is very angry with me for asking . are there any other ways a can have this recur ? its been about once per year .,1,108892,"dear patient, from what i have read, i understand that you are going through a very difficult situation which needs to be handled with caution. you swear to god that you have not cheated on her, but she does not believe you. now, chlamydia is a bug that in many cases in male patients is associated with an asymptomatic infection. this means that you may have gotten the infection by a prior sexual relationship, 8 years ago, and the infection has been asleep and has not shown any symptom. this happens in about 80-90% of infected male patients. the other issue is the negativity of your wife toward the bug. if you have had the infection for so long, then she may think why hasn't she encountered the bug and gotten infected as well. i can only assume that the infection was so weak that it didn't show symptoms for 8 years, and it could not be spread to your wife. this is the only possible explanation, and this can happen. please try to calm your wife, and show your steadfast love and your desire to stay together. i hope my answer helps, manoku eni, m.d."

"by husband and a are trying to have a baby for 4 months now . be do everything , like lifting legs up and having sex every other day , why doesn't it seem to work ? a know there is about a 25 % each month of me getting pregnant . that can we do that this month , a can get pregnant ?",1,19436,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. any woman having unprotected sex is at risk for pregnancy, so it certainly is possible that you may have conceived your first month. however, 80 percent of couples will conceive within one year, so if you divide that by 12 (for each month) you have about a 6 percent chance of conceiving per cycle. sperm live in the female genital tract for up to 72 hours, so it is generally recommended when trying to get pregnant to have sex every other day between the time your period finishes and the time you feel pms symptoms (which means you have already ovulated and can no longer conceive that cycle). so i would try to be patient and understand that it sometimes can take some time to become pregnant. in the meantime, i recommend you try to eat a healthy diet, get plenty of rest, avoid alcohol and smoking and begin to take folic acid, which is a b vitamin that has been shown to help prevent birth defects. 400 micrograms daily is the standard dose, which can be purchased alone or in prenatal vitamin preparations. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and i wish you the best of luck getting pregnant! best wishes,"

(many couples seek help at six to nine months, though, which is fine if you're getting anxious about your failure to conceive.) having sex every day does not decrease your chances of getting pregnant. i hope that helps, and good luck!"

"hello doc . by mother has degenerative disc disease which has caused me to look more into my own symptoms . by lower back is sore many nights , usually needing a rub to soon the sharp pain .... when a walk or move or sit - i feel as if my lower back is popping or the discs are rubbing - it sounds and feels like when you pop you knuckles . it does not come with severe pain but the sound is concerning and a am now more concerned with my mothers recent update on her health .",1,13930,"hello, and thank you for your question. fortunately, you probably do not have fibromyalgia. there are several possible causes of pain just in the toe. if there is a pinched nerve in the lower spine, it can cause pain that can be just in one toe. if this is the case, you may find that the pain is worse with change in position, such as lying flat or standing up. pain in the toe, typically the big toe, is common in a disorder called gout, in which the body has too much uric acid. the pain usually lasts a few days at a time, and is usually associated with redness and swelling. pain in the toes can be caused by corns or other skin problems that look small but feel very severe. pins and needles, shooting, on-and-off pains can be caused by irritation to a nerve by diabetes, by lack of vitamins such as b12, or by pressure - similar to the ""foot falling asleep"" feeling we sometimes get if we cross our legs too long. fibromyalgia, on the other hand, is usually a ""pain all over"" problem - back pain, neck pain, arm pain, knee pain, without another cause such as arthritis. it usually does not cause just one part of the body to hurt - most patients say that ""everything hurts"". in my practice, i start with finding out as much as i can from the patient about how the pain feels and how long it has been going on, and if it seems related to anything else. then we examine the foot to look for anything going on with the skin, check if the nerves of the foot are normally sensitive, not as sensitive as usual, or more sensitive, and then we may check blood tests to detect diabetes or vitamin deficiency or other problems as needed. fibromyalgia is diagnosed by obtaining a careful history of where the patient is having pain, other medical problems, and completing a physical exam including what is called a ""painful point"" exam where the doctor pushes at certain places in the body - on the back and near the joints - to see if this causes pain. i hope that my answer to your question is helpful. if you have any further questions, please check back with us. i hope your toe is much better soon."

a have had what looks like a leg ulcer for almost 4 months . by doctor took swabs and told me i had peptostreptococcus . which is an unusual bug in someone who has not had surgery . therefore they think i must have contracted this from a insect bite . a have had a course of penicillin and a course of metronidonzle which didst help . a now have a combination of both together which again does not seem to be helping . can you tell me a bit more about peptostreptococcus ?,1,81160,"hello, it seems from your message that your father has had a stroke. therefore, there may have been the need for action chat doctor. however, this medicine can cause bleeding and so inr needs to be maintained. there are 2 possibilities in view of the difficulty in speaking:1. he has had a minor stroke again-this is usually quite common in stroke patients (the development of the 2nd stroke).2. there is edema developing in the brain that is leading to the recurrence of the symptoms. there remains a possibility, however this i have not considered chiefly because you have not mentioned any suggestive symptoms, that he may have a metabolic/infectious cause going on which may be leading to the recurrence of the symptom. having said all that, i don't think it is related directly to the dose of action- if the doctor had increased the dose, i would have considered a risk for hemorrhage. but in this situation, it does not seem to be likely. i would suggest admission, and testing with a repeat scan and blood tests. continued speech therapy may help him. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

be consulted a sync yesterday ... she told that the egg has got released from the ovary of my wife ... the suggested us to have intercourse as the egg would be alive for about 48 hours ... i wanted to know what are the chances of my wife becoming pregnant ? ?,1,31972,"hallow dear, there is a lot of misconception. firstly, if you had menses from 10th to 15th, 18th is the day 8 of your cycle. the fertile window usually lies between day 10 to day 20 of the cycle (see below). so the chances of becoming pregnant are very remote. moreover, it is impossible for the nurse to diagnose a pregnancy on day 10 of the cycle after menses. the egg is yet to be released. the egg is released (ovulation) 14 days before the next expected menses. egg lives for 24 hours and sperms are active for 72 hours. hence, a period of about 8 to 10 days around this day of ovulation is considered as fertile window. so on 20th your ovulation also had not taken place. how can you become pregnant? no test for pregnancy will reveal pregnancy as it is not there. please wait for the menses. if you have few more intercourse in the fertile window, you will have chances to conceive and then 8-10 days after the missed period, your urine test for pregnancy will detect it. of course, beta chat doctor tests can give reliable results within 2-3 days of missed period. best wishes,"

pregnancy ? ? hello pm 18 not on birth control always have had a regular period its always on time never really had a problem . last month my of came in me four days before ovulation my period was then two days late and when it started it was somewhat heavy for two days then stopped i have had some symptoms but not many i took one test it was negative haven taken another since . just in case ave started on prenatal vitamins if you could help me it would help me soon much thank you for taking the time to read,1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"hello sir , me and my family is very much disturb with my father .. begun he always want to kill my mon .. and he beat her and thought that she having did his brother , father in low infant did her son so plus help me .. wat i have to do .. and is he will be fine or not",1,5481,"hi there, im sorry to hear about the medical problems your father is having. when i hear the symptoms that your father is having, the first thing that comes to my mind is claudication. claudication is pain while walking due to arterial insufficiency- basically, the muscles in the legs don't get enough blood flow when they are being used, and they start to ache. this is caused by peripheral vascular disease and is common in smokers, diabetics, and patients with high cholesterol levels. these patients will often have a history of coronary artery disease and sometimes renal problems as well. the first thing i would recommend is for your father to start a waking regiment and walk consistently every day. he should aim to walk for about 30 minutes a day. if he cants do 30 minutes, he should do as much as he can, and then try to do a little more each day. the most important thing is daily consistency - he has to do it every day, not just one or two times a week. i'd also recommend he check his cholesterol levels, and if they are high a statin such as lipitor (atorvastatin) can help lower his levels and prevent further damage. finally, if he continues to have problems with walking after 6 months of a dedicated walking problem, then he should see a vascular surgeon and have his arterial vessels looked at in his leg with ultrasound. i hope this is helpful. please contact me with any questions."

a have a very painful access or canker sore on the inner side of my upper gum . its been swollen and bloody for days . the bone underneath protrudes there due to having removable braces during my youth which rubbed the gum so the bone protrudes . because of this the sore is extra painful and uncomfortable . that should a do ?,1,42367,hi. thanks for the query. a painful swollen and bloody abscess seems to be most probably due to either deep infection in gum or it can be due to tooth decay if at all you have a decayed tooth in that area. the protruding bone seems to be due to bony torus formation that is an overgrowth of the jaw bone. if you have the abscess/ulcer over the mucosa that is present over the bony overgrowth then it can be probably a certain caused due to continuous trauma to the mucosa. so my suggestion is to get examined by a dentist. if needed x-rays will be taken for finding out the exact cause for the abscess as well as bony overgrowth. treatment will be dependent on the final diagnosis. for now gargle with antiseptic mouthwash and also do warm saline gargles. if it is painful then applying lidocaine gel can help. hope your query is resolved. regards.

of a have been on birth control for 2 and a half years now and accidentally skipped two pills consecutively during end of week 2/beginning of week three of my last pack and have unprotected sex at the end of week one of my new pack which would be the day before my `` ovulation day '' according to my cycle . should a be concerned ? also a take ampicillin for skin conditions and have been on it for 4 years now . does this also affect if a should be concerned ?,1,41273,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. if you already missed three pills in a row in this pack of pills, you already have been at risk for pregnancy since you may have ovulated this month. you can finish the pack you are taking, but i would use a backup method of birth control for the protection during the rest of the pack. after your placebo week finishes, if you are not pregnant, you should just start a new pack of pills on time and if you don't miss any, your contraceptive will be effective after the first week of the new pack. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"hi , i am a 28 yrs married lady.nov,09 i had a miscarriage , after that my period was very irregular.only i got period after taking duphaston and primolute a but december,10 i got my period naturally but wont stop naturally.after a heavy bleeding and clotting of continuous 30 days i took tragic of twice a day for 7 days.i want to know will it be back again after completing 7 days and i also want to conceive as soon as possible for that should i try now ?",1,10535,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. pregnacare conception is simply a combination of vitamins that help a woman have a healthy pregnancy from conception. it has no hormonal effects and should not have any impact on the regularity of your cycle nor your ability to conceive, it is not unusual for women to bleed on and off for even 6 weeks after a miscarriage so the 19-day bleeding episode you had may not have actually been a menstrual period but still could have been bleeding leftover for your d and c. so you may not be ""late"" at all, but may just have not had a real period since the pregnancy. there is no reason to assume you would have problems getting pregnant again since you have conceived naturally twice in the last year. either way, the pregnancies conception vitamins have nothing to do with your irregular bleeding. it is generally advisable to wait to try to conceive again after your first real period-so i would wait until you bleed again to resume trying to conceive. if you do not get a real period by 3 months from your last bleeding episode, you should follow up for your gun for a re-evaluation of your hormones and treatment with progesterone, which can restart your period cycling. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful. best wishes,"

"i doc ! in very irregular.my period comes twice a month since i become active in love making . by of prescribed me duphaston last april 6 and i had my period that same day.my period lasted til april 11.i finished my duphaston on 17th.on the 20th i start bleeding again and it lasts for 3 days.however , since april 22 , i did to have my period yet till now.i do home of last week but the result is negative . and i had brownish discharges this past week for about 5 days.doc , what do a think is wrong.could it be possible that a am pregnant ?",1,100885,"hallow madam, i hope i can be of help to you today. the due date of delivery (dd) is calculated by a formula dd= last menstrual period date (lmp) + 9 months + 7 days. since you had your lmp on 10 july 2010, the dd would be on 17 april 2011. if dd provided to you is by ultrasonography, a variation of one week is acceptable as ultrasonography calculated dd is by the size of the baby and is calculated from the date of conception. to calculate the date of egg release (ovulation), it happens 14 days before the next expected menses. so considering your menstrual cycle of 30 or 31 days, next menses would be on 10 august and ovulation would be on 28 july 2010. the life of an egg is 24 hours and the sperms are active for 72 hours. hence, a period of one week around the ovulation is fertile period. so your fertile period would be 24 july to 1 august. thus, the conception would be in that period. now in this calculation, you have to make some modifications depending on the periodicity of your menstrual cycle. then you can locate your fertile period of that cycle. thus, the intercourse(s) during this fertile period are likely to cause the pregnancy. if you had a solitary intercourse during fertile period, that day or within 4 days of that day would be the day of conception. of course this all is based on the clinical calculations. if you want to ascertain the paternity of your child for any legal cause, you may go for dna test which would be a foolproof evidence. i hope this helps you."

a have the gum infection and i have tried with several doctors to treatment but so far no results ..... they also removed several of my teeth and have few cracked teeth left and am unable to eat well . a am also feeling weak with reduced palpitations . and other complications coming up ..... i am travelling to bombay tomorrow . what should i do,1,42407,"thanks for your query, i have gone through your query. the gum infection can be treated with scaling and root planing, if needed bone grafting. the cracked teeth can be treated with either rct or extraction. before that we need to find out the cause for the gum infection and cracked teeth. if the gum infection and loose teeth is because of the deposits then the scaling and root planing will work. if the cracked teeth are secondary to grinding your teeth during nighttime(bruise), then you need to get a soft splint to prevent damage to the bone and teeth. for this you need to consult an oral physician and get it evaluated. i hope my answer will help you, take care."

( i have taken the tablets quite frequently over the years )",2,33341,"hi, if you came to my clinic with those complaints i would ask you to stop worrying. many women that start using the pills for the first time experience similar problems. i understand that you have taken the inactive pills first and then started on the active pills. also, you have had intercourse only after your period was over that is about 11 days ago. the chances of pregnancy occurring after a single act of unprotected sexual intercourse are only 4%. also, for women that have regular periods the chance of getting pregnant is more if intercourse occurs after 11-12 days since the first day of the period. hence, the chances of getting pregnant are low if you have had contact before this period. you are also having a sick feeling in the stomach and most probably a cramp like feeling. this may be due to the pills as some females take time to get adjusted and may improve with continuous use and by taking the pills with food. the pills are not known to cause any major effect on the baby if they are inadvertently taken in early pregnancy. since you have started taking the active pills late, i would recommend that you use a backup contraceptive measure like condoms, for the next 7 days while you still take the pills to avoid pregnancy. i would be pleased to answer any further queries that you may have, enjoy a wonderful day."

"hello doctor , i have grade 1 fatty liver i am 23yrs old and i weigh 110kgs .i am not diabetic , thyroid reports also show normal behaviour , i have this fullness in my chest area which makes me feel more heavier and i hate this feeling . i am taking company and with it level . i want to know in how much time will my liver recover and what to do about this fullness in my chest ?",1,97352,"hi, how are you? my name is chat doctor. i am a liver and pancreas specialist and i hope to answer your question today. i am so sorry to hear that you are feeling depressed about your condition. but there is no need to be, as it is very easy to treat. fatty liver can be caused by excessive alcohol intake (alcoholic seato hepatitis, ash) or due to excessive fatty food intake and sedentary lifestyle (non-alcoholic seato hepatitis, nash). ash is usually the beginning stages of alcohol induced liver damage and is completely reversible if the patient refrains from alcohol. nash is being much more commonly diagnosed currently owing to poor dietary habits and sedentary lifestyles of people. high caloric intake, high fatty food intake and poor exercise regimens lead to deposition of fat goblets in the liver tissue leading to fatty liver (which shows up as increased echo texture on usg). this is also completely reversible in the initial stages if caloric intake is limited and exercise regimens are adhered to. if left unchecked, patients usually become obese, diabetic and in final stages may lead to cirrhosis of the liver which will necessitate a liver transplant. i would suggest a healthy diet and exercise regimen. although there is no time limit on when to get a repeat scan, i would suggest one, once you have succeeded in losing some weight. hope this helped and hope you start to feel better. please do not hesitate to contact me for further details. have a great day."

him daughter who is 4 yrs old gets fever along with chest congestion very often along with breathing difficulty.x-ray and cup reports are showing normal.so what could be the reason for the breathing difficulty and frequent fever.whom should i consult again ? kindly reply .thank you,2,14427,"hey there, thank you for your question and welcome to chat doctor. first off, why is your daughter having difficulty breathing? is it due to the nasal congestion or because her tonsils are enlarged? the sound that she makes while sleeping could be due to the stuffy nose. she is having to compensate for air so she's mouth breathing. you are probably also hearing chest congestion if she has a cold. if you hear a high pitch whistle sound called wheezing, then i would recommend a visit back to the doctor to make sure her airway isn't being affected by her swollen tonsils. the medications that you listed are exactly what i would want to see given to her. strep throat is treated with antibiotics and that is what the literal is for. remember, with any antibiotics, it will take 2-3 days before her symptoms start to resolve. the fever, sore throat and ulcers will usually still be present during the first 24-36 hours. the two other medications you listed are to make her comfortable in terms of her nasal congestion and other cold symptoms. i would have to agree with the doctor who prescribed the medications and say that it is a good treatment plan. hopefully your little one will start to feel better quickly. have a good day!"

"a went to the dr. and complained that i felt like a was losing my mind . pm have super . pm having a lot of memory loss problems . a can be talking to someone the nested thing a done ever remember the talk , go places not remember how a got there . after going to bedmovements all wake up and roll over and not remember who the man in my bed is ( my husband of 28 yrs ) . by dr. said a have arrive dyskinesia , a do have involuntargive movement with face and hands . but i am more worried about my los of memory .",1,105496,"his am chat doctor. i have read your message. i think i can help you. first, i do not think that your prior stroke is involved. what you have described is a type of aphasia neurologically speaking. and aphasia is usually caused by a left sided brain problem-not right like you state in your query. second, if it was truly due to the stroke, the problem would have been since 2009. brain problems in stroke don't get delayed. so, i don't think that your prior stroke has anything to do with the issue. second, the main causes of aphasia are stroke and dementia. it is not a stroke as per prior ct scan, and not dementia-dementia is memory loss, and from the query, your memory is pretty good-you remember the year 2009 clearly (suggests long term memory is good), and you remember the medicines (suggests short term memory is good as well). so like your doctors, i don't think its dementia either. however, i disagree with the choice of investigations- the ct has clearly missed your pre-existing stroke as well. so i cannot be sure whether it has missed a newer stroke as well. so, i would have ideally suggested another mri brain (a more sensitive study than cat scan) and a cv doppler. however, i still don't think it is a stroke. a stroke starts suddenly. and you have definitely not said that there was a sudden onset of symptoms. if however you have forgotten to mention this in the query, you should definitely think about stroke and plan an mri and cv doppler as suggested before. third, a significant history that you have given is the loss of work and lack of hobbies and physical exercises. i won't call it depression or anxiety. and therefore i don't think your medicines will work either. in your case, the age-old adage-all work and no play makes jack a dull boy-is probably most appropriate. so my suggestion is that you need to stop smoking and get some company and daily activities. it may sound odd to you, but inactivity does take its toll. i don't think medicines are needed in your case. you just need to fill in your time with more activities so that your mind is active again. i have tried to make it as simple as possible for you to understand. feel free to ask another query with a specific doubt based on the information i have given you. i would be happy to help you further. best of luck,"

"i , a a 33 weigh 135 la height 5 3 and in 5 months pregnant and have cramps with light pink discharge . that could that be ? by second main question is what can a do about my panic attacks , a don to take anything since a found out a was pregnant . before a was pregnant a was taking gabapentin and trazadone . please help me .",1,97281,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. many women accidentally ingest medications or alcohol before they find out that they are pregnant. however, there is no fetus that even develops before the 7th week or so, so the effects of medications on a developing fetus would not yet be able to pose any harm to the pregnancy. furthermore, there are only a few, very strong iv antibiotics that can actually cause significant harm to a developing fetus. so it is unlikely that the antibiotic that your wife was taking was even unsafe during pregnancy. asking whether a woman is pregnant when prescribing medication is a common routine practice and does not mean that the medication prescribed is in any way. so in summary, i do not think you need to be worried about the medication your wife took in this very early stage. to enhance the health of her pregnancy, she should follow a well-balanced diet, avoid alcohol, and begin to take a vitamin supplement designed for pregnant women. your should also choose a prenatal care provider for her and have your first visit about a month from now. i hope i was able to adequate;y answer your question today, and that my advice was reassuring. best wishes,"

"hello ! a am 19 years old . recently , a be been getting random numbness in the middle toes on both of my feet . a be also suffered from kidney stones for the last 7 years . someone told me that problems in your kidneys can cause numbness in your toes ... would these things be related ? a a beginning to worry about the toe numbness .",1,108445,"hit hank you for your question to chat doctor. these findings indicate that the dimensions of the spinal canal have changes. the space available for the nerves has been compromised and that is leading to compression of the nerves. for my patients i always interpret the mri findings in relation to clinical signs and symptoms. specifically the stenosis you have mentioned can cause right leg pain on the back or front of thigh. it may also cause a feeling of pain/heaviness or numbness in legs particularly on standing or walking or even weakness of feet/toes in some cases. if this is the case the narrowing discs are the cause of symptoms. pain medications like ibuprofen, meloxicam, tramadol and lifestyle modification as well as physical therapy are the first line of treatment. epidural injections in spine can be done if pain does not respond to these. pure back pain without any leg pain/tingling/numbness is unlikely to be caused by these findings in mri. hope this is helpful. i would be happy to answer any question you may have."

by mon has been diagnosed with cirrhosis unspecific . by brother as well because of hemachromatosis . by sister with unspecified cirrhosis . myself diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis . by question is could there be a shared factor that doctors are missing ? why would we have different kinds ?,2,104106,"hello, i have gone through your problem. you have been diagnosed as having hepatitis b virus in your body. this condition is known as hbs ag +ve. first you need to know something about your condition. many people may get affected by this virus. usually the mode of transmission is by using infected needles, blood transfusion and may also be transmitted sexually. in many patients the virus persists in the body for less than 6 months. if the virus persists for more than 6 months then we call that person as carrier. healthy carriers are patients in whom the virus persists but will not affect the liver. so the chances of these patients landing up with cirrhosis of liver is almost nil. in some carriers the virus slowly attacks the liver and this is known as chronic active hepatitis. this can cause cirrhosis of liver. overall if you see, out of the patients affected with this virus only 2-3% may have this chronic active hepatitis and may land up with liver cirrhosis. as you have been detected to be hbs ag +ve, you need to be further evaluated with some more blood tests to check the viral dna load. if its in early stage the chances for a complete cure might be there with interferon injections. but they are very expensive. my advice is you need to consult a gastroenterologist or hepatologist so that he can further evaluate you and can suggest you regarding the use of interferons. good luck to you."

the center of my chest popped and pain is coming and going . feels like i cracked my chest plate and its kind of hard to breath without feeling some pain . pm very worried because in uninsured and cant afford to go to the hospital . that is wrong ? is it serious ? this has been happening for about a year or 2 and gets worse as years go by ..,1,15046,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. feeling short of breath is not unusual while you're pregnant because the hormones of pregnancy actually have a way of telling your brain to breathe faster. this is to ensure that your baby gets enough oxygen, because as your belly gets bigger your lungs are not able to expand as well. so many women feel the sensation of needing to catch their breath all the time when they breathe when they are in the third trimester. in addition, because you would have been on bed rest for so long, you probably are not in very good cardiovascular shape. another possible reason why you could be feeling short of breath is that there is a possibility that you are anemic. normally, as part of routine prenatal care we check your blood count as well is a test for gestational diabetes somewhere between 24 and 28 weeks. if you've not yet had this test, it might be a good idea to mention your symptoms to your doctor. of course, there can be some serious, dangerous things that can cause shortness of breath; like blood clots that spread to your lung, or fluid in the lungs and other pulmonary problems. if you experience any chest pain or severe shortness of breath or start developing a productive cough, you should notify your doctor immediately and possibly go to the hospital for evaluation. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

yesterday after eating some cereal my chest began to hurt really bad it started in my left side all the way down to my breast .. now every time i eat or swallow food or water burp or even laugh it hurts lot .. it keeps coming no matter what i do it feels like some pressure or some ones squeezing my throat bad in only 18 can it be a heartattack sign ?,1,34552,"the only thing for a cold sensation i can think of is acid reflux. when you get heart burn it feels crazy and can give anxiety (hence the rapid heart rate). you can remedy acid reflux (herd, or heart burn, throat burn or whatever you want to call it) by getting some digestive enzymes (try something like source naturals daily digestive enzymes) at a local vitamin store (or try vitacost.com) and till give her enough digestive juices to help grind up her food better. also, food intolerances will cause problems too. i discovered a food intolerance to wheat, milk and peanuts. but you have to write down how you feel after you eat something and try eliminating it for a while and see how it goes. you can ask a doctor for an elisa test (for food allergies) but it doesn't tell us much. a food elimination/rotation diet is much better plus it can't hurt. a sharp knife like feeling is definitely heart burn from what i've felt or heard about. make sure you write down when these things occur, what time and how long (dates) and what she had to eat earlier. pizza is a biggie on heart burn. hot dogs, anything with bad fats in it. bread if she is intolerant to wheat and so on. i would throw in a thyroid (tsh) test for hyper or hypothyroidism. so many symptoms stem from those diseases (difficulty breathing, rapid heart rate, digestion issues and so on)...that it should be warranted just to rule it out. and if it keeps happening see the doc. but sometimes i do believe we have to be our own detectives. my dd has a friend that was ill on and off for a couple of years and saw 11 doctors (hello, aren't they supposed to be intelligent beings?) but no, they couldn't figure out anything. finally, they figured out she has a gluten-allergy."

"a had pain in the center of the upper abdomen on and off for 3 days . it felt like contractions and lasted 5-10 seconds each time . a few days later a had an abdominal sonogram which shows hepatic parenchyma that is homogeneous , no evidence of intrahepatic biliary ducal dilation , no hepatic mass seen , the right lobe of the liver measure 18.1 pm , no ascites , gallbladder is normal in appearance and no gallstones or monographic evidence of cholecystitis , the common bile duct measures 8.9 my , the pancreas has a normal monographic appearance and the abdominal aorta is normal in caliper . it was recommended to have an mri/mrcp to evaluate . to you have any thoughts about this ? thank you .",1,85573,"hi, thanks for writing in to us. i will explain your ultrasound findings in simple language.1. liver: measure 128.9 mm, parenchymal show normal echogenicity. intrahepatic biliary radicals, common bile duct (1.6 mm) and portal vein (5.3 mm) are normal. liver size and appearance is normal. the common bile duct is the main tube through which bile is transported into the duodenum and that is also normal. the portal vein carries blood and that is also normal.2. gall bladder contracted. normal wall thickness. lumen shows multiple echogenic loci - calculi. gall bladder may contain calculi (many small stones perhaps). it is important to know the approximate size of stones and probably number of stones present. a surgeon will be the best person to discuss the problem. also, please tell him about any pains you are experiencing.10% of general population may have an asymptomatic gall bladder stone and nothing needs to be done. in the others having multiple stones, medical treatment is first given and if situation does not improve, only then surgery may be necessary. hope this helps"

i have fluctuation in platelet counts ... it goes as much less as 50 % of the minimum count and becomes normal without any medication after a week or so . now i am in trimester ( 6th week ) . we this have any complications in my pregnancy . what diet should i take to increase my platelet count,1,42743,"hi there, more than the fluctuations in platelet count, we need to make sure that it doesn't get to be less than 1 lakh/dl. platelets are known to fluctuate in pregnancy. but the lowest level should not be less than one lakh. as this will need precautions during delivery. and platelet levels less than 50,000 do sometimes require platelet transfusions. but do not worry as most low platelets in pregnancy are gestational and revert to normal themselves after delivery. there is not much relation of platelets to diet and there is no recommended diet. hope this helps. regards."

hi there i been having a massive pain starting from the lower jumbo sacral region i cant sit for long since sunday night all of a sudden . neither i can walk properly and micturition is very difficult including coughing . i have seen a surgeon he has given me antacid and diclofenac twice daily ... the pain has subsidized as off now till the effect of painkillers but if i stop taking them the pain resurfaces back again although not like the one i had 3 days before but its like a chronic pain and it goes down the legs ? has been advised a week of complete bed rest . just want to know is it a sciatica pain ?,1,26956,"hi, thanks for writing in. it appears that you have developed complication of chronic lower back condition. you might have had advanced degenerative changes in your lower back involving the sacral segments and lumbar spine which has been there for many years. this is a possibility that this degenerative change has progressed since and has developed in to changes like a degenerative cyst in the region. as you report a lump on the right side of your spine, it will help is a detailed investigation like mri spine is done and discussed with your doctor. the degenerative cysts can cause a lot of pressure on the nerve roots in the region leading to pain and discomfort. treatment is guided with the intention of removing any pressure on the affected nerve roots and decompressing the nerve. non-surgical methods of treatment can work if there is mild pressure on the nerve roots. please do not worry."

a have been diagnosed with an enlarged spleen . a biopsy was recently done and now a biopsy of the liver is planned . a have also been diagnosed with a gallbladder problem which is going to be removed at the same time the biopsy of the liver is done . that are they looking for and what might they find ?,3,100031,"the major concern with this ultrasound is the cirrhotic liver with ascites. when the liver is badly damaged with scarring (cirrhosis), it doesn't work very well. blood flowing through the scarred liver gets backed up and creates high pressure in the liver, which in turn results in fluid leaking in to the abdomen (ascites). unfortunately, cirrhosis with ascites may be an indication that his liver is starting to fail. the kidney shows that a stone is present, but that does not seem to be causing any problems. no other findings are of significance. what needs to be done now is to take a sample of the ascites fluid and determine if it is truly related to the liver cirrhosis or something else. liver disease is the most common cause of ascites, but other conditions may cause it as well, and treatment may differ. further investigation of the liver status may also be needed, such as a biopsy. usually the spleen is enlarged when ascites develops with a cirrhotic liver, and his spleen is normal, so perhaps another more treatable condition is present. liver failure from cirrhosis is the worst case scenario. further evaluation should help define his situation better. hope this helps."

"hello , i had triple by pass surgery 15 months ago and i am on several beds and i see a doctor at a free health clinic , no in , recently i have been getting missed heart beats quite regularly and it is disturbing to me and i can not get in touch with my doctor until my next visit next month should i go to the emergency room right away",1,57686,"hello and thank you for using chat doctor. i carefully read your question and i understand your concern. i will try to explain you something and give you my opinion. in your case we have to deal with two different problems but strongly related with each other, hypertension and rhythm issue. we talk about hypertension if we have mean value that exceeds 140 / 90 mmhg. a person might have high value during emotional and physicals trees so it's mandatory to judge on mean values. fast heart beats might be a simple sinus tachycardia. this mean that your heart beats over 100 beats for minute. but it might be another kind of arrhythmia like atrial fibrillation. it means that your heart beats in a chaotic way. hypertension might lead to fast heart beats, but also an arrhythmia might rise blood pressure. so, if i was your treating doctor i will recommend some examination like an electrocardiogram, a cardiac echo to evaluate heart function and walls, a full blood analyze, a holder rhythm and pressure monitoring. these is not urgent examination, you can wait until the appointment with your doctor. only if it happens again to have fast heart beats that last for several minutes and if they seem irregular i would recommend you to go directly to the emergency room. in this case, through an electrocardiogram we can catch a rhythm issue if it is any. hope i was helpful. wish you good health. best regards."

""b"" these devices are great for grinding. i prefer hard night guards because the firmness helps prevent them from breaking down and they don't flex like soft night guards which in your sleep may be perceived as food and induce more grinding. i personally use a night guard and found that it has improved my bruise condition greatly. they are well worth the money. best regards and good health"

i a am 18 years old and a a taking the birthcontrol pill . a take them everyday at the same time but recently with work a be missed about 4 days . a started to bleed and a thought or was my period . but it only lasted 4 days . to a took some pregnancy test and they all showed up negative . 2-3 days later a be started to bleed again but brown and everyday its getting heavier and heavier ans a need to take my new pack of pills . that should a do ?,1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

my mother was diagnosed with peritoneal cancer stage 3 . the doctors never made it clear if this was mesothelium or not . going research peritoneal is never listed as a cancer in itself but it is listed under mesothelium . of her biopsy says she has peritoneal stage 3 cancer does this mean it is mesothelium or could it be another type of peritoneal cancer ? thank you,1,42929,thanks for your question on chat doctor. peritoneal malignancies (primary) are very rare. malignant spread in peritoneum can occur in other organ malignancies. but primary peritoneal cancer is very rare. the most common one in this is mesothelioma. mesothelioma is the only peritoneal cancer known. it is also affecting pleura. so if your mother is also having pleural involvement than this must be mesothelioma only. prognosis is not very good. chemotherapy is the only treatment available. rarely radiotherapy given.

"i . a get stabbing pains in my stomach after a eat or drink anything , including just water , also when a cough . the pain feels like a need to go to the toilet , but most times a done . to you have any idea what this could be , or how to do something about it ?",1,91337,"hi there. based on what you are telling me, i am a little concerned that your water may have broken. i'm not sure how long this has been going on or what you were doing when it started, but i definitely think it would be a good idea to go in for evaluation. if your water is broken at 20 weeks, you will likely need to be on bed rest for a while. having your water break at 20 weeks can pose a threat to the baby and to you, namely, infection. if this watery discharge continues, please go get evaluated. it could also be completely normal, but it sounds like you know what normal feels like. good luck!"

"yes i started with a bump that was small on the back of my head , that grew larger in 3 weeks . it had a redness around . sent to the doctors , and he said it was a reactive lymph node . be said not to worry it will go down . it is still there , and now ( not to get dirty ) i shaved my below region , and a bump formed around my groin . same hard feeling that was in my head . i thought it was a ingrown hair so i kept shaving but now it has gotten worse . and is red and swollen . i have no idea what it is !",1,9208,"dear user, thanks for the question. the lump you have described fits the description of a skin cyst, called sebaceous cyst. the first thing about them is they are non-cancerous. these happen because of ingrowing of hair with an excessive secretion of glands around it to raise the bump. so although they can occur on part of body, these are more likely to appear in the parts which are hairy and shaved. other sites could be faced, neck, and torso. the contents whicchatdoctore out of it will be thickened and could have black in it because of the hair. it is less likely for an insect to embed in the skin, especially when there was no redness to suggest insect bite. now that you have already emptied it, it might or might not collect again. if it does, you will need to get it removed. as if this cyst is recurrent or stays for long, there are chances that it gets infected. in the case of infection, you will need a course of antibiotics plus minus require chat doctor. hope i answered the question and related concerns. plaese write back if you need further information. thanks"

a have a question about a false positive pregnancy test . a have taken 8 tests over the past week and all of them have been positive . a also have pcs and am on closed . by app . with my doctor is friday . a am just worried about ovarian cysts and false positive pregnancy tests . is it possible that this is what is going on ?,1,110086,"hello thanks for your query. residual cysts are not the same as corpus luteum cyst. after stimulation with gonadotropin like goal f, there is multimolecular stimulation of the ovaries - that is instead of one egg, many eggs (follicles) mature simultaneously. all of them do not rupture at ovulation, and some follicles give rise to residual cysts. however, corpus luteum is the structure that supports a growing pregnancy. false positives with urine pregnancy tests are common, not just with corpus luteal cuts, but also various other causes. as you have been trying to conceive for seven years now, this is a precious pregnancy for you. please do not waste time, and consult a gynecologist, as if it is an early pregnancy, you definitely need proper guidance and medications. i think it is definitely worthwhile, since residual cysts do not give false positive test, and with a positive test, you definitely need confirmation and ultrasound at the earliest. take care"

"i , a work third shift and have problems sleeping . recently a have had hip pain that a believed to be from working and carrying heavy items . today a have felt short of breath and now am feeling an empty sensation in my chest . should a consult my doctor ?",1,15046,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. feeling short of breath is not unusual while you're pregnant because the hormones of pregnancy actually have a way of telling your brain to breathe faster. this is to ensure that your baby gets enough oxygen, because as your belly gets bigger your lungs are not able to expand as well. so many women feel the sensation of needing to catch their breath all the time when they breathe when they are in the third trimester. in addition, because you would have been on bed rest for so long, you probably are not in very good cardiovascular shape. another possible reason why you could be feeling short of breath is that there is a possibility that you are anemic. normally, as part of routine prenatal care we check your blood count as well is a test for gestational diabetes somewhere between 24 and 28 weeks. if you've not yet had this test, it might be a good idea to mention your symptoms to your doctor. of course, there can be some serious, dangerous things that can cause shortness of breath; like blood clots that spread to your lung, or fluid in the lungs and other pulmonary problems. if you experience any chest pain or severe shortness of breath or start developing a productive cough, you should notify your doctor immediately and possibly go to the hospital for evaluation. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

a got a decayed tooth and last year i have placed a crown for my teeth . now its terribly paining and the crown has come little down . at should i do ?,3,49804,it's normal to have some discomfort after act completion for 1 to 2 weeks. the root canal filling makes the tooth tender. the reason for your pain can also be food impaction around the cut tooth which is the space created to fit the crown. if your dentist has done the rct procedure well then your pain will go in another week or so. meanwhile you should avoid chewing food from the affected side. take some anti-inflammatory chat doctor. and most importantly while getting the crown placed be sure that all the teeth are in contact. sometimes the new crown is high relative to adjacent teeth and this can aggravate the pain. take care
