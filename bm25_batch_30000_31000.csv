"hi , doc ! just want to ask regarding my wife having constant back pain below her shoulder on both sides . she was diagnosed with enlargement of the heart and i forgot the term the doctor used but it was like a vessel of her heart is getting smaller hole due to blocking the inside wall of her vessel . and recently she was working some chores her in the house and felt too much fatigue that she couldn't even stand alone just this morning . but now she still felt the backpack and fatigue that bothers her . thanks and best regards , ranger",1,52429,"hello hiram.ks10, thank you for posting your query through chat doctor. i can understand your concern for your granny. radiation is the method of treatment of choice for this type of cancers by the conventional medicine. you can ask for the outcome what the doctors expect out of the treatment and the percentage of chances for her to get cured and survive. i am a homeopath, and so i will be advising you differently, and it is for you to take the judicious decision about it. in my opinion your granny must have undergone a shocking psychological conflict at this age almost prior to the development of the stricture of the esophagus. on examination of the throat for difficulty in swallowing it was found out that esophagus is having this deformity. it is said that she had an experience of something that she could not swallow. now you may go back to her life situations and find out whether she had anything that she could not swallow. get to know what she felt- whether rejection, indignation, grief, rage, depression etc.- towards this incident. this will tell her genetics. the cause of any cancer is in the mind and is mediated through the brain. which tissue is to be affected and what should be the type of affection-all these are determined by the mind-brain - organ axis. give her homeopathic constitutional treatment for giving maximum possible longevity of relatively healthful days ahead. abstain from radiation or any other unnatural surgical procedures. if you so desire, i can help her by taking her case in detail and prescribe for her, her genetic constitutional curative remedy. give counselling to her in the fashion i explained her disease above and request her to have positive attitudes to the incident and to her present disease condition. with best wishes, chat doctor. j. varese, homeopath,"

hello i have got a question there a problem which has been cause during the last three weeks to one of my friend he get swelling on his right leg and he get the swelling on his stomach to he is a sugar patient and the health condition is a critical situation do a know how i could get a help in that case its urgently waiting for or reply,1,29993,"hello jay naresh, i understand your grandfathers' problem. he has swelling of the legs from the blockage of his lymph vessels and this can lead to oozing of lymph if there is any scratch or abrasion. this problem is produced by the dead worms in his lymphatic system especially in the lymph nodes. his fever can be due to two reasons. if he has an infection of his leg or if he has microfibril in the blood. a night blood sample examined for micrfilaria may show it if it is present, and then it should be treated with the medicine diethylcarbamazine (betrayal). if there is infection of the leg abrasion or ulceration he would require local and systemic antibiotics. the important way to avoid infection is to keep the legs clean and take care that he walks around only with protective footwear and to wash the legs every day with water and mild disinfectant.also, please check whether he suffers from diabetes which will increase his chance of infection. if he is in good health surgical removal of the swelling can also be considered, for which you can consult a surgeon. if you have further queries, i am ready to answer them. best wishes,"

okay so in 43 and my whole body shakes all over when i start to get up and it feels like some 1 is standing on my chest the world feels like its shaking fast its hard to see my eye sight is becoming poor it feels like there is a fog in my brain and and i feel like in going it faint my heart beats really fast then suddenly slows to like 2 beats light and my heart feels heavy and arms and limbs are really weak some tomes when in out about i get small shake but i got to tell myself not to bend down this has been getting worse since march 2011,1,25338,"hello and thank you for using chat doctor. i carefully read your question and understand your concern. but you should not worry, its nothing serious. as you describe, my opinion is that it might be a rhythm issue. someone can feel strong and fast heart beats for different reasons. it may be a simple sinus tachycardia. this means that the heart is beating faster than 100 beats for minute. its normal range in a resting condition is between 60-100 beats for minute. when it goes up you may feel a strong heart beat in your chest and a sensation like your body is beating too. another reason for this sensation might be what we call an ekstrasystol.these is electrical heart impulses that generates in some parts of heart different from normal sinus rhythm. this generates an escaped beat that the person feels like jumping ore bumping. it gives the sensation like a beat is skipping, may experience palpitations or an anxiety sensation that your daughter explains like trembling. this extrasistoles may happen from different reasons from simple emotional stress to other pathologies like anemia, hyperthyroidism etc. so, my opinion as cardiologist is that you have nothing to worry. it is just a simple episode, and it is quite normal in younger ages. only if these symptoms persist and begins to interfere the daily live, if i was your treating doctor i will recommend some examinations like a blood analysis to exclude anemia, the thyroid hormones, an electrocardiogram, echocardiography and of course a holder monitoring. this will help us to document and see what happens with heart rhythm. at meantime, i will recommend your daughter to avoid coffee, caffeine products because they rise heart frequency and extrasistolic beats. i encourage her to have physical training because sometimes it helps in reducing extrasistoles, tachycardia, even making them disappear. wish i was helpful. take good care. best regards"

"i , a am 19 years old and my periods are usually irregular and when i get on birth control they usually regulate . a recently started a new birth control and was suppose to start my period 3 days ago but i haven started it yet , although i am having the symptoms as if i were but no bleeding . that could this mean ?",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"
"i , a am 19 years old and my periods are usually irregular and when i get on birth control they usually regulate . a recently started a new birth control and was suppose to start my period 3 days ago but i haven started it yet , although i am having the symptoms as if i were but no bleeding . that could this mean ?",2,77098,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. many women who have been on birth control for many years can develop a tolerance of sorts for the pills' ability to control your menstrual cycle, especially after they have not menstruated for a long time due to pregnancy or another cause. this can also occur to the fact that you did relatively recently give birth, especially if you were breastfeeding. bleeding when you are not supposed to have your period on the pill is called breakthrough bleeding. it does not mean the pill is ineffective as a contraceptive, but having some irregular bleeding in between periods or a different bleeding pattern that you may have had before the pregnancy is not unusual. having heavy bleeding in the morning is likely due to the blood accumulating in your vagina during the night, and then it all comes out at once when you get out of bed due to gravity. your cycle may get back to normal after a few more months on the pill, and taking it as close to the same time every day will help to reduce the risk of breakthrough bleeding. if it continues for more than 3 months, you may benefit from changing your birth control brand to one with a slightly higher dose of estrogen, as the estrogen in the pill is the ingredient that controls your menstrual cycle. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"hello doctor my son is 9 years old from age of 2 , he is having asthma by that time docs told at the age8 he will be alright but still he is having the problem and he stammers when he have cold & coughing afterwards also it continues what to do , please help me",1,30133,"hello. thank you for asking at chat doctor. most of the childhood asthma improve with age and subside by 7-8 years as told by your doctor. however, exact age at which the child will be alright cannot be told and of course, some child chat doctor. so if your sons' asthma has improved over years (that is, he is having fewer attacks of asthma than he used to have before, or he is requiring fewer doses of inhaler medicines that he used to require before), i would not worry. however, if his asthma has not improved as suggested above, i would think he may have an allergic asthma which continues into adolescent and adult age. in such case i would suggest you to consult an allergist-immunologist who will after detailed history taking suggest your son allergy testing, which is necessary to know what he is allergic to. breathing exercises & avoidance of amoke-dust-air pollution will help him a lot improve his asthma. regarding stammering, it is a speech disorder and is not directly related to asthma. however, psychological issues such as low self-esteem (which may be due to having asthma) can contribute to stammering. i would suggest you to stay positive towards him, encourage him and get a help from a speech therapist who will suggest some speech exercises for stammering. hope this will be helpful to you. wish your son the best of the health. regards."

(regular use of emergency pill is harmful)conception occurs if she was in 10th to 18th day of her cycle(in a regular cycle of 28 day duration). you can ask her at what day she is in and wait for next cycle to occur. if it delayed by 7 days then get done upt to diagnose if pregnant and then the required treatment can be taken. regards"

"good morning .... a have been diagnosed with high bilirubin levels , a have a whole body itch , bumps that started out as 1 on the testicle then spread from the testicles to the penis , then the bottom , legs , chest and back . an these bumps and persistent itching be connected to the high bilirubin level ? thank you",1,65018,"hi thanks for the question. i assume that your baby is more than a week old. most of the babies have yellow discoloration of skin and sclera during the first few days of life. this is called physiological jaundice, and it subsides on its own without any intervention. this is a normal phenomenon as a result of transition from fetal to extrauterine life. you should be aware when jaundice is a cause of concern: 1. if jaundice appears on first day of life2. if the level of bilirubin is more than 12 mg/dl. bilirubin is the substance that causes the yellow coloration of skin. its level can be checked with a blood test .3. if the rise in bilirubin level is more than 5 mg/dl/hr. for this your doctor my prescribe repeated test and then plot the levels on a graph to predict the expected rise in bilirubin.4. if direct bilirubin is more the 2 mg/dl or 20% of the total. bilirubin is of two types physiological jaundice is due to the water insoluble indirect bilirubin so if direct component is high it means it's not physiological and should be a cause for concern. the direct and indirect breakage is given in the blood test. 5. if your baby is otherwise unwell e.g. is lethargic, is not feeding well, has fever or difficulty breathing then its not physiological jaundice because in that case your baby will be otherwise totally ok. you have asked if your baby needs incubator care. incubators are for premature babies who can not maintain their body temperatures as they have arrived earlier, and temperature control mechanisms have not yet been established. the incubator provides specific temperature. incubators are not used for the treatment of any type of jaundice. phototherapy is used for that. these are specially lights that convert the indirect water insoluble bilirubin into water soluble forms that can then be excreted out through urine. as i have told high levels of direct bilirubin are a cause of concern and these need treatment with a phototherapy unit. your doctor may prescribe phototherapy if your child has any of the criteria i have mentioned earlier, but incubator care is not needed as your baby is not premature and is at least older than a week. if you have any other questions i will be happy to answer."

(if your pediatrician does not write separately). this is going to help in a long run for a healthy baby. give a shot of tablet for worms. follow orthopedic surgeon for the growth at bone. i hope this helps you and your son to get a cure. give a long term treatment and diet training is also a must (i know how 6-year-old are)

why is it that my boyfriend gets a fever of 103 everyday for last week at the same time with extreme chills after ? ? he went and got blood work done and everything was normal except his white blood cells were elevated . and the area around his liver was tender but liver tests were normal,1,30173,"hi. thank you for writing to chat doctor. your boyfriend seems to be presenting a pattern of fever that is typical in malarial infections. i would recommend that you have his blood tested for qbc malaria or a peripheral smear (whichever is available). the fever spikes when the parasites enter the blood and subsides when they hide inside an organ. liver being tender is also suggestive of malaria (liver function tests may be normal in early stages). also since his abcs are elevated it does indicate an infection. it would be useful to know the differentials such as if neutrophils are raised then it suggests a bacterial infection and in that case typhoid must be ruled out. if lymphocytes are elevated then it may be viral and dengue must be ruled out. therefore, it is my opinion that you have him evaluated for this fever of unknown origin by a physician for a detailed work up, blood tests and ultrasound of the liver or may be ct scan of the abdomen. based on the results appropriate management may be indicated. currently, paracetamol to reduce fever is the only symptomatic option. management for malaria, typhoid and dengue vary considerably. hope this helps. do let me know if you have any other questions."

"hello , so a was barefoot and taking out the trash and a stepped on something in the garage ( the area affected is my right big toe ) . initially a thought it was a thorn , but there is no evidence of that , there is just excruciating pain , tingling and numbness , no blood or anything like that and a can to seem to see anything in my toe . a went beck out there to see if maybe a stepped on a dead bee or some sort of spider but i could to find anything . the pain tingling and numbness effects are getting worse as well ...",1,13930,"hello, and thank you for your question. fortunately, you probably do not have fibromyalgia. there are several possible causes of pain just in the toe. if there is a pinched nerve in the lower spine, it can cause pain that can be just in one toe. if this is the case, you may find that the pain is worse with change in position, such as lying flat or standing up. pain in the toe, typically the big toe, is common in a disorder called gout, in which the body has too much uric acid. the pain usually lasts a few days at a time, and is usually associated with redness and swelling. pain in the toes can be caused by corns or other skin problems that look small but feel very severe. pins and needles, shooting, on-and-off pains can be caused by irritation to a nerve by diabetes, by lack of vitamins such as b12, or by pressure - similar to the ""foot falling asleep"" feeling we sometimes get if we cross our legs too long. fibromyalgia, on the other hand, is usually a ""pain all over"" problem - back pain, neck pain, arm pain, knee pain, without another cause such as arthritis. it usually does not cause just one part of the body to hurt - most patients say that ""everything hurts"". in my practice, i start with finding out as much as i can from the patient about how the pain feels and how long it has been going on, and if it seems related to anything else. then we examine the foot to look for anything going on with the skin, check if the nerves of the foot are normally sensitive, not as sensitive as usual, or more sensitive, and then we may check blood tests to detect diabetes or vitamin deficiency or other problems as needed. fibromyalgia is diagnosed by obtaining a careful history of where the patient is having pain, other medical problems, and completing a physical exam including what is called a ""painful point"" exam where the doctor pushes at certain places in the body - on the back and near the joints - to see if this causes pain. i hope that my answer to your question is helpful. if you have any further questions, please check back with us. i hope your toe is much better soon."

"my 4year old child has stomach ache , doctor checked and told that the bilirubin level is high , but there is no other symptoms for jaundice . be still have the stomach ache sometimes especially after eating some kind of foods . what would be the cause of of the abdomen pain if it is not jaundice . thanks doc .",1,65018,"hi thanks for the question. i assume that your baby is more than a week old. most of the babies have yellow discoloration of skin and sclera during the first few days of life. this is called physiological jaundice, and it subsides on its own without any intervention. this is a normal phenomenon as a result of transition from fetal to extrauterine life. you should be aware when jaundice is a cause of concern: 1. if jaundice appears on first day of life2. if the level of bilirubin is more than 12 mg/dl. bilirubin is the substance that causes the yellow coloration of skin. its level can be checked with a blood test .3. if the rise in bilirubin level is more than 5 mg/dl/hr. for this your doctor my prescribe repeated test and then plot the levels on a graph to predict the expected rise in bilirubin.4. if direct bilirubin is more the 2 mg/dl or 20% of the total. bilirubin is of two types physiological jaundice is due to the water insoluble indirect bilirubin so if direct component is high it means it's not physiological and should be a cause for concern. the direct and indirect breakage is given in the blood test. 5. if your baby is otherwise unwell e.g. is lethargic, is not feeding well, has fever or difficulty breathing then its not physiological jaundice because in that case your baby will be otherwise totally ok. you have asked if your baby needs incubator care. incubators are for premature babies who can not maintain their body temperatures as they have arrived earlier, and temperature control mechanisms have not yet been established. the incubator provides specific temperature. incubators are not used for the treatment of any type of jaundice. phototherapy is used for that. these are specially lights that convert the indirect water insoluble bilirubin into water soluble forms that can then be excreted out through urine. as i have told high levels of direct bilirubin are a cause of concern and these need treatment with a phototherapy unit. your doctor may prescribe phototherapy if your child has any of the criteria i have mentioned earlier, but incubator care is not needed as your baby is not premature and is at least older than a week. if you have any other questions i will be happy to answer."
"my 4year old child has stomach ache , doctor checked and told that the bilirubin level is high , but there is no other symptoms for jaundice . be still have the stomach ache sometimes especially after eating some kind of foods . what would be the cause of of the abdomen pain if it is not jaundice . thanks doc .",2,19432,"hi, thanks for using the chat doctor. i am happy to ad chat doctor. jaundice causes yellow skin and eyes because of an excess amount of the bile pigment bilirubin in the fat layer under the skin. either the body is producing too much, or it's not getting rid of it fast enough. the liver breaks down old, inefficient red blood cells in a process called hemolysis. this releases large amounts of bilirubin. some causes of jaundice due to poor liver function include viral hepatitis a, b, c, d, and e can all cause temporary liver inflammation. types b and c can also cause chronic, lifelong inflammation. cause of jaundice due to obstruction (blockage) include gallstones formed in the gallbladder, others can be due to excessive red blood cell destruction as in malaria, the liver destroys red blood cells infected with the parasite. if a fever or flu-like illness comes before jaundice, it's usually a sign of a viral hepatitis infection. brown urine, common in hepatitis, is generally a sign of poor liver function or increased red blood cell destruction. the body is trying to get rid of excess bilirubin in the urine. pale, white, or clay-coloured stool, on the other hand, is an indicator of obstruction in the gallbladder or bile ducts. jaundice itself is unlikely to hurt you unless the bilirubin reaches very high concentrations. it is a sign, however, of an underlying problem. would recommend you show your child to a doctor if you think you have jaundice. a blood sample will also be taken and checked for hepatitis virus antibodies, abnormal red blood cells, bilirubin levels, and various other substances that give clues about liver function. your doctor may also order other tests such as an ultrasound to determine the cause of jaundice. there's no treatment for jaundice as such, since it's not a disease but a sign of a medical problem. the approach is to treat the underlying cause, if possible. many, like hepatitis a, aren't curable but go away on their own. usually treatment is unnecessary. conditions like chronic hepatitis are lifelong problems that may cause permanent or recurring jaundice. hope i have answered your query. if you have any further questions i will be happy to help. thanks"

hello my mother is under chemo therapy and right after 4th round her blood pressure has been elevating . the gets in hydration twice a week and doctors recently put her on lisinopril ( 5mg ) once a day . yesterday they increased to 10 mg. just checked blood pressure and it is 153/93 . second time was 147/97 . an you tell me why is this happening ? is it the in hydration ?,1,38684,"hello, thank you for your query. i understand your concerns. for ideal blood glucose control the fasting blood glucose should be less than 110 mg/dl, the 2-hour post radial blood glucose should be less than 160-170 mg/do. i am not sure of your mothers age as these values are patients who are less than 55-60 years old and who are reasonably in good health. as a person becomes older or if there is a diabetic patient who has multiple problems, then these target values would also be a little higher than too tight control of an elderly persons blood glucose will cause them to have low blood glucose (hypoglycemia) and this can cause in serious complications. i am also not sure how often your mother is taking the glycimark m and the logo 0.2 mg. assuming your mother is less than 60 years old and that she is reasonably good health, if she is taking glycimark m 40/500 only once a day then it can be increased to twice a day (15 -30 min before breakfast and before dinner). if she is already taking this tablet twice a day, then she can increase the dose of this, she can take glycimark m 80/500 twice a day. recheck her blood glucose levels in 2 weeks. if her blood glucose is still high then she can take logo 0.2 mg either twice a day (if previously she has been taking it only once) or up to three times a day (if she has been taking it only twice a day). if at any point she experienced low blood glucose symptoms like sweating, hunger, dizziness, fast heart beat, mood changes etc., then it is the glycimark-m that is causing the symptoms, and she needs to reduce the dose of this. the immediate treatment of low blood glucose is by taking a tablespoon of honey/sugar, sugar candies, glass of fruit juice or regular pepsi/coke etc. this should be followed by a carboy chat doctor. her blood pressure is fine, and she needs to continue with her advance and cretan. i hope this answer has helped you. regards"

"by daughter is 12 months old and has had a viral infection for 2days now ... she started off vomiting and had a high fever ... i took her to the doctor the next morning and gave her lots of fluids and around the clock fever reducer .... her fever is pretty much gone , but she now has diarrhoea , and she wants eat or drink anything ... a have been trying to get her to drink anything at least once an hour ... all she wants to do is sleep ...",1,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

key doctor .. a have been trying to get pregnant by my husband for five years now an nothing has happen .. very time i go to my ob/gyn she says everything is fine .. pm only 24 an have been sexually active from the age of 18 yet nothing has happen ... ave been on an off of all the birth control you can think of but for the past 3 years i haven used any birth control at all,1,23404,"thanks for your question. it is important to realize that if you are sexually active, there is always the chance of pregnancy, even if you are using birth control. oral contraceptives are, in fact, 99% effective. they are so effective that if 100 women used a birth control pill as directed, only one of them would become pregnant in any given year. however, that is still 1 percent of women pregnant using a birth control pill as directed. birth control pill doses have gotten much lighter over the past twenty years, so formation of ovarian cysts is still possible. i did a study on this several years ago, showing that women may still form ovarian cysts on lighter dose birth control pills, although they usually do not ovulate. that is the mechanism for prevention of pregnancy. ovarian cysts can make hormones which may produce symptoms in women that mimic pregnancy. a pregnancy test for you is in order and your gynecologist may also recommend an ultrasound of the pelvis to detect any ovarian cyst formation. hormone production from the ovary may also produce the light spotting you are experiencing. remember, however, that any amount of bleeding on a birth control pill may signify a menstrual period. menstrual periods on birth control pills are chat doctor. i hope this answers your questions. i am available for further consultation if needed."

i pm having uncomfortable stomach pains and a am under the impression a am having stomach bleeding due to the use of various medications lately a have been using for my cold . now much do you actually have to consume in order to get stomach bleeding ? ) :,3,97433,"hi, after reviewing your question i assume you mean a positive breath test for h. pylori? i am sorry to hear the amount of discomfort that you've been through. this is how i would proceed to look at your case:1. your symptoms are very peculiar for peptic ulcer disease or gastritis. both are different ways of getting damage done to your stomach. an ulcer is like a crater which may or may not be prone to bleeding. gastritis is a bit like having multiple pinpoint sore spots, causing pain and discomfort. a positive breath test may mean that you have h. pylori infection. as uncomfortable as this is, it is usually very treatable. were you on many painkillers because of the spinal fusion? if yes, then they would certainly have contributed. 2. i don't think a mask has anything to do with this. a sterile nasogastric tube taken out of the bag is very unlikely to bring infection to the insides of the stomach. nasogastric tubes, however, do cause a bit of irritation in the stomach lining. while they could have a very small contribution, i doubt they have had a significant effect. 3. the problem at hand seems to be the h. pylori infection which is a bacterial infection of the stomach lining which causes wear and tear in the stomach. this bug is acquired by the orofacial route. what this means is that someone with h. pylori sheds the bacteria through their stools. sometimes, because of poor hand hygiene, they may pass it on to others, especially through food. the new victim ingests these bugs and in this way h. pylori finds a new home to infest. i don't think your husband having a breath test will add to anything if he does not have symptoms. 4. an unintentional weight loss may signify a gastric ulcer (in opposition to peptic ulcer)5. you may benefit from a look down into the stomach through gastrostomy. it will give a great deal of information. your weight loss is also an indication of getting you a ct scan of the abdomen to ensure that there is nothing dangerous in play. 6. treatment would include amoxicillin, azithromycin and an acid tablet such as omeprazole for a 10 to 14-day course. since these recommendations include a gastrostomy, you will eventually have to visit a physician or a gastroenterologist to have it done. gastroenterologists are also excellent at managing h. pylori infections, along with ulcers and gastritis."

"i , may a answer your health queries right now ? please type your query here ... i have been suffering from headaches for the past month or so and now have spots in my eyes and get very dizzy over the last week , my up has said my foliate levels were low in a recent blood test and has now repeated it what does this mean ?",1,104504,"hello, i would suggest you to completely relax and not worry about it. feeling dizzy and early fatigue on walking is a common symptom with anemia(low hemoglobin count). low hemoglobin count in blood decreases your capacity of red blood cells in your blood to carry oxygen, so your brain, muscles and other parts of the body has decreased oxygen supply, which manifests as dizziness and fatigue low platelet count causes bleeding (only if it is too low i.e. below 50,000) and hence anemia and fatigue. it doesn't cause dizziness and fatigue directly. as you said the doctor has already done your blood tests and they haven't suggested it, which makes it very unlikely for you to have leukemia. for your information the cells count in blood increases in leukemia, but they are immature. if you were my patient, i would have asked more about-for how much time you were experiencing these symptoms.- was it associated with nausea, vomiting(bloody or nonbloody)- for how much time you have the diarrhea and what is the frequency-have you notices any swollen nodes-have you got any bone aches?- have you noticed blood in stools and color of stools-cbc hope i have answered your question. if you still have any doubt, i am happy to help you with that. meanwhile, if you do not have clarifications you can close the discussion and rate the answer. wish you best of health!"

i . a be been on birth control for the past 5 years . a get my period at the same time every month for a while now . 2 days ago a mostly brown mucus discharge has been coming pretty heavily and a have slight cramps as well . a jut had my period last week . a have had unprotected sex . that a is the discharge from ? when will it stop ? help please ! nicole,1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

i went to get tested for a uni but my white blood cell count was really low and my rbc count was really high and they told me its either something wrong with my kidneys or something else . i was wondering if it could be due to pregnancy ? or an std ? i had unprotected sex,1,96183,"i'm female 22 yrs and i also have really dark circles under my eyes. i tried all the creams and gels at pharmacies and none of them worked. i was diagnosed with vitamin b12 deficiency which causes dark under eye circles. it took me years to get a diagnosis because physicians don't generally test b12 levels especially if your cbc counts are normal. i had lots of routine blood work done, and they all came back normal. a few months ago i was experiencing severe tingling (i had other symptoms too, but the tingling was most bothersome) so i told my new doctor to test me for absolutely everything that can cause it. my b12 level came back at 30 which is extremely low. the funny thing about it was that i took b12 vitamins all the time... so my body just wasn't absorbing them. you should also consider getting tested for celiac disease - if you have symptoms associated with it - because it deprives your body of important vitamins. i'm sure there are products or something out there that helps dark circles, but it won't help if you have an underlying condition."

a am experiencing pain from my left hip down to my calf ... a was walking and the pain started in my hip as a continued to walk the pain became worse and radiated down my leg ... a tried to lay down but the pain became worst ... went to the doctor had only an x-ray and they said they did not see anything ... a still can not walk what is going on,1,82669,"an infection in the bone and in foreign material in the bone is very serious. such infections can continue for months and cause damage to the bone and surrounding tissue. the foreign materials could break down and cause pain and other problems. the infection can go into the blood and cause sepsis. this is life-threatening. antibiotics should be started now and probably continued for several weeks if not months. it is possible he has had this infection cooking along in the bone for some time, and it is now just coming to the surface. this means it is now about to spread very quickly. this happened to my brother. his hip replacement became infected but didn't show any outside signs until he went into shock and was taken to hospital by ambulance. he was lucky to survive. keep trying to convince your friend to see the doctor. he will eventually end up there anyway and in much more serious condition if he waits. hope this helps."

(as if try to hold urine intermittently during voiding)6. penile squeeze technique applied at the point of ejaculatory inevitability.7. applying a local anesthetic ointment to glans penis prior to penetration. i recommend you to consult psychiatrist, who will guide you how to utilize all these techniques effectively best suited for you. wish you good health."

"key , a am 16 weeks pregnant and a was prescribed duphaston since a found out that a was pregnant due to pcos prior to pregnancy . the dose a am on is 2 tablets of 10mg a day . a just realized that a have forgotten to take my morning tablet . that shall a do ? shall a take two tablets or just forget about the missed dose ? will it have any negative effect on my pregnancy or baby ? thanks : )",1,12813,"hello, cerazette is a progesterone only pill. it is common to have an irregular period on this. the protection continues as long as one takes the forgotten pill within twelve hours of forgetting it. the chances of falling pregnant increase if there is a delay of more than twelve hours from when it was due to be taken. up to two tablets can be taken together if one misses on one day. however, missing 3 tablets puts one at risk of becoming pregnant. it is recommended that one uses emergency birth control measures in such a situation. you could repeat the pregnancy test two weeks after the test that you have taken and tested negative. or else do a blood test to check for pregnancy hormone level, if you are really worried. emergency contraception is the other course of action if you realize you have had unprotected intercourse. it could give you 95-99% protection of pregnancy if taken with 72 hours of unprotected sex. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further. regard,"

"a just started taking lisinopril 2 weeks ago . by gums started getting red , and now are inflamed and a have canker sores all over that side of my mouth . now , my jaw on that side is hurting , and my face is swollen . would it be the lisinopril causing it ? that is the only thing different that a have done .",1,98447,"hi, if the pain is exactly where the jaw joint is present or where the jaw connects then it is most probably due to disturbances in the jaw joint function only. if it started suddenly then it can be due to an injury or due to biting something very hard. it can also be due to sudden excess mouth opening or external trauma to the jaw joint. so my suggestion is to consult an oral surgeon or an oral physician and get evaluated. a panoramic x-ray can be done to rule out the exact cause of the symptoms and treatment can be done accordingly. for now, take painkillers like ibuprofen and muscle relaxant like chlorzoxazone. take soft meals and avoid excess mouth opening. massage the sides of the face in gentle round motion of fingertips. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"hi ... a was diagnosed with pcos four months back . starting date of my last menstrual period was on jan 28 , 2014 . by period is not yet due . today afternoon i had a home pregnancy test , but the result was negative . a could sense a mild pain in my lower abdomen for the past one week . would you please clear my doubt whether i am pregnant or not ?",1,72167,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. estimating your date of conception is only really possible for women who have a 28-day menstrual cycle. by convention, the computer programs that are used to calculate your due date are working from an assumption that a woman has a 28-day cycle, and that conception took place exactly 2 weeks after your last period. if your cycle is longer or shorter, your ovulation could have taken place on a different day than what is estimated. so really just depends on whether you were with your second partner during your fertile window, which really can start 7 to 10 days after the first day of your last menstrual period and continue until a week before your next menstrual period is due. so depending upon how close and timing your sexual encounter with your second partner was, will determine how likely it is for him to be the father. if the margin either way is only a matter of a few days, you really will need a dna test to accurately predict the paternity of your child. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

(please note that some episodes can last for 4-6 weeks until complete recovery). if you have shortness of breath in past years (even childhood), it would more favor diagnosis of asthma.3. i would like to mention here that most of the patients with asthma have normal chest x-rays. chest x-rays are not useful to diagnose or to rule out asthma. of course, chest x-rays are helpful to know if you have any other lung related conditions like pneumonia, etc.4. in general, i would also suggest you regular breathing exercises and avoidance of smokes/fumes/dusts to improve your lung capacity on long term basis. if you are routinely exposed to such environment, i would suggest you personal protection measures such as using face mask, etc. hope above suggestions will be helpful to you and will help you solve the confusions. should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at chat doctor. wish you the best of the health ahead. thank you & regards."

"i my ten month daughter was in settled and latin next to me in my bed , she fell asleep so i just went to turn off the light when she rolled and she fell office bed but hit the corner or my bedside table she cries for a long time but fell back asleep after cuddles , i notice she has a soft lump at the back off her her head and now in worried she is fast asleep but if i try to move her she does respond do i need to take her to the emergency room or see how she is the morning",1,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"i pm mecca be and my fiance are trying to conceive we have been trying for about 7 months now , in smoker of cigar and cigarettes and still no luck but i spotted 2 weeks straight last month and then had a period and now this month i had my period but in feeling really nauseous and when i smoke anything i get sick and when i eat i feel sick and i have constant headaches and my stomachs tight and i pee lot more than usual i think about being prev all the time now and its in my dreams i usually done dream bout it my sis thinks i am but every test i take is neg please help id wat to do",1,77227,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, i want to clarify, if you are virgin and have not had sexual intercourse or ejaculation directly in the opening of your vagina, your chance of pregnancy is really nonexistent. sperm die when exposed to air, so there is no way that you can become pregnant from sperm that ejaculated outside the vagina. furthermore, is very uncommon to find women who ovulate during their menstrual cycle. therefore, you were most likely not at the fertile time of your cycle when you and your boyfriend had genital contact. furthermore, irregular bleeding can be caused by travel, changes in weight, hormonal imbalances and stress, especially the stress of worrying about getting pregnant. just because your period was light this month does not mean that there was anything wrong. now omens menstrual cycle is exactly the same every month, and as long as you got a period at the usual time, there is no reason to suspect pregnancy if the bleeding was different in quality than what you usually see. so i think that it is fine to be reassured that you did not conceive from this encounter with your boyfriend. if you continue to have irregular menstrual cycles for more than three months, you may want to visit your local physician as some hormonal imbalances can cause these problems and should be tested for. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was reassuring. best wishes,"

"it feels like a have a lump or a ball in the middle of my upper chest . there is a bit of pressure there and a a a bit tight chested . while a can breath okay , a feel like a can to breath fully all the time and find myself sighing a lot . a also seem to be a little out of breath sometimes when doing things",1,15046,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. feeling short of breath is not unusual while you're pregnant because the hormones of pregnancy actually have a way of telling your brain to breathe faster. this is to ensure that your baby gets enough oxygen, because as your belly gets bigger your lungs are not able to expand as well. so many women feel the sensation of needing to catch their breath all the time when they breathe when they are in the third trimester. in addition, because you would have been on bed rest for so long, you probably are not in very good cardiovascular shape. another possible reason why you could be feeling short of breath is that there is a possibility that you are anemic. normally, as part of routine prenatal care we check your blood count as well is a test for gestational diabetes somewhere between 24 and 28 weeks. if you've not yet had this test, it might be a good idea to mention your symptoms to your doctor. of course, there can be some serious, dangerous things that can cause shortness of breath; like blood clots that spread to your lung, or fluid in the lungs and other pulmonary problems. if you experience any chest pain or severe shortness of breath or start developing a productive cough, you should notify your doctor immediately and possibly go to the hospital for evaluation. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

"a have a 13 year old daughter whom a started on birth control as a safety precaution , however she can not remember to take the pill regularly which is how a got pregnant with her at 17 . is she to young to get the arm birth control implant or is there a better alternative for her ?",1,97794,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. even though there is an expiration date on the implant, for medical safety and medications are devices that expire still have some function in them beyond the expiration date. so there is a very strong possibility that if you are not menstruating your implant is actually still providing contraception. furthermore, the side effects of the implant can be similar to pregnancy, as the hormone in the implant in certain ways tricks your body to thinking that your pregnant in order to provide contraception. so at this time, it is most likely the implant is still preventing pregnancy. eventually, the usual way you will find out that the implant has worn off is that your menstrual period will begin again. however, if you strongly do not desire pregnancy i suggest you use a backup method of contraception just in case. there is no reason to believe that you are infertile while you on birth control. until the birth control is completely out of your system, there is no way to know about whether you can conceive. if you are otherwise healthy and under the age of 35 and at regular menstrual cycles before you got the implant, there is no reason to suspect that you would have problems with fertility once the birth control is out of your system. the rod should be removed when you can, as the device was not tested for integrity in your arm much beyond the expiration date. in the united states, planned parenthood offers low-cost and free birth control management and would be a good place to investigate for removal of your implant at an affordable rate. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"
