"good evening doctor , by mother is having cute and severe pain on right side of the body extending to the back of the body . a got the ray report of the region done which says everything is normal . ultrasound report says a simple cortical cyst on pole of right kidney . kindly explain me the findings and give me the your possible diagnosis . than in anticipation dr. gnu",1,86459,hello saw your query on chat doctor...your ultrasound test report states the presence of cortical cyst in upper pole of right kidney which is less than 3 cm in size in diameter. presence of cortical cysts are usually seen as an incidental finding in many patients and i do mention these findings on daily basis and should not be worried as such. however a point of caution should be given when there are signs of complexities within the cyst if any which we call as complex cyst. this point has not been mentioned by you whether it is a simple cyst or complex cyst. it should have been stated by your radiologist. if it read a simple cortical cyst then according to me there is no reason to worry. simple cortical cysts usually do not cause any pain and hence do not explain your problem of lower abdominal pain as such. get yourself clinically evaluated by your local physician for diagnosing proper cause of the pain. thank you and i hope your query is answered...if you have any more query you can contact us.

"hello , a have a question regarding herpes . by partner and a found out that he has herpes virus but no symptoms for the past ten years . the question is a have no symptoms and we have two children together with no symptoms either . is their any possibility that we could be infected or carrying the virus ? now can we be sure ?",1,45075,"hello, short answer: yes, you could have herpes. detailed answer: if your partner has herpes then it is very probable that he has transmitted it to you. herpes virus is very contagious and since you have had unprotected sex then it is highly likely for you to have got it as well. transmission can occur, even the context of intact and healthy looking skin and genital mucosa, and absence of symptoms. transmission can occur through any kind of contact with the infected person: anal, sexual, fingering, oral sex. you might be completely asymptomatic during your entire life or signs and symptoms could come and go from time to time, and this is different from one individual to another. however, please note that herpes virus is the most common virus among human populations. it has no cure, but some antivirals might help to lessen symptoms. there is no universal protection from it. even condoms protect only in about one third of cases as it depends on how it is used (if hand is contaminated then the condom cannot stop the infection). the final suggestion: if you have got it, get used to it and life goes on. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"i , i a a 60 or old male . i a in fairly good health , my main problem is high blood pressure that a controlled by medication . by current symptoms ( continuous headache , brainfog , fatigue ) seem to point to non-celiac gluten sensitivity but i don to have any intestinal problems . that else could be causing these symptoms ? paul bergman",1,111073,"hi ! good evening. i am chat doctor answering your query. the first advice from me to you is to stop eating from outside completely if you do specially the fried, oily and fast food. this might be causing recurrent intestinal infection because of poor cooking hygiene. apart from the hygiene, some food components specially in the fast food from outside may induce sensitivity to the intestinal mucosa, leading to all your symptoms which you just described. this sensitivity could be due to anything like a lactose sensitivity, and gluten sensitivity, the incidence of these disorders being underestimated in most of the places. once intestinal infection is excluded, sensitivity to a particular component of the food can be diagnosed by gradual exclusion of that particular component from your diet. this can be well controlled by a qualified dietician and the moment that particular component is excluded, the person start feeling far better.thus, the treatment varies from one to the other. there has to be a high index of suspicion of these not very uncommon pathology. i hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts. thanks for choosing chat doctor to clear doubts on your health problems. wishing you an early recovery. chat doctor."

a hyperextended my knee 5 days ago . it has been swollen very bad the past few days . last night my big toe started hurting with extreme pain and still hurts this morning . by foot is also swollen . any suggestions before a go to the emergency room . thank you,1,13930,"hello, and thank you for your question. fortunately, you probably do not have fibromyalgia. there are several possible causes of pain just in the toe. if there is a pinched nerve in the lower spine, it can cause pain that can be just in one toe. if this is the case, you may find that the pain is worse with change in position, such as lying flat or standing up. pain in the toe, typically the big toe, is common in a disorder called gout, in which the body has too much uric acid. the pain usually lasts a few days at a time, and is usually associated with redness and swelling. pain in the toes can be caused by corns or other skin problems that look small but feel very severe. pins and needles, shooting, on-and-off pains can be caused by irritation to a nerve by diabetes, by lack of vitamins such as b12, or by pressure - similar to the ""foot falling asleep"" feeling we sometimes get if we cross our legs too long. fibromyalgia, on the other hand, is usually a ""pain all over"" problem - back pain, neck pain, arm pain, knee pain, without another cause such as arthritis. it usually does not cause just one part of the body to hurt - most patients say that ""everything hurts"". in my practice, i start with finding out as much as i can from the patient about how the pain feels and how long it has been going on, and if it seems related to anything else. then we examine the foot to look for anything going on with the skin, check if the nerves of the foot are normally sensitive, not as sensitive as usual, or more sensitive, and then we may check blood tests to detect diabetes or vitamin deficiency or other problems as needed. fibromyalgia is diagnosed by obtaining a careful history of where the patient is having pain, other medical problems, and completing a physical exam including what is called a ""painful point"" exam where the doctor pushes at certain places in the body - on the back and near the joints - to see if this causes pain. i hope that my answer to your question is helpful. if you have any further questions, please check back with us. i hope your toe is much better soon."

a am approx 5 weeks pregnant from my lmp and a had a vaginal ultrasound which show just a gestation sac which measured 7.5mm but nothing else and the or said this shows around a 4 week pregnancy so either a am earlier than calculated or it has stopped . by chatdoctor levels were 7500 or so . that do you think/ should a be worried ?,1,35387,"hallow dear, due date of delivery is calculated as 9 months and 7 days from the last menstrual period date. you had intercourse on january 10 meaning thereby that the egg release and conception has taken place on 10 january. thus, if you had your conception around january 10, your probable date of menstruation would be 14 - 16 days prior to that as the egg release takes place 14 days prior to the next menses. so let me presume that your menses were on 26 december. then in that case, the due date would be 2 october. this day happens to be 26 december + 9 months + 7 days. 21 oct is projected by ultrasound. ultrasound measures the period of gestation as per the size of the baby and hence is supposed to be more accurate. it differs from the due date calculated by lmp by a week or so. i hope this clarifies the dilemma in your mind."

want decide to the out gallbladder having problems for four years but all test are negative hydrascan ultrasound etc i some see to drink no more can tolerate foods but not fried some dry want to remove gallbladder to see if it helps in on the fence i,1,77921,"most people who have gallstones do not have symptoms. if you have symptoms, you most likely will have mild pain in the pit of your stomach or in the upper right part of your belly. pain may spread to your right upper back or shoulder blade area. sometimes the pain is more severe. it may be steady, or it may come and go. or it may get worse when you eat. you may decide to go to the doctor because of pain in your belly. in this case, your doctor will ask you questions about when the pain started, where it is, and if it comes and goes or is always there. your doctor may order imaging tests. these take pictures of the inside of your body. an ultrasound of the belly is the best test to find gallstones. this test does not hurt. your ultrasound may not show gallstones. but if your doctor still thinks you have a problem with your gallbladder, he or she may order a gallbladder scan. in this test, a doctor injects dye into a vein in your arm. then a machine takes x-rays as the dye moves through your liver, bile duct, gallbladder, and intestine. if you do not have symptoms, you probably do not need treatment. if your first gallstone attack causes mild pain, your doctor may tell you to take pain medicine and wait to see if the pain goes away. you may never have another attack. waiting to see what happens usually will not cause problems. if you have a bad attack, or if you have a second attack, you may want to have your gallbladder removed. a second attack means you are more likely to have future attacks. many people have their gallbladders removed, and the surgery usually goes well. doctors most often use laparoscopic surgery. for this, your surgeon will make small cuts in your belly and remove your gallbladder. you will probably be able to go back to work or your normal routine in a week or two, but it may take longer for some people. sometimes the surgeon will have to make a larger cut to remove the gallbladder. it will take longer for you to recover from this type of surgery. regards and take care"

i a was put under for gall bladder surgery it has been approximately twelve hours and i am extremely itchy is this common or am a having an allergic reaction .,1,49493,"hi, how are you? i am so sorry to hear about your symptoms. stones in the gall bladder are a fairly common finding during usg of the abdomen. you do not need any additional tests to confirm the presence of gall stones. but not all gall stones need treatment. in most cases the stones do not cause any symptoms to the patient. this is especially true if there is a single stone. in some cases, when there is a small stone, it can spontaneously get expelled from the gall bladder. this is usually accompanied by pain and occasionally jaundice. the main danger of gall stones is when the stone blocks any of the ducts (tubes) chat doctor. this scenario is more common when the stone is small enough to pass through the gall bladder opening but for some reason gets stuck in the bile duct. this will need a ercp to extract the stone. this is much more common when the gall bladder has multiple small stones. in 99% of the cases, the treatment is accomplished by ""laparoscopic cholecystectomy"" (removal of gall bladder by making 3 small cuts on the abdomen, guiding the surgery through a small camera inserted). this is a fairly routine surgery and could be done at most hospitals safely. unfortunately there are no medical therapies available once the stones have already formed. also laser therapy for stones have been utilized in kidney stones and not in gall bladder stones and hence has no role. in your case, (as i understand) there are multiple small stones. since you are getting symptoms of pain, i would suggest getting the gall bladder removed at the earliest. hope this helps, and please do not hesitate to contact me for more details - rxsuresh@gmail.com"
i a was put under for gall bladder surgery it has been approximately twelve hours and i am extremely itchy is this common or am a having an allergic reaction .,2,101647,"hi, how are you? my name is chat doctor. i am a liver and pancreas specialist and i hope to answer your question today. i am sorry to hear about your mothers condition. gall bladders tend to become thick walled and shrunken in patients who have repeated bouts of inflammation (cholecystitis). this will make it very difficult for the surgeon to remove, especially by laparoscopic (keyhole) technique. the normal procedure in such cases would be to do an open cholecystectomy, which involves making a 7-10 cm incision on the abdomen and then removing the gall bladder under vision. the dangers of leaving behind the gall bladder depends on what the original reason for the surgery was. leaving behind the gall bladder due to stone disease will put the patient at risk for further attacks of cholecystitis, but a still worrisome reason would be if any cancer occurs in the gb which would mandate that an open cholecystectomy be done. in summary, i would advise you to consider an open cholecystectomy to avoid future complications. hope this helps and hope your mother starts to feel better. please do not hesitate to contact me for further details rxsuresh@gmail.com. have a great day"
i a was put under for gall bladder surgery it has been approximately twelve hours and i am extremely itchy is this common or am a having an allergic reaction .,3,94669,"welcome to chat doctor ! gall bladder surgeries are one of the most commonly performed surgeries these days, even on youngsters. it is usually done after ultrasound and blood tests which can tell in advance in most of the cases if there is an active infection going on. however, in my experience i have seen cases in which it is only during surgery case becomes clear enough. the condition which you have mentioned is one of acutely inflamed gall bladder, which is first tried with laparoscopy but because found difficult to access was later tried with open surgery. when the gall bladder is found acutely inflamed during surgery and especially if it is stuck to either liver or any other organ, it is usually not operated on. so, i think that your doctor has done the right thing. such cases are preferably given time for few weeks to months for acute infection to settle down, under antibiotics and vigilance. they are later operated on after repeat investigations. please maintain dietary restrictions and take the prescribed medicines, and it will help you. because your gall bladder is already stuck between liver and stomach, it is possibly have shrunk and has less possibility of getting ruptured. regular supervision in between will keep you informed about the status of your gall bladder. keep in touch with your doctor. i can understand that it is difficult to undergo repeat surgery or wait for it, but in my experience i have seen such cases, and they had successful outcome. i hope this will help you, and feel free to ask further if you have any other question in mind regarding this."

"pm a 16 year old female . of been experiencing occasional sharp pain in my chest and often get the feeling a cant breath properly for up to 4 seconds , where a feel as if there no oxygen , a have had an asia test and an ecg however mother came back as us usual",1,93607,"hi! yes, it is possible that a normal ecg is followed by an abnormal stress test. the ecg done when the person is at rest, does not always show the problem of coronary heart disease. this is because while resting, the heart gets the amount of blood and oxygen that it needs to work. that is why, when there has been a typical chest pain and the ecg at rest was normal, the doctor recommends a stress test-ecg. during this stress, the heart job increases and the amount of blood and oxygen that it needs are doubled. in a healthy person, the heart work and the amount of blood and oxygen that it needs are in balance, while in coronary heart disease they are disbalance (stress test shows abnormalities). i tried to explain why it can happen to have a normal ecg and an abnormal stress test-ecg. i hope to have been clear enough for you. i wish your father gets better soon! thanks for sharing your concern with us! all the best,"

a am 2mth and half post party a nearly exclusively breastfeeding and on microbus a had one intercourse since delivery on 3-10-14 and the second and third day after intercourse a had cramping on my abdomen and my back after one week a had very mild spotting a have no period since delivery a am afraid to be pregnant a do pregnancy test today the result was extremely faint in complete test line a should put your eyes very close to test window to see it a have no pregnancy symptoms like last pregnancy a don to know the interpretation,1,35396,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. if you have not yet missed your period, even if you are pregnant, the line will appear very faint on the pregnancy test as your hormone levels are extremely low at this time in pregnancy. so there is no reason to assume that the test was wrong as the greatest likelihood is that you are actually pregnant. however, women can have a situation where they have a positive pregnancy test and then get their normal period on time. this is known as a chemical pregnancy and is caused by the situation where the egg is fertilized but never implants into the uterus and continues to grow. so i encourage patients in general to try to avoid performing pregnancy test before they actually miss their period, as even though you have a positive pregnancy test this early, it does not guarantee that the pregnancy is going to take. if your cycle is late, there is no reason to assume that there is any problem with the pregnancy. if you do retest after you miss your period and the line is still very weekly positive, it may be reasonable to see a physician and get a blood test for the level of your pregnancy hormone. pregnancy hormone levels are supposed to double every 48 hours so by the time you miss your period the levels should be significantly high enough to produce a clear double line on the pregnancy test especially if you perform it with your first morning urine as recommended. low hormone levels in early pregnancy can indicate that the pregnancy is not developing properly or that it can be an ectopic or tubal pregnancy, which needs to be diagnosed and accurately managed by a physician. in the meantime however, i encourage you to stop chat doctor. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes and good luck with the pregnancy,"

hi ........................ this is regarding my mother she is 58 yrs old having diabetes since last 6 yrs she is on insulin from last 3 yrs.inthe starting sugar levels were high now its ups and downs up in the morning and down in the evening.its related with depression she is having total control on diet.she is chronic patient of depression,1,687,"hello and i hope i can help you today. insulin is used to treat diabetes during pregnancy at all stages and is safe and effective. the disease of diabetes and high blood sugar is the part that is dangerous for the baby, and good glucose control is the best way to ensure a healthy child. good blood glucose levels should be less that 95 for fasting levels and less than 120 after meals (2 hours). if this is the way your wife checks her sugar, and you test at least 4 times daily, she is under very good control and should not need further adjustment of her insulin if her levels stay at the current level. she should be checking her sugar fasting and then 2 hours after every meal. so in summary, insulin is safe and absolutely necessary for the health of the baby if your wife has diabetes. please discuss the dosing regimen with your treating physician on a regular basis and make sure your wife checks her readings at least when she wakes up in the morning and then 2 hours after every meal. she should also write down what she eats, so her doctor can also know if any changes need to be made in the diet. i hope this information was helpful and answered your question adequately. best wishes to you and your wife for the rest of the pregnancy. sincerely,"

hello or by 1st question is a got married in february 2014 .and trying to conceive baby from october .... my periods getting late 10 days every month from march . a a so worry about it a confused why it is happening with me from 4 months by 2nd question now can a conceived baby ?,1,12366,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, i want to reassure you that it commonly can take up to a year from healthy couples to conceive. you are not diagnosed as infertile unless you and your husband have been trying to conceive (which means having unprotected intercourse at least two or three days a week) for at least a year. folic acid is a b vitamin that does not help you to get pregnant, however it is recommended to take during early pregnancy because it helps prevent birth defects. siphene, also known as camphene citrate, is a fertility medication. it can help induce ovulation in women who are infertile because they do not ovulate. however, if your periods normally come every month, there is no reason to suspect that you are not ovulating. because you are under the age of 35, i recommend that you and your husband to not take any more fertility medications and try to conceive for another six months on your own. normally, your most fertile time is between the time your period stops until you start to feel premenstrual symptoms. for most couples, that means having sex every other day from about the seventh day of your cycle until the 23rd to 25th day. if you and your husband have not conceived in another six months, i recommend both of you see fertility specialist, as 50% of the time lack of pregnancy can be a problem with the men sperm as well. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful, and you and your husband are able to have a baby soon. best wishes,"

(regular use of emergency pill is harmful)conception occurs if she was in 10th to 18th day of her cycle(in a regular cycle of 28 day duration). you can ask her at what day she is in and wait for next cycle to occur. if it delayed by 7 days then get done upt to diagnose if pregnant and then the required treatment can be taken. regards"

(as you said he has difficulty in walking now). you can also say to his parents that --- they can continue with all religious customs along with medicines, may be then they will agree... with medicine, he will start showing improvement in few days only... it is psychosis and patients will not agree to go to any doctor willingly, so you might need to take him forcefully. this is well accepted as it is for his benefit only. even if he doesn't agree for oral medicine there are injectables which are given to such patients... take the right step, take him to a doctor. hope the reply is useful feel free to ask more questions"

"i , i am on cerazette and i have plasma . the of advised to remain on cerazette but i am noticing an increase in skin pigmentation around my face . that a your advice ? a have tried other pills and they seem to worsen the condition too . should i stop taking cerazette ? thanks",1,12376,"hellothanks for the query. actually, partial breastfeeding might cause absence of periods, but it does not guarantee that you would not ovulate. plus, taking cigarette 24 hours after unprotected intercourse does not protect against pregnancy. cerazette has to be taken regularly daily, and then too for the first month, a backup method of family planning is always advised. instead, you could have tried taking the emergency contraceptive pill. anyways, for the time being, you can use a barrier method (condom etc.) , and get yourself checked by a gynecologist after 3 weeks for any possible pregnancy. just one act of unprotected intercourse, that to while breastfeeding, puts you at low risk of pregnancy. once you have your check-up, you can ask her to prescribe proper contraceptive pills for you, after assessing you. take care."

"last normal period started august 31st . when noticed lighter red bleeding 8 days earlier than was intended in september on the 23rd and then in october on the 19th , the same thing happened and in november on the 15th , the same thing again .. all lasting only a few days .. my duration runs 5-7 days and these were 2-3 days .. there has been tenderness in the breasts , heaviness in the abdomen , irritability , moodiness and crying a lot and recently ( last couple of weeks ) some light fluttering on my right side .. took 1 pregnancy test that came up negative .. then took 2 a little more than a week later that came up positive .. a am wanting to know from when should a calculate by to figure out the due date being that a had this happen .. a was told they go by your last normal period . a have been looking for answers and there just does to seem to be a straight forward one ..",1,72620,"hallow dear, the duration of pregnancy when counted from the last menstrual period is 280 days or 9 calendar months and 7 days. in fact the egg is released (ovulation) 14 days prior to the next expected menses; i.e. if the cycle is of 30 days the egg will be released on day 16 of the cycle. the egg has 24 hours life while the sperms are active for 72 hours. hence, the conception can happen about a week around the day of ovulation. considering this, for practical purpose we consider 2 weeks less from the day of ovulation (or conception). so the pregnancy precisely is of 266 days. however, for the sake of convenience, we calculate it as 280 days from the last menstrual period date. considering these facts, if the delivery date is to be expected on september 30, the last menstrual period date should be 23 december. (would you be having it then?) now your cycle is of 30 days period. so the expected date of ovulation should be 07 january. hence, if the conception takes place on 07 january, the due date of delivery would be 30 september. the hitch here is that you should have ovulation taking lace on 07 january. moreover, we have noticed that all the pregnancies do not last for 280 days. the delivery can take place any time between 3 weeks earlier to 1 week later than the expected due date of delivery. keeping these facts and calculations in mind, you may plan your sexual relations accordingly. i hope this will help you."

(it is seen very commonly in clinical practice).second: rapid is not a chat doctor. your mother should revive something like~ sertraline/ escitalopram etc.third-the regurgitation appears to be due to reflux, which is most probably related to steroid use and not rapid. rapid does not cause this thing commonly. however, another possibility can be because of depression/ anxiety. so, i would sincerely advise you should talk to a psychiatrist in detail about your mother. hope the reply is useful please feel free to ask more questions"

"when my husband gets an erection sometimes just above the shaft he starts to bleed , as if has burst a blood vessel or something . when his penis shrinks it is difficult to see where the blood comes from . be was circumcised when he was young and he is now 56 . any suggestions what this could be ?",1,95688,"hello, im very sorry to hear about your friends stroke. here is some information relation to hemorrhagic strokes (brain bleeds).first, brain bleeds can happen for different reasons such as a head injury (traumatic), a rupture of an aneurysm and bleed within the brain matter itself (parenchymal hemorrhage). it is very important in your friends' case to determine what caused his bleed. given his fevers any infections need to be ruled out and an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) should be done to rule out any sort of infection of the heart valves which could send bacteria to the brain which could result in a bleed. he absolutely needs to have blood vessel imaging in the form of either a ct angiogram and mr angiogram to make sure that there are no abnormal collections of blood vessels in the brain and aneurysms that could have cause the bleed. also, when there is a bleed in the brain a tumor must also be ruled out. all that being said, the most common cause of a bleed in the brain is due to high blood pressure which causes weakening of blood vessels and can result in a hemorrhage. most commonly management of brain hemorrhages is supportive, meaning that the only things that are done is blood pressure control, pain management and if the person is unconscious then support for breathing. if the bleed is very large then surgical intervention may be necessary. what the doctors are saying as that they want to repeat a ct scan to see if the bleed has become larger, which can sometimes happen. there are several risk factors for the bleed worsening: one is poor blood pressure control, another is if there is an underlying aneurysm or blood vessel that could bleed. that's why it is so important to determine what caused the bleed. for small bleeds with no underlying vascular or malignant pathology the outcome is typically fairly good. the blood causes irritation and pressure on the surrounding brain causing weakness and neurological symptoms, but as the blood subsides the symptoms improve and sometimes there may be a remarkable improvement. the language area of the brain is very delicate, and it is hard to predict how well he will recover, but my best educated guess is that he will recover at least some language function and could even recover close to how he was though probably never quite back to level his language was before the bleed. it sounds like he is doing relatively well overall since he is able to go to the restroom without support, so that is an encouraging sign. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"yesterday a started to have stomach cramps in my lower admin .. it radiates from the right side to the middle . the symptoms are better when laying down , but get worse when standing or walking . a also started my period , but have never had any problems with menstrual cramps prior . a am not sure if it will pass or if a should seek out a doctor as soon as possible . it is also tender to the touch , hurts more when a laugh or drive over bumpy roads . thank you for your time .",1,91109,". i read your question carefully, and i understand your concern. from the information you gave, the first thing i suspect is muscle strain. the suspicion for this condition is even higher after you have done examination, even a ct scan. regarding the amoxicillin therapy, it is an antibiotic and i can't find a reason for taking that, but for sure the doctor that prescribed it had a reason for that. i do have some questions though. is the pain localized in you abdomen or between the lower ribs in your right side. the pain is steady, or it begins or worsens with movement? do you have any swelling or bruising? is it tender when you touch it? if it is more localized between your ribs, it gets worse with movements or sneezing or deep breathing, it might be tender when you touch it than probably it is just muscle strain (as i said you excluded major conditions with examination. besides this, the condition how it started (stretching too much to get something) and an acute onset, all lead to muscle strain. in general, muscle sprain can be treated with rice therapy - rest, ice application, compress and exercise. to alleviate the pain you could take pain medication like ibuprofen or naproxen. it is necessary to limit the movement of the torso (rest, but just the firs days). gentle stretching exercises can help strengthen the muscles. pain can be alleviated applying an ice pack for 15-20 minutes 2-3 times a day (ice should not be in direct contact with the skin). for a full recovery it can take 4-6 weeks. feel free for additional questions. i hope the answer helped you. best regards"

i am having chest pain regularly since one and half years . one ecg is normal echo shows mild mitral valve prolapse and stress test was 100 per cent . now there is tightness in neck and pain in shoulders and upper left and right chest . i am 42 years old . what should i do .,1,34243,"dear, first, please understand that pulmonary stenosis is basically the tightness of one of the valves on the right side of the heart and in your daughters case, it seems to be by birth. you have mentioned that she underwent cardiac cat hat the age of 1, but you did not mention that only the path study was done and what was the gradient at that time or the ballooning was also done. now she is 7 years old, and she never had any symptoms as per you (i presume she never had palpitations, loss of consciousness, chest pain, swelling feet or face, easy navigability), so i would just do echo to look for the gradient across the pulmonary valve and then decide if the cardiac cat his required or not. now coming to your worry about the leakage in the valve. a tight valve is rigid and it doesn't close properly sometimes leading to leakage which can sometimes become worrisome and needs surgery. and ballooning of the tight valve can also lead to some leakage in the valve and this ballooning is done only if there is no leakage initially. i hope i have cleared your queries to some extent!! all the best"

"hello madam/sir , i am feeling mild chest pain in the left side of my chest area and also sometimes spreads to left arm .. this is happening since last 10 -12 days .. though it is not continuously by happens after some time interval .. could a ply suggest me something",1,28983,"hello. thank you for your question and welcome to chat doctor. i carefully read your query. first, i believe that you know what does a chest pain originated from coronary arteries feel like. this is called angina, and is more like a severe heaviness or tightness in the mid-chest and which spreads to the left arm. sharp pain with the highest probability does not reflect a pain originated from a blockage in the coronary arteries. on the stent side, since it has been seven years you underwent stent implantation, i assume that the stents are patent and working well, since the highest probability for them to narrow is within 6 to 12 months after implantation, depending on from the stent placed. however, once you had coronary artery disease, although treated at that time, you have an independent risk factor to develop coronary artery disease again. i would recommend you to undergo a cardiac stress test, based on the above-mentioned fact, and the strain you felt in your heart area. as for the sharp pain in your left arm, my opinion is that it is not connected to coronary arteries. i hope i was of help. kind regards."

"hello madam/sir , i am feeling mild chest pain in the left side of my chest area and also sometimes spreads to left arm .. this is happening since last 10 -12 days .. though it is not continuously by happens after some time interval .. could a ply suggest me something",3,41649,"hello. thank you for your question and welcome to chat doctor. i understand your concern. well, i am going to try and explain the differences between various origins of the pain which can arise from the rib cage. there is angina. it is described more like mid-chest heaviness or squeezing sensation, that is triggered by exercise and relieved by rest, which radiates to the both sides of the chest, to the jaw and left arm and shoulder. it is indicative of a blockage within one or more coronary arteries and reflects the lowering of blood supply to the heart muscle. an ekg obtained in the moment of chest pain, if it fills this description, would be helpful. then there is pleuritic chest pain. this kind of pain is sharp, stabbing pain that can happen in any part of the chest area. no radiation like in anginal pain. it arises from acute or chronic inflammation of the linings that are within the rib cage: pleura (lining of the lungs) or pericardium (lining of the heart) or both. in this regard, i would recommend a chest x-ray for pleural inflammation or effusion. in case of pericardial pain and anginal pain, echocardiogram is helpful, by evaluating the size, motility and function of heart muscle and valves, and also by assessing the pericardium and whether there is fluid build-up within it, or not. other causes of chest pain are related to the locomotion system of the rib cage: muscle soreness, bone and cartilage-related pain. in the end, stress can also cause chest pain. i hope i was helpful with my answer. best regards,"
hi my mother is 52 years old and her ultrasound result is her right kidney has a smaller size than the left and the finding in the right kidney is increase cortical ecogenicity and possibility of right renal artery estenosis.what was that mean ? thanks a lot,1,4198,"hellothanks for query. your 52 years old mother has been detected to have stone of a size of 40 mm in her right kidney. considering the size of the stone being 4 cm in size extra corporeal shock wave lithography (esl) is not possible in her case. the only best treatment option for her is to get the stone fragmented and removed by a procedure called per cutaneous nephron lithotomy (pcnl). this surgery is done by a well-trained qualified urologist under spinal anesthesia, and she has to be hospitalized for 3 days. diabetes and hypertension that she has will be taken cared of by a team of physicians. chat doctor."
hi my mother is 52 years old and her ultrasound result is her right kidney has a smaller size than the left and the finding in the right kidney is increase cortical ecogenicity and possibility of right renal artery estenosis.what was that mean ? thanks a lot,2,7388,"hi, thank you for your query. the renal cortex is the outer portion of the kidney between the renal capsule and the renal medulla. it forms a continuous smooth outer zone in the adult which extends down between the pyramids. it contains the renal corpuscles and the renal tubules except for parts of the loop of hence which descend into the renal medulla. furthermore, it also contains blood vessels and cortical collecting ducts. the renal cortex is the part of the kidney where ultrafiltration occurs. now the thinning of renal cortex as in your case in the left kidney is due to a cyst(fluid filled swelling) which is exophytic (from outside).measuring 14 mm it is a big cyst which is causing compression of the cortex (outer zone) this leads to atrophy (loss of tissue). hence the size of the left kidney is smaller than the right one. hope the explanation answered all of your questions, thank you, wishing you good health"
hi my mother is 52 years old and her ultrasound result is her right kidney has a smaller size than the left and the finding in the right kidney is increase cortical ecogenicity and possibility of right renal artery estenosis.what was that mean ? thanks a lot,3,46414,"hi, thanks for writing in. a smaller right kidney with increase in cortical echogenicity can indicate decreased kidney function. for this the serum creatinine must be measured, and glomerular filtration rate is also assessed. disease in the right kidney might be in the initial stages. the most common cause of renal artery stenosis is a blockage in the arteries due to high cholesterol. this problem occurs when a sticky, fatty substance called plaque builds up on the inner lining of the arteries. when the arteries that carry blood to your kidneys become narrow, less blood flows to the kidneys. the kidneys mistakenly respond as if your blood pressure is low. as a result, they release hormones that tell the body to hold on to more salt and water. this causes your blood pressure to rise."

"hey my daughter has asthma .... its allergy aggravated ... has not acted up in at 18 months ... we live in the tropics by the way .... anyhow her prescott is was expired i threw it out .... bought her another one today , , , ,she is 8yrs old ... how much do i give her ?",2,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

pm overseas in france on vacationing and just noticed a lump on my daughters ( 7 ) front part of her next an inch or two above her collarbone . she is on an inhaler for bronchitis but no medicine other than that . at is it ? should she stop using her inhaler ?,1,42161,"hello. thank you for asking at chat doctor. i went through your daughters history and understand your concern about the medication which is not available at your place in kolkata. combitide star haler 125/25 contains two chat doctor. however, combative star haler 1 puff twice a day will give her total fluticasone 500 mcg and albuterol 50 mcg in a day. thus, she will not get dose of albuterol recommended by your doctor if she uses combative star haler 250. there are other similar inhalers containing fluticasone 125 and albuterol 25 which may be available in kolkata, but they may be manufactured by other companies. so, personally i would not suggest you to use combative star haler 250 in place of combative star haler 125/25 unless her treating doctor allows you. it will be the best option for you to ask her doctor regarding this. online purchasing her prescribed inhaler may be a good option if it is not available in your city. if it is not possible to contact her doctor in nellore or to wait till delivery (for online shopping), in my opinion, second-best option may be to give her inhaler with similar contents manufactured by other company till your next visit to nellore. hope above information will be helpful to you. should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at chat doctor. wish your daughter the best of the health. thank you & regards."

"hi there , over 5 months ago i had to take the morning pill through fear that my contraception pill haunt worked . i had sex on the 5th day of my period and took the emergency pill 13 hours later . since then i have had all periods , no morning sickness no cravings etc . however 13 weeks later i started feeling twitching in my tummy . i took a pregnancy test whicchatdoctore back negative . 6 weeks later i was still getting the twitching . took another test which was still negative . i am still getting the twitching feeling along with pain and bloating . i suffer from is but it has never felt like this before . as i have said i have not missed a period but have read that this can happen . i am a tiny us size 6 with no bump but am really worried . thanks in advance",1,99504,"hi, well the fact that she took a pill after having sex was a good idea, as it greatly reduces the chances of getting pregnant while having unprotected sex or on the breakage of a condom. now, you must understand this, even though your girlfriends period is generally regular there are times when it is irregular for everyone, which means she can have her period later or earlier than normal. the fact that the home pregnancy test has given a negative result 3 weeks in a row is a good thing and in all likelihood means that she isn't pregnant. but if you're still having doubts about the results you can go to a doctor and ask them to test your girlfriends blood, it is by far one of the most efficient and accurate tests around, but takes time, since you have to make an appointment and see a doctor. i hope this answered your question."

"a have coronary heart disease for many years and have been on stations all that time . recently my pcp took me off the stations , and now after three months a am having chest , left arm pain . an being off the stations be enough time for the cholesterol deposits to increase enough to cause this pain ?",1,28983,"hello. thank you for your question and welcome to chat doctor. i carefully read your query. first, i believe that you know what does a chest pain originated from coronary arteries feel like. this is called angina, and is more like a severe heaviness or tightness in the mid-chest and which spreads to the left arm. sharp pain with the highest probability does not reflect a pain originated from a blockage in the coronary arteries. on the stent side, since it has been seven years you underwent stent implantation, i assume that the stents are patent and working well, since the highest probability for them to narrow is within 6 to 12 months after implantation, depending on from the stent placed. however, once you had coronary artery disease, although treated at that time, you have an independent risk factor to develop coronary artery disease again. i would recommend you to undergo a cardiac stress test, based on the above-mentioned fact, and the strain you felt in your heart area. as for the sharp pain in your left arm, my opinion is that it is not connected to coronary arteries. i hope i was of help. kind regards."

"a have severe copy my last put was 28 percent but i am short of breath all the time even just walking around the house and light headed with chest pain , a do have history of chi because of the copy but my o2 says are always good , why is that and should i be concerned ?",1,15046,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. feeling short of breath is not unusual while you're pregnant because the hormones of pregnancy actually have a way of telling your brain to breathe faster. this is to ensure that your baby gets enough oxygen, because as your belly gets bigger your lungs are not able to expand as well. so many women feel the sensation of needing to catch their breath all the time when they breathe when they are in the third trimester. in addition, because you would have been on bed rest for so long, you probably are not in very good cardiovascular shape. another possible reason why you could be feeling short of breath is that there is a possibility that you are anemic. normally, as part of routine prenatal care we check your blood count as well is a test for gestational diabetes somewhere between 24 and 28 weeks. if you've not yet had this test, it might be a good idea to mention your symptoms to your doctor. of course, there can be some serious, dangerous things that can cause shortness of breath; like blood clots that spread to your lung, or fluid in the lungs and other pulmonary problems. if you experience any chest pain or severe shortness of breath or start developing a productive cough, you should notify your doctor immediately and possibly go to the hospital for evaluation. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

"break through bleeding : by girlfriend had taken the plan a will 2 weeks ago and got her period . everything was fine this week and last week ( when she was on her period ) and then today she told me that after working out she didst feel well and called me later on that there was blood mixed with discharge after going to the bathroom . the reason why she tool the plan a earlier was because there was contact between my penis and vagina , but there was no intercourse . a done understand whats going on here and a highly doubt that she can be pregnant . of you could offer some help/ advice as to whats going on , it would be greatly appreciated",1,103724,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. levonelle, which is one brand of the morning-after pill, is over 90% effective in preventing pregnancy if taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse. so if your girlfriend follow the instructions on the package and took the medication correctly there is a less than 10% chance that she will become pregnant.however, if her period is late, she should do a urine pregnancy test to make sure that everything is okay. it is not unusual for women to have some bleeding 2 to 3 days after taking the morning-after pill. this is not a real menstrual cycle, just evidence that the medication is working. her real cycle may be delayed as a side effect of the hormones in the medication. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was reassuring. best wishes and good luck,"

hi i am a 32 year old female . i am 126 ends . and am 5ft 2 in . i recently was told that i may be suffering from depression but i think it is more along the line of anxiety . i worry lot and can not seem to focus on daily activity . i also believe that i am a hypercodiac because i seem to find things wrong with myself when no one else can . i was prescribed helena but it gives me really bad headaches,1,58987,"his am chat doctor. i have read your message. i think i can help you. first, a package test means that multiple tests are included that correlate to the test. cpk and spe can both be package tests as there are many related tests needed in a diagnosis. the symptoms that you seem to be facing as per the query is basically severe backache that increases on lying down or bending-in other words, anything that causes the spine to be under pressure. now she itself can cause the symptoms. the muscles and bone problems can arise in she itself and thus possibly one will feel that there is nothing more to do. however, in many situations, the doctors may get biased my a diagnosis. so, i think it is good that your doctor did not get biased with your pre-existing diagnosis of she and continued to look for other causes of backache. a severe backache can happen due to muscle disorders, a condition known as myopathy. the cause of myopathy may be she itself. the test commonly done to test myopathy is cpk or creatine phospholipase. this is a test done from blood. the idea is if the cpk is raised, it suggests myopathy. in this situation, your doctor will need to modify the therapy. i am unaware of your medication from the query. so i cannot really comment upon it. but some medicines themselves cause myopathy. and sometimes, the dose of existing medicines need to be stepped up for treatment of myopathy. so i presume your doctor wanted to check that. second test was spe or serum protein electrophoresis. this is one of the tests for multiple myeloma. this is a type of malignancy that affects the bones and causes bone pains and should be ruled out in middle-aged to elderly commonly if the backache is worsening and is specially bad when lying down. if the test is negative, there is nothing to worry about. if it does come out to be positive, multiple myeloma can be treated. so again you need not worry since the treatment is available. why the doctor did not tell you about the tests is something i can only speculate about. i guess it was because these are just doubts, considering you already have she- in medicine, the usual dictum is that one disease can explain the symptom, the other condition should not be sought. having said that, it's a folly to miss another diagnosis due to a pre-existing condition. i think he would have told you if the tests came out positive. so there should be nothing to worry about-the doctor was just making sure that there is no other problem. possibly since there was nothing else diagnosed, he did not tell you about it. i have tried to make it as simple as possible to understand the situation. in case there are still doubts, feel free to contact me for further details. best of luck,"

i started my period on sunday so i also started taking birth control with this period . saturday i had unprotected sex . for the past two days i have been feeling extremely sick to my stomach and like i need to be in bed all day long . could this be because of my new birth control pills making me feel so bad or could i possibly be pregnant ?,1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"
i started my period on sunday so i also started taking birth control with this period . saturday i had unprotected sex . for the past two days i have been feeling extremely sick to my stomach and like i need to be in bed all day long . could this be because of my new birth control pills making me feel so bad or could i possibly be pregnant ?,2,33341,"hi, if you came to my clinic with those complaints i would ask you to stop worrying. many women that start using the pills for the first time experience similar problems. i understand that you have taken the inactive pills first and then started on the active pills. also, you have had intercourse only after your period was over that is about 11 days ago. the chances of pregnancy occurring after a single act of unprotected sexual intercourse are only 4%. also, for women that have regular periods the chance of getting pregnant is more if intercourse occurs after 11-12 days since the first day of the period. hence, the chances of getting pregnant are low if you have had contact before this period. you are also having a sick feeling in the stomach and most probably a cramp like feeling. this may be due to the pills as some females take time to get adjusted and may improve with continuous use and by taking the pills with food. the pills are not known to cause any major effect on the baby if they are inadvertently taken in early pregnancy. since you have started taking the active pills late, i would recommend that you use a backup contraceptive measure like condoms, for the next 7 days while you still take the pills to avoid pregnancy. i would be pleased to answer any further queries that you may have, enjoy a wonderful day."

"by father-inlaw finished throat cancer treatment a year ago this november . however , he can not produce saliva anymore , but when he is full from eating , his nose runs . be is convinced that somehow scar tissue is built up around his saliva glands and re-routing it through his nose . is this possible ? and can dry mouth be fixed surgically ?",1,25271,"hi thanks for the query it looks like an obstructed duct of submandibular salivary gland that is present under the jaw. swelling under the jaw that increases just after eating is clear indication of obstructed duct as when there is obstruction in the duct of the salivary gland due to formation of crystalline stones known as sialolithiasis from the minerals present in saliva the duct is blocked. when saliva flow increases suddenly when we start eating, and it cannot flow into the mouth there is back flow of saliva into the gland, and it swells. as the salivation gradually reduced and also some saliva seeps through narrow spaces left in the ducts there is reduced swelling. you should consult an oral physician and get evaluated, and he can do a thorough clinical evaluation, although as you are pregnant x-rays cannot be taken. if it is suspected to be due to stone formation you can be advised to suck tart candies as at times the stones can flush out with heavy saliva flow. superficial stones can however be pushed manually towards the duct orifice and can be removed. deeper stones need surgical removal and for this it will be better till you deliver the baby. hope this helps regards"

"hello , the first day of my last period was 30 march 2015 . a am 4 days late and haven to had any period pains . a get dizzy at work and my tummy is bloated without cramps . when can a take a pregnancy test ? to you think a a pregnant . a a not on any pills or injection . thanks",1,97148,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. if you are having unprotected intercourse without using any form of contraception, you are risk for pregnancy. pregnancy symptoms can vary widely between women, and symptoms of bloating, cramps, breast tenderness, mood changes, and irregular bleeding can be caused by hormonal irregularities as well as pregnancy. the most common sign of pregnancy however, is a late or missed menstrual period. so, i recommend that you purchase and perform a urine pregnancy test with your first morning urine according to the package directions. this will confirm whether you are pregnant. i hope that i was able to adequately answer question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

a first felt coccyx pain after pulling my achilles tendon ... if was on and off ... for the past 2 months unbearable pain ... had rays ... doctor told me to take motrin and sit on a donuts ... pain not relieved especially when putting donuts on couch ... starting therapy tomorrow ... am i going to have this forever read that if not taken care of asap it is a lifetime of pain,1,52955,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. in the first trimester of pregnancy, your ovaries produce the hormone progesterone which normally is made by the placenta once it reaches adequate size. so it is not unusual in the first trimester pregnancy to feel pain in your ovaries. in addition, as your uterus stretches, you also may experience some cramping and pulling sensations, which can be on the sides. the only thing that is concerning is if you have not had an ultrasound this pregnancy to confirm that it is normal and located in your uterus. if you already have had an ultrasound for this pregnancy it is unlikely that there could be anything harmful going on, especially if you are not bleeding. so if the pain is severe enough that you cannot function, especially if you have not yet had an ultrasound, if you cannot reach her doctor within a reasonable amount of time, you may want to pursue care in an emergency setting. if you have had a normal ultrasound earlier in this pregnancy, you really do not need to worry, as your ovaries are normally examined as part of your pregnancy ultrasound and a large cyst would've already been detected. tylenol, or acetaminophen is safe to use for pain at the normal adult dosage during all trimesters of pregnancy, and you can try to see if that helps with the pain. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

is it possible after the root canal fistula is appeared on the gum ? what is the reason behind it ? ? can you please tell me ?,1,100486,"hello, well, if it is not possible to get the wisdom tooth extracted, then treating infection is an option. however, it depends on what kind of infection you have, that means that is the infection present in the wisdom tooth in the form of decay or is it due to inflammation of the gum flap over the wisdom tooth. if it is due to decay in the wisdom tooth, then root canal treatment can be done if other conditions are stable and under control. if it is due to inflammation of the gum flap, then antibiotics and localized cleaning of the gum can help in the resolution of infection. so it is better to once consult an oral surgeon and get evaluated. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

is it possible after the root canal fistula is appeared on the gum ? what is the reason behind it ? ? can you please tell me ?,3,26004,"hello, thanks for your query. it sounds like you have a fistula. the fistula is the result of an abscessed tooth and a failed root canal. the abscess is an infection that first forms around the apex or tip of the root. if left untreated the infection will begin to erode the bone around the tooth. you are going to need root canal surgery called an apicoectomy in order to save this tooth. usually, a tooth that has undergone a root canal can last the rest of your life and never need further endodontic treatment. however, in a few cases, a tooth may fail to heal. the tooth may become painful or diseased months or even years after successful treatment. an apicoectomy is a way to save a tooth when inflammation or infection persists in the bony area around the end of your tooth after a root canal procedure. the endodontist will open the gum tissue near the tooth to see the underlying bone and to remove any inflamed or infected tissue. the very end of the root is also removed. a small filling may be placed to seal the end of the root canal and a few stitches are placed in the gum to help the tissue heal. the dentist will remove the bump or fistula and with a good result and a good immune system the tooth will heal, and the fistula will not return. i do hope that you have found something helpful, and i will be glad to answer any further query. take care"

"a have a growth on my upper inside right thigh . it is raised about the size of a nickle , but causes me no pain or discomfort . ave had it for a couple of years and its never bothered me , but a think it might be getting bigger , and its just weird . that is this and do a need to get it looked at",1,21962,"dear simone, there is one rule for doctors here in croatia: when you think too much, stop, and think again, but this time think for the simplest diagnose. if you have pain in abdomen and an umbilical hernia seen on us then the first thing to think about is ""abdominal pain caused by hernia"":). there are many conditions in medicine where pain doesn't need to beau localized near the ""pathology"". sometimes pain can be felt on the opposite side of the affected organ. it is known that one of common symptom of myocardial infarction is pain in the left shoulder. also, infection of the abdominal organs can give many types and localizations of pain. the reason for it is simple: when i see pain, i see nerves, not organs (this is my own phrase:)). nerves conduct pain, and nerves are all around, going from periphery to the brain, so pain can be localized on its pathway, so just let's go back to your problem. doctor should tell you the size of hernia and its content which can be only preperitoneal tissue, momentum or even intestines. this dark triangle...mmm.it can be nothing and everything. i usually don't trust our ultrasonographer because they are strange people... sometimes they don't see what they need to see, or they see what they don't need to see. all i see is that us is operator-dependent diagnostic test... but we shouldn't underestimate this finding. it can be uterine moma, endometriosis, cyst or tumor. and yes, it can cause pain you're describing. so what you need to do: 1. ct scan of pelvic and abdominal region. why? as i said, these us findings are always doubtful, ct is a high sensitive test which will find the exact problem for sure. it will tell you the size and severity of hernia and the morphology of this uterine lesion. it can also find some other problems in its early phase."

pm not sure what is happening with my foot . a had planters surgery about 6 weeks ago and am still in real pain . a done feel it so much in my heel anymore but am having a new problem that is just as painful . why are my foot knuckles popping in and out of place as a step down and then lift my foot back up again ?,1,44287,"thanks for your question on chat doctor. i can understand your situation and problem. in my opinion, it is callus or million of fracture. you had foot injury 3 weeks ago. and after 3 weeks, you are having bump on trauma site. so possibility of fracture at the time of trauma and healing after 3 weeks is high. in bone fracture, healing occurs by callus formation. it is collection of inflammatory cells and calcium which give rise to appearance of swelling. another possibility is million. if fractured fragments are not fused correctly then they can give rise to swelling due to million. so better to consult orthopedic doctor and get done clinical examination and x-ray of affected foot."
pm not sure what is happening with my foot . a had planters surgery about 6 weeks ago and am still in real pain . a done feel it so much in my heel anymore but am having a new problem that is just as painful . why are my foot knuckles popping in and out of place as a step down and then lift my foot back up again ?,2,13930,"hello, and thank you for your question. fortunately, you probably do not have fibromyalgia. there are several possible causes of pain just in the toe. if there is a pinched nerve in the lower spine, it can cause pain that can be just in one toe. if this is the case, you may find that the pain is worse with change in position, such as lying flat or standing up. pain in the toe, typically the big toe, is common in a disorder called gout, in which the body has too much uric acid. the pain usually lasts a few days at a time, and is usually associated with redness and swelling. pain in the toes can be caused by corns or other skin problems that look small but feel very severe. pins and needles, shooting, on-and-off pains can be caused by irritation to a nerve by diabetes, by lack of vitamins such as b12, or by pressure - similar to the ""foot falling asleep"" feeling we sometimes get if we cross our legs too long. fibromyalgia, on the other hand, is usually a ""pain all over"" problem - back pain, neck pain, arm pain, knee pain, without another cause such as arthritis. it usually does not cause just one part of the body to hurt - most patients say that ""everything hurts"". in my practice, i start with finding out as much as i can from the patient about how the pain feels and how long it has been going on, and if it seems related to anything else. then we examine the foot to look for anything going on with the skin, check if the nerves of the foot are normally sensitive, not as sensitive as usual, or more sensitive, and then we may check blood tests to detect diabetes or vitamin deficiency or other problems as needed. fibromyalgia is diagnosed by obtaining a careful history of where the patient is having pain, other medical problems, and completing a physical exam including what is called a ""painful point"" exam where the doctor pushes at certain places in the body - on the back and near the joints - to see if this causes pain. i hope that my answer to your question is helpful. if you have any further questions, please check back with us. i hope your toe is much better soon."

"hi my wife is 20weeks pregnant and today she had undergone ultra sound scan with doppler in the report they mentioned left kidney shows prominent partly extra renal pelvis measuring 3mm anteroposteriorly , otherwise both fetal kidneys show normal echotexture with no significant pelvicalyceal system dilatation what does it mean",1,34445,"hi, thanks for writing in. the collecting system of the kidney is made of renal calyxes and pelvis. this collects the urine formed in kidney and transports it through the ureter (tubes connecting kidneys and urinary bladder) to the urinary bladder. the pelvicalyceal system is the mouth of the kidney where it connects with the upper end of the ureter. i guess that you have got ultrasound scan done, and it shows mild fullness of the pelvicalyceal system in the left kidney, that is a term applied to increase in diameter of the collecting system in your left kidney. it is not a critical situation, and please do not worry if you do not have any urinary symptoms. since it is mentioned as mild fullness and no kidney stones have been found, therefore(i) it can be that your bladder was completely full at the of ultrasound scan(ii) your kidney pelvicalyceal system is appearing full by itself (extrarenal pelvis) and is an extension of normal appearance.(iii) rarely an infection of urinary system and kidneys (recent or old) can cause such a finding, but this is likely only if you have symptoms like pain in the region of kidney and problems like burning urination or discoloration of urine or any kidney infections in the past.(iv) stones in kidney or ureter can also cause fullness of pelvicalyceal system and since you do not have any stone therefore this does not apply to you. it is important to know if your scan was repeated after passing urine and still there was persistent mild fullness of the pelvicalyceal system on left side. this can also be confirmed by doing an mvp which is injecting a contrast and taking 5 to 6 x-rays to study the functioning of the kidneys in a better way. please consult the urologist."

"hello , my question is live been on my first pill pack ( birth control ) since sunday , and 4 days later i had unprotected sex with my of and he came in me , now in wondering if i need a plan a pill ? ? p.s i had my period for 2 months but the pills made them stop ( does that make a difference ? ) please help",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"a have a relation who has a 6cm tear in his aorta . operation is not an option due to his weight and religious stand to no blood . is only option at this stage is to get his blood pressure down and stable and allow it to heal itself and at a later time when he is stronger , insert a stent ? is this possible ?",1,46747,"hello, thanks for writing to chat doctor, i am chat doctor. the best option of treatment for an aortic tear, we call aortic dissection is to get a surgery done and remove that part of aorta which has a tear. along with that is very, very important to control his blood pressure to a maximum of 130 systolic, even below that. because blood pressure can cause tear to proceed further and cause more problems, even after surgery a high blood pressure causes risk of creating a new tear in the india of aorta. if religious standpoint does not allow surgery then there are very limited reliable options available, stenting has been tried, but result have been controversial. most cardiovascular interventionists prefer surgery, stents have their own problems, and they are usually ok for aortic narrowing but in a widened torn aorta they usually don't settle well and don't show good long term results. in this case scenario i would suggest that the patient should keep strict control over his blood pressure and can talk to a vascular surgeon who can do minimally invasive procedure, in this way a surgery with very little bloodshed will be possible, here i want to mention that even stenting will cause some bloodshed so for the sake of saving life this much will have to be discussed. in a nutshell, surgical repair is the best option, if the surgeon can do it with minimally invasive technique it will need much less blood loss. i hope this answered your question, if you have more queries i am happy to answer you. regards."

"a just finished my very first pack of minigynon 30 almost three days ago a my period haven started as yet . pm sure in not pregnant because during the past month i was not sexually active any at all ... however i want to start a next pack too .. now long before the pills will be effective and what if my period should start tomorrow , would it a of for me to still start the next pack or should i wait until after my bleeding",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"a took combiflam and amoxicillin a few minutes ago for toothache , a had it since last night along with a gene . two of my tooth are broken and has cavity for which the doctor has recommended either root canal or extraction last year . is it okay , as i had a little burning sensation in the nose .",1,89419,"hello, thank you for consulting with chat doctor. as you are mentioning that you had a root canal done of your tooth 2 months ago and after that you have noticed an abscess in the same tooth, it means that the root canal has not been done properly. actually root canal treatment resolves all source of infection and pain, and hence an abscess should not be encountered, but still if it is there then the infection is still present, but there is nothing to worry as a re treatment can be done. because the abscess can not go till you go for a re treatment or removal of tooth. hope it will help you."

clot has been occurred in brain . right side has been affected . speech has been lost . brain is working properly and recognising power is ok. 24 hours has been past . the patient was admitted immediately in the hospital . it the clot is recoverable through medicines and how much time it will take place .,1,73793,"hello, in order for accurate advice to be given more information would be needed, starting with patient sex and age, symptoms and current state, prior medical conditions, tests he's had to diagnose this clot and to determine its origin. it is such information which would allow an evaluation of whether everything has been done for him/her. speaking in general about brain damage due to a blood clot in the brain what your doctor has told you is correct. such brain damage is permanent. improvement is hoped when damage is not too extensive, but it is due to the undamaged brain compensating for the damaged cells, that process requires months, and it is usually a partial improvement not 100% of the previous state. it is not a question of medications, medication is prescribed mainly to prevent other clots with more severe consequences of happening in the future, little can be done for the cells permanently lost by the clot. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"hi , my partner has slipped disc and compressed on to his right leg nurse , he had an epidural injection into his spine on monday , but there is no different in his pain it looks like he is finding it difficult to walk now because of pain on his back , should we be worried and how long will it take to feel better",1,33169,hi there. it seems like your husband has aggravated an underlying disc problem which he might have been having for some time. sudden exercises can aggravate such problems if somebody is not used to it. for a patient having an acute pain i would initially recommend a period of bed rest for 3-4 days until the pain subsides. he can sleep with his hips and knees flexed that will reduce a bit of pressure on the nerve roots that are getting compressed. he can take diclofenac 100 mg to add to the initial pain relief and apply some topical analgesic ointments or sprays. during the period he can walk to the bathroom and walk around as tolerated. he would need to avoid sitting for a long time if possible. then once the pain subsides he can get back to his normal day-to-day activities. then he should build up his back muscle strength by doing extension exercises. and if he is on the heavier side he should do a bit of dieting and exercises that for losing weight that will help him in the long run. any exercise regime should be started with gradual increments in the repeats. ellipse is a demanding machine and one needs to increase their training gradually. thank you.

"hello , a am on the progesterone only pill and have been taking it for the past four months . a was taking my pill incorrectly for the first three months but since then discovered this took a pregnancy test which was negative and carried on but taking it correctly . all throughout this a have had on and off bleeding . and recently its been a light pink gooey colour ? a have had thrush before , however i had no symptoms it was a pelvic examination that discovered it . would this be another yeast infection or is this normal to have when taking the pill ?",1,77098,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. many women who have been on birth control for many years can develop a tolerance of sorts for the pills' ability to control your menstrual cycle, especially after they have not menstruated for a long time due to pregnancy or another cause. this can also occur to the fact that you did relatively recently give birth, especially if you were breastfeeding. bleeding when you are not supposed to have your period on the pill is called breakthrough bleeding. it does not mean the pill is ineffective as a contraceptive, but having some irregular bleeding in between periods or a different bleeding pattern that you may have had before the pregnancy is not unusual. having heavy bleeding in the morning is likely due to the blood accumulating in your vagina during the night, and then it all comes out at once when you get out of bed due to gravity. your cycle may get back to normal after a few more months on the pill, and taking it as close to the same time every day will help to reduce the risk of breakthrough bleeding. if it continues for more than 3 months, you may benefit from changing your birth control brand to one with a slightly higher dose of estrogen, as the estrogen in the pill is the ingredient that controls your menstrual cycle. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

i . about three weeks ago a had sex and the condom broke and he came inside me . a am on birth control and took plan a 2 hours after . a get my period on wednesday but a a having small cramping and this brown liquid like discharge is coming out . should a be worried about pregnancy ?,2,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

a have pain in the upper right arm for the last 6 hours . when a take two 81 my it goes away shortly but comes back . a did have to lift a few things after the pain started but not over 5 lbs . going to ice it when a get home . any other suggestions ... yyyy @ yyyy,1,77921,"most people who have gallstones do not have symptoms. if you have symptoms, you most likely will have mild pain in the pit of your stomach or in the upper right part of your belly. pain may spread to your right upper back or shoulder blade area. sometimes the pain is more severe. it may be steady, or it may come and go. or it may get worse when you eat. you may decide to go to the doctor because of pain in your belly. in this case, your doctor will ask you questions about when the pain started, where it is, and if it comes and goes or is always there. your doctor may order imaging tests. these take pictures of the inside of your body. an ultrasound of the belly is the best test to find gallstones. this test does not hurt. your ultrasound may not show gallstones. but if your doctor still thinks you have a problem with your gallbladder, he or she may order a gallbladder scan. in this test, a doctor injects dye into a vein in your arm. then a machine takes x-rays as the dye moves through your liver, bile duct, gallbladder, and intestine. if you do not have symptoms, you probably do not need treatment. if your first gallstone attack causes mild pain, your doctor may tell you to take pain medicine and wait to see if the pain goes away. you may never have another attack. waiting to see what happens usually will not cause problems. if you have a bad attack, or if you have a second attack, you may want to have your gallbladder removed. a second attack means you are more likely to have future attacks. many people have their gallbladders removed, and the surgery usually goes well. doctors most often use laparoscopic surgery. for this, your surgeon will make small cuts in your belly and remove your gallbladder. you will probably be able to go back to work or your normal routine in a week or two, but it may take longer for some people. sometimes the surgeon will have to make a larger cut to remove the gallbladder. it will take longer for you to recover from this type of surgery. regards and take care"

"a have an sexual intercourse last july 27 , and unfortunately , he didst know if he withdraw it on the right time .. be decided to in take a pill on aug 2 . a was expecting my menstruation 2nd week of august . but its already aug7 but still no menstruation yet . to i need to continue taking the pill to avoid to get pregnant ? is it effective to the the pill after sexual intercourse . thanks.hope for your reply",1,1599,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the morning after pill is 90 percent effective if taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse. so, regardless of what happened with your pill taking before your pill-free week, the morning-after pill should still be effective. many women have a delayed period after taking the morning-after pill as a side effect, but the possibility of pregnancy still exists if you are late, so you should perform a urine pregnancy test just in case. if it has not been 2 weeks yet since your unprotected encounter, it may be too early to have a positive pregnancy test, so i would repeat it in a week if that is the case. in addition, many women have an irregular period or skip entirely after they stop the pill. if you are not pregnant, you can start a new pack of pills as soon as you get them, but just use a condom as a backup for the first two weeks. you should get a period in the pill-free week as you did previously. i hope i was able to answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"a have been on the birth control pill , april , for 4 months now . a have not missed one day , and a always take them on time . by partner and a had sex while a was on my period . be did not pull out . a was also taking the drug cipro for a uti . this was about two weeks ago . should a be concerned about pregnancy ?",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"
