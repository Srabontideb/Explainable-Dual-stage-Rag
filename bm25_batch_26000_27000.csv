hi well in a 16 year old women . lately of been having shortness of breath and my heart flutters and a cant breath . a have trouble with it lot and pm wondering is something wrong ? of been to the of for a lot of rib and chest pains in the past . and it had went away for awhile but now its returning,1,18120,"welcome to chat doctor. i read your question carefully, and i understand your concern. i think that there is nothing wrong with you organically speaking. the way you describe your shortness of breath seems like you have an emotional stress (it's up to you to search in yourself about your emotional burdens). if there is something wrong with you, it would also appear during the night associated with other symptoms or signs. your initial question was causes of shortness of breath. there are many, which seems unlikely in your case. for example, people with cardiac diseases might have shortness of breath, but it occurs more often during the supine position or during physical effort and in general cannot be so active (you are a young girl, very active and symptoms alleviate during sleep). another cause is asthma, which is unrelated to standing or lying position (actually people suffering from asthma attacks tend to sit in the edge of the bed hungry for air). another cause might be respiratory tract infection, that is also unrelated to positions, and you would have other symptoms and signs, like cough, temperature etc. i recommend trying some relaxing techniques like listening to your favorite music, talking to a best friend, eating a proper diet, laughing a lot, exercising every day, sleeping better, taking deep breaths. avoid coffee and energy chat doctor."

"hello . a had a wisdom tooth removed last monday . all seems well , except for a very small , hard white bump on the inner gum area at the extraction site . its extremely hard , almost like a piece of tooth . pm wondering if its an abscess or some type of infection .",1,72577,"hi. welcome to chat doctor . i have gone through your query and can very well understand your health concerns. as per your complaint a small bump over the gums can be due to a few reasons:1. it can be gum abscess caused due to gum infection leading to pocket formation and abscess.2. it can also be a traumatic gum abscess caused by some trauma like with toothbrush bristles or hard food like hard chips etc.3. furthermore, it can also be a tooth abscess caused due to infection in tooth reaching below the tooth roots causing localizing of infection and pus leading to abscess formation. as you have a root canal treated tooth in that area it may or may not be a tooth related abscess, and you should consult a dentist and get an x-ray done to rule out the exact cause of the bump. in case of abscess caused due to infection antibiotics like amoxicillin and metro will provide relief. warm saline gargles will help. in case of abscess due to gum infection scaling has to be done along with medicines. in case of tooth abscess it if it does not heal discectomy can be done. if it is traumatic gum abscess it mostly heals on its own, you can do warm saline rinses. hope this information helps. if you find the answer helpful please give me a five-star review and click on found the answer helpful as a token of appreciation. thanks and regards. chat doctor. ."

"hello . a had a wisdom tooth removed last monday . all seems well , except for a very small , hard white bump on the inner gum area at the extraction site . its extremely hard , almost like a piece of tooth . pm wondering if its an abscess or some type of infection .",3,5711,hi. thanks for the query as per your complaint sore throat can be seen associated with wisdom tooth related infection and inflammation as the area of wisdom teeth is very close to throat and inflammation from wisdom tooth can even make the throat sore and painful. but runny nose is not commonly seen with sore throat if it is related to wisdom tooth and can be due to other causes like sinus infection or upper respiratory infection. so for this you can consult a physician and get evaluated. for tender gum around wisdom tooth that seems to be due to peritonitis which is inflammation of gum flap due to food accumulation and infection between gum flap and tooth. whether tooth is impacted or not can be ruled out with x-ray. for this consult an oral physician and get evaluated and an x-ray of the tooth will be done.first to reduce infection the area will be irrigated with antiseptic solution followed by a course of antibiotics like augmenting and anti-inflammatory painkillers like ibuprofen. warm saline gargle will also help. once the inflammation reduce then if the wisdom tooth is not impacted then it will be left to erupt. in case if the tenderness recurs then the gum flap will be removed to prevent recurrence. if the tooth is impacted then extraction is the best line of treatment. hope this helps. regards.

by one of friend has severe problem related to her behavior . the repeatedly say one thing several times and exaggerates this to the extent that she loses her temperament and starts abusive languages even to her parents . she has two months baby but she does not care for her also .,1,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"good day , two weeks ago i found out a lump in the size of pea in the lower part of my leg in the area between my knee and foot on the side part , it is colourless and painless unless i push it , then it started to pain a little bit , it has an extension just a few centimetres , i was wondering what kind of lump ? am not a person who does sport but am not a fat person , a thin man , and recently i did a few jogging just for a few minutes , then i started to feel some pains in the bones of my legs between my knee and foot due to sudden running that my body was not used on and a while later i discovered this lump so what could this be ? ? ? can it be a cancer but the area is not a common place for cancer i would be very appreciative to you sir if you could help me ? thank you",1,33931,"hi michele jacobi the first thing that has to be done once you find a lump in the region of the chest wall is to confirm what it is. in your case a biopsy has already been done and let us await its result. you're understanding that cancerous lumps don't bleed after biopsy is correct. but i think your presumption that if it was scar tissue it would have bled is not correct. scar tissue also need not bleed. needle biopsies do not usually cause any bleeding unless a blood vessel is ruptured during the procedure since how long have you noticed this lump. is the size of the lump increasing ? if the biopsy comes as positive for cancer then you will have to undergo a series of investigation to find out he the extent of the disease. ? whether it is confined to the chest wall only or whether it has gone beyond the chest wall to other regions. treatment decision will depend on the results of this if the biopsy comes as negative for cancer then there are 2 options 1- if your physician thinks it is insignificant then you need to follow it up. just keep a check on your lump to see whether it is increasing in size and also get it checked by your physician regularly2- the second option (and my preference) is to do an open biopsy especially if the lump was detected recently and is increasing in size and also if the lump is firm to hard (and not very soft). the reason is needle biopsy can be negative, but this does not always mean there is no cancer especially if the tissue sample taken is not adequate. also time factor is important. you may lose time keeping the lump under follow up to see whether it is increasing in size hope you are satisfied with my reply. anyway don't worry. follow your doctors' advice chat doctor."

"by husband has been diagnosed with liver cirrhosis from fatty infiltration . be has had hepatic encephalopathy with elevated ammonia levels . be now is chewing on his tongue . ( be has no teeth , so no injuries , but his tongue is very sore . ) be does this unconsciously , even at night and can not seem to stop . is this another symptom from this disease process ?",1,100031,"the major concern with this ultrasound is the cirrhotic liver with ascites. when the liver is badly damaged with scarring (cirrhosis), it doesn't work very well. blood flowing through the scarred liver gets backed up and creates high pressure in the liver, which in turn results in fluid leaking in to the abdomen (ascites). unfortunately, cirrhosis with ascites may be an indication that his liver is starting to fail. the kidney shows that a stone is present, but that does not seem to be causing any problems. no other findings are of significance. what needs to be done now is to take a sample of the ascites fluid and determine if it is truly related to the liver cirrhosis or something else. liver disease is the most common cause of ascites, but other conditions may cause it as well, and treatment may differ. further investigation of the liver status may also be needed, such as a biopsy. usually the spleen is enlarged when ascites develops with a cirrhotic liver, and his spleen is normal, so perhaps another more treatable condition is present. liver failure from cirrhosis is the worst case scenario. further evaluation should help define his situation better. hope this helps."

"i , a had unprotected sex a month ago and took the morning after pill the following day . a few days later a had a very heavy period that lasted a week . a am now due my 2nd period and have experienced spotting ( brownish sometimes with a little red in it ) but nothing like a normal period . is this of ? also , be advised that a gave birth 9 weeks ago .",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

a woke up from a sound sleep with pain in the chest that went into my left arm and then my left leg and arm went numb to the point a had trouble moving . the next morning a was very tired and sore . by father has already had several heart attacks and we had genetic heart disease in our family . a have gone to the hospital several time and was told it was angina . nothing to worry about . by concern is this time it seemed a little different . is this also normal for angina ? or could it have been a mild heart attack ?,1,105472,"hello. thank you for your question and welcome to chat doctor. i understand your concern. chest pain can be elicited by many origins. it can come from the coronary arteries, from linings within the rib cage, from lungs, the esophagus, the stomach etc. without further details, i would like to describe the angina. angina (pain originated by blockages in coronary arteries) is more described like a heaviness or tenderness or squeezing sensation in the mid-chest, rather than clear-cut pain. it then can spread to the jaw, left wing, shoulder and arm. this is more triggered by physical activity, but, when the blockage reaches critical measures and/or the atherosclerotic plaque is unstable, it can happen in more frequent episodes, with less physical activity and, even, at rest. furthermore, angina is the way of the heart to ""scream for help"" because it is not getting enough oxygen and nutrient supply. this kind of pain, if it is angina, happening at rest, demands a coronary angiogram, to quantitatively assess the possible blockage within the coronary artery, and to plan a strategy for treating it (with stents, merely medication or coronary artery bypass grafting). after carefully assessing and discerning about what kind of pain is this, and if it would sound like angina to me, i would also recommend a coronary angiogram as soon as possible. of course, we only give recommendations. the choice is up to you. good luck. i hope i was helpful with my answer. take care. kind regards,"

a have a bad tooth that has behaved itself mostly for some time . it has been sore to press on the area under my nose above the gum and to bit hard on it . .or if food gets into the decayed area . .but otherwise no biggie . this morning a woke up and my face is swelling in that area and sore . . . . the tooth no longer hurts however even to bite hard on it . suggestions,1,57293,"hi. welcome to chat doctor. as per your complaint it seems that you have inflammation of the gum flap surrounding the wisdom tooth and the condition is known as peritonitis. pericoronitis occurs if food gets lodged between wisdom tooth and the gum flap covering the wisdom tooth... and by food it does not mean that you see big food particles stuffed in there, but it also means uncleaned area and bacterial growth below gum flap... it leads to inflammation of the flap leading to pain swelling and as the area lies close to the throat there can be sore throat and swollen lymph nodes. but pain in the tooth in front of the wisdom tooth can be infection or decay in second molar tooth. the line of treatment is antibiotics, painkillers, mouthwash but only this is not enough to you, you should go to dentist again and ask him to irrigate the area between gum flap and wisdom tooth with saline, betadine solution and hy chat doctor. . other thing is done warm saline gargles, it will help you to reduce inflammation... carry on with the course of your antibiotics and painkillers, your pain and swelling must go in two three days. once you get relieved of your discomfort visit the dentist again and get an iop ar (x-ray) done to find out whether wisdom tooth will erupt to proper occlusion or is impacted (means having an obstruction and won't erupt to occlusion). if it is not impacted just get your gum flap removed known as operculectomy and if impacted get your tooth extracted... this will be your ultimate treatment and finish your problem forever. if the second molar tooth is also decayed leading to pain you can get root canal treatment done to save the tooth and resolve infection. hope you recover soon. thanks and regards."

"a a not sure if i a pregnant . i had my last period on the 28th of august . on the 8th of september i had protected sex with my boyfriend , who ejaculated inside me and the condom did not break . i did not take any contraceptive pills and nor am i on any kind of birth control pills . my periods are fairly regular but this time they have been delayed by a week . my boyfriend is going to be a doctor soon , so by taking his advice i had a home pregnancy test 2 days back and the result was negative . but the dilemma i a facing is with the symptoms ; i have had severe cold 5 days back ( which i inferred could be because of the weather change , it is very normal with me ) , i have been experiencing cramps in my lower abdomen similar to the pain i get during my periods , but when i checked i saw brown spots . my periods haven still come and i a nervous . i done want to have a baby now as me and my boyfriend are still young to parent a child , i a 20 and he is 21. plus , my breasts agent sensitive , i done have nausea nor frequent urination . plus help ! i a really confused ..",1,33341,"hi, if you came to my clinic with those complaints i would ask you to stop worrying. many women that start using the pills for the first time experience similar problems. i understand that you have taken the inactive pills first and then started on the active pills. also, you have had intercourse only after your period was over that is about 11 days ago. the chances of pregnancy occurring after a single act of unprotected sexual intercourse are only 4%. also, for women that have regular periods the chance of getting pregnant is more if intercourse occurs after 11-12 days since the first day of the period. hence, the chances of getting pregnant are low if you have had contact before this period. you are also having a sick feeling in the stomach and most probably a cramp like feeling. this may be due to the pills as some females take time to get adjusted and may improve with continuous use and by taking the pills with food. the pills are not known to cause any major effect on the baby if they are inadvertently taken in early pregnancy. since you have started taking the active pills late, i would recommend that you use a backup contraceptive measure like condoms, for the next 7 days while you still take the pills to avoid pregnancy. i would be pleased to answer any further queries that you may have, enjoy a wonderful day."

we were trying to conceive for the first time this month . my usual cycle is around 33 days . however i have not had my periods for the past 41 days and my urine test is negative . of i have 5mg northhisterene 2 times a day for 5 days and after this i would assume i would have my period . but can we try to conceive immediately after this ?,1,9944,"hi, welcome to chat doctor forum. you have irregular periods, since one year. if the cause is the p.c.o.s, it is better to get it treated for good conception. for a woman with regularly irregular periods means every 20 days, or 35 days etc., the day of the ovulation is 14 days prior to the previous period. for irregularly irregular periods, means one month 25 days and next month 40 days we can't predict. as the follicle size is 6 mm you can conceive provided you have medicine for ovulation, and have sex the following 2 days. so i advise you to consult a gynecologist for diagnosis and treatment. wishing for a quick and complete recovery. thank you"

"i had been on treatment for high prolactin levels ( 100ng/ml ) , later on lowered to 65ng/ml 5 months ago and had unprotected intercourse ( trying to conceive ) for the past 14 months.my period are appearing every 35 days , but the last one was 4 days late and it came as soon as we had intercourse with my husband.is there a chance that i could conceive soon ?",1,12366,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, i want to reassure you that it commonly can take up to a year from healthy couples to conceive. you are not diagnosed as infertile unless you and your husband have been trying to conceive (which means having unprotected intercourse at least two or three days a week) for at least a year. folic acid is a b vitamin that does not help you to get pregnant, however it is recommended to take during early pregnancy because it helps prevent birth defects. siphene, also known as camphene citrate, is a fertility medication. it can help induce ovulation in women who are infertile because they do not ovulate. however, if your periods normally come every month, there is no reason to suspect that you are not ovulating. because you are under the age of 35, i recommend that you and your husband to not take any more fertility medications and try to conceive for another six months on your own. normally, your most fertile time is between the time your period stops until you start to feel premenstrual symptoms. for most couples, that means having sex every other day from about the seventh day of your cycle until the 23rd to 25th day. if you and your husband have not conceived in another six months, i recommend both of you see fertility specialist, as 50% of the time lack of pregnancy can be a problem with the men sperm as well. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful, and you and your husband are able to have a baby soon. best wishes,"

"by husband has been having a dull ache on the left side of his stomach for the last several days . yes felt a bit weak , even a little nausea , but it comes and goes frequently . to problems with bowel movements . this morning woke up coughing up a bit of brown phlegm . would this be signs of an ulcer ?",1,16737,"hallow dear, brown vaginal bleeding is old bleeding which remains inside for few days and then comes out. when it is of substantial amount, we suspect risk to the life of the baby. however, the bleeding was trivial and after such bleeding, you have been examined in the hospital and sent home with assurance. so no need to worry about the baby. it is likely that the mouth of the uterus (cervix) has started preparing for the delivery by getting gradually merged into the uterine walls. this process known as effacement of the cervix causes dislodgement of the mucous plug in the cervical canal with some bleeding. when such blood stained mucous come out immediately, it is red, however if it remains inside the vagina (due to very little amount or position) or cervix, the blood and thus the discharge becomes brown. however, 36 weeks is too early for starting labor process. so i would advise you to have complete rest in the house in a view to postpone the starting of labor pains as far as possible, at least for one week more. it would be good practice to monitor the well-being of the baby by listening to heart sounds (if you can do that) and/or counting the movements of the baby by clock. in left side position lying, in two hours, 10 movements are perceivable. if you note fetal movements getting affected, please report to the obstetrician asap. i hope this helps you."

a chipped my tooth yesterday so today a went to the dentist to get it bonded together so there was no chip .. a didst know there was also a cavity in that same tooth .. so the dentist did what ever he was supposed to then he fixed the chipped tooth . a left the dentist completely numb .. which a am not complaining about because a hate pain . but now that it is starting to ware off .. the whole right side of my nose/face hurt . is this just from the shot ? will it go away or is there an infection ? a have had an infection before due to the dentist not doing the filling correctly .. which resulted in a root canal ... which resulted in more pain so ended up removing the tooth . thanks,1,91057,"hi. can understand your concern. as per your complaint if you have pain in the gum below the tooth that was filled 3 months back there may be a few reasons for it. one can be that when the cavity was made to clear off the decay, some portion of the infection must have left out and filling was done over it. now the infection that was left out further progressed and reached pulp that is central portion of tooth containing nerves and blood vessels and through there to the root canals inside roots and finally reaching the bone below root tips causing infection and pus formation which causes pain on touching the gums. other reason can be that there could have been some leakage through the filling causing seepage of food debris below the filling and thereby causing infection which infects pulp and progresses below root tips and causes pain and pus formation. one more reason can be that the cavity made for filling is chat doctor. i would suggest you to consult your dentist and get an iop ar (x-ray)done so that the exact cause of pain is understood. in most circumstances of pain in tooth after filling the treatment to be carried out is root canal treatment in which entire pulp is extirpated and filling is done in root canals as well as crown of tooth... hope your query is solved. thanks and regards."

by potassium at the of was 3.1 .. they gave me orange fizzy drink of potassium .. also a am now on 20meqs of flora con daily .. its been 5 days since my of visit and my heart is still irregular at times .. now long does it take for potassium levels to come back to normal range ?,1,68705,"serum potassium levels above 3.0 me/liter are not considered dangerous or of great concern; they can be treated with potassium replacement by mouth. depending on the patients medical condition, other medical problems, and the patients symptoms, serum levels lower than 3.0 me/liter may require intravenous replacement. decisions are patient-specific and depend upon the diagnosis, the circumstances of the illness, and the patients' ability to tolerate fluid and medication by mouth. over the short-term, with self-limited illnesses like gastroenteritis with vomiting and diarrhea, the body is able to regulate and restore potassium levels on its own. however, if the hypokalemia is severe, or the losses of potassium are predicted to be ongoing, potassium replacement or supplementation may be required. in those patients taking diuretics, often a small amount of oral potassium may be prescribed since the loss will continue as long as the medication is prescribed. oral supplements may be in pill or liquid form, and the dosages are measured in me (milliequivalents). common doses are 10-20meq per day. alternatively, consumption of foods high in potassium may be the first option in replacing potassium. bananas, apricots, oranges, and tomatoes are high in potassium content. since potassium is excreted in the kidney, blood tests that monitor kidney function may be ordered to predict and prevent potassium levels from rising too high. when potassium needs to be given intravenously, it must be given slowly. potassium is irritating to the vein and is usually administered at a maximal rate of 10 me per hour. moreover, infusing potassium too quickly can cause heart irritation and promote potentially dangerous rhythms such as ventricular tachycardia. the body is usually able to maintain potassium levels within the normal range as long as there is adequate potassium in the diet. when the body loses potassium due to a short-term illness, the body is able to compensate for the loss. when the potassium loss is being ongoing, it is important for the patient and health-care professional to anticipate the loss, and consider routine potassium replacement. the most essential step in any treatment plan for copd is to stop all smoking. it's the only way to keep copd from getting worse which can eventually reduce your ability to breathe. but quitting smoking isn't easy. and this task may seem particularly daunting if you've tried to quit and have been unsuccessful. talk to your doctor about nicotine replacement products and medications that might help, as well as how to handle relapses. your doctor may also recommend a support group for people who want to quit smoking. it's also a good idea to avoid secondhand smoke exposure whenever possible. medicationsdoctors use several kinds of medications to treat the symptoms and complications of copd. you may take some medications on a regular basis and others as needed. bronchodilatorsthese medications which usually come in an inhaler relax the muscles around your airways. this can help relieve coughing and shortness of breath and make breathing easier. depending on the severity of your disease, you may need a short-acting bronchodilator before activities, a long-acting bronchodilator that you use every day or both. regards chat doctor."

"i a 56 years old ... my weight is around 78 .. my height is 5/7 .. my query is , from the last one year when ever i do some physical work i feel a chest pain .. then i have to rest for a day or 2 .. now when i went for a check up now ... tmt test was done and it showed that there is some problem ... then my angiography was done then it showed my main artery is 100 % blocked ... i have no diabetes and blood pressure .. so my question is will angioplasty will work in this condition or not ...",1,105243,"hellothanks for posting at chat doctor. your wife has symptoms of chest pain and discomfort on exertion which are very typical for angina sectors or ischemic heart disease. this means there are some blocks in the heart arteries. when a patient with such blocks walks or exercises, the heart rate increases and its blood and oxygen demand increases. since the arteries are blocked, they cannot cope up with the extra demand of blood and oxygen while exercising or walking. this causes the chest pain/discomfort. this same principle is used in a tmt. you are made to exercise on a treadmill while your ecg is continuously being recorded to see whether the ecg shows changes while walking corresponding to her chest pain. hence, it is called provocable ischemia since we provoke the event. before a tmt, a target heart rate is set for the patient till which the patient is usually made to walk on the treadmill. this target heart rate is usually 220 - age of the patient. your wives tmt showed changes of ischemia or deficiency in blood supply at 74% of this target heart rate. hence, this is a positive test and indicates a strong possibility of blockages in the heart in view of typical symptoms and a positive tmt. your cardiologist will advise a coronary angiography for her which is an invasive test done through a small hole in the hand or the leg. this will show the blockages in the heart and their severity. on basis of the angiography findings, further treatment (medical management vs angioplasty vs bypass) can be discussed. my feeling is she would require an angioplasty. please go ahead with an angiography and revert with the findings. wishing her good healthregards"

my 11 month old baby has a cough and was prescribed sabutamol . she was also given an inhale which is to be sprayed in her face through a styrofoam cup . she still coughs lot after 5 days of medication and brings up a bit of food/tea when coughing .. what do i do ?,1,64560,"hi, it's possible that your mothers coughing fits account to be normal, since it was a chat doctor. i would advise giving her only semisolid food that will be easy on her food pipe and her gut since she is prone to hemorrhoids. it will be easier for her to swallow and digest if the food is more soft and watery. her age is the reason her gastrointestinal tract must be narrowing, hence sometimes when swallowed too fast, food can go to the wrong pipe(viz air pipe), causing a coughing impulse, since the epiglottis is sensitive, and it responds to touch by a cough impulse. hence, i would say it is nothing to worry about, when she gets this coughing spell out her in a position where she can cough out everything she swallowed since it is necessary to avoid aspirating food. after the spell, and only after the spell has subsided, and she has thrown out all food, and she is in her senses, give her a glass of water that she can slowly sip n swallow, which will ease the healing. take care. good to know you care for your mother."

hello ? husband has had a 6bypass and he is on comunadin and takes it about 7pm each day . he has a stuffed up nose evert night and he is supposed to be on a pap machine for his lib problem . nobody seems to know what to suggest .. he is on several pills a day and a wonder if his gabapentin is not making the trouble . its getting darned old to have him sitting in a recliner and me in bed wondering if he is of ... help please ...,1,33169,hi there. it seems like your husband has aggravated an underlying disc problem which he might have been having for some time. sudden exercises can aggravate such problems if somebody is not used to it. for a patient having an acute pain i would initially recommend a period of bed rest for 3-4 days until the pain subsides. he can sleep with his hips and knees flexed that will reduce a bit of pressure on the nerve roots that are getting compressed. he can take diclofenac 100 mg to add to the initial pain relief and apply some topical analgesic ointments or sprays. during the period he can walk to the bathroom and walk around as tolerated. he would need to avoid sitting for a long time if possible. then once the pain subsides he can get back to his normal day-to-day activities. then he should build up his back muscle strength by doing extension exercises. and if he is on the heavier side he should do a bit of dieting and exercises that for losing weight that will help him in the long run. any exercise regime should be started with gradual increments in the repeats. ellipse is a demanding machine and one needs to increase their training gradually. thank you.

"i .. my daughter is away at college and for the last week on and off has gotten body aches and chills and had a weird feeling and has passed out a few times .... the aches were bad .. : so much that she couldn't do much but cry ... no fever but says that when she takes advil it helps with aches .. when she eats feels better for like an hour then starts too get aches again .... and has occasional tightness in chest .... went to hospital and they took blood , urine test , nothing was irregular but white blood count was up .... they said she had flu .... does this sound right to you",1,34552,"the only thing for a cold sensation i can think of is acid reflux. when you get heart burn it feels crazy and can give anxiety (hence the rapid heart rate). you can remedy acid reflux (herd, or heart burn, throat burn or whatever you want to call it) by getting some digestive enzymes (try something like source naturals daily digestive enzymes) at a local vitamin store (or try vitacost.com) and till give her enough digestive juices to help grind up her food better. also, food intolerances will cause problems too. i discovered a food intolerance to wheat, milk and peanuts. but you have to write down how you feel after you eat something and try eliminating it for a while and see how it goes. you can ask a doctor for an elisa test (for food allergies) but it doesn't tell us much. a food elimination/rotation diet is much better plus it can't hurt. a sharp knife like feeling is definitely heart burn from what i've felt or heard about. make sure you write down when these things occur, what time and how long (dates) and what she had to eat earlier. pizza is a biggie on heart burn. hot dogs, anything with bad fats in it. bread if she is intolerant to wheat and so on. i would throw in a thyroid (tsh) test for hyper or hypothyroidism. so many symptoms stem from those diseases (difficulty breathing, rapid heart rate, digestion issues and so on)...that it should be warranted just to rule it out. and if it keeps happening see the doc. but sometimes i do believe we have to be our own detectives. my dd has a friend that was ill on and off for a couple of years and saw 11 doctors (hello, aren't they supposed to be intelligent beings?) but no, they couldn't figure out anything. finally, they figured out she has a gluten-allergy."

in 25 and trying to get pregnant . my husband has just started taking all kinds of medicine to increase his penis size and help build muscle mass and powder to gain . weight and more but a don to want to put it on here.my cycle is has been regular every since we had our first baby . just this month my cycle has been doing really really crazy stuff . so can all of his medication plus unprotected sex 3-4 times a week a messing with my body ?,1,108096,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. it is true that theoretically you should have been clear of the injection within three months of discontinuation, however many women after being a depo-provera for a long time do not resume having ovulatory, regular, menstrual cycles until 6 to 9 months or even up to a year after discontinuation. unfortunately, it is difficult to artificially induce ovulation in women who are coming off depo-provera. if you were not trying to become pregnant, your cycle could be regulated temporarily with birth control pills, but if you're actually trying to get pregnant the best thing you can do with this point is to just keep trying and wait and see. if you feel any symptoms of pregnancy, and you haven't gotten your period for a while, i would do pregnancy test just to make sure. there is always a possibility even if your periods are not regular that you do ovulate sometimes. so in summary, continue having unprotected sex every other to every three days and give it some more time. 80% of couples will conceive within one year, and if after a year of trying you and your partner are unsuccessful, it might be a good idea to see a fertility specialist for an evaluation. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes, and good luck getting pregnant,"

"i in on micrognynon 30 and have been for over 3 years now . i have never missed a period while i have been on it so in really worried as my period hast come yet . i always come on on the sunday as i finish my pack on a thursday , yet last time i was a day late and this time , its now monday , i have nothing only small cramps but nothing else . after my last period i started my pill again on the friday my normal day and that day i fooled around with my boyfriend , we didst have sex but we did rub against each other but i made sure he didst enter me at all .. in really worried that i might be pregnant as i have never missed a period before on the pill , also i have been really down and stressed during this course but that was 2 weeks ago now",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

( and will prescribe drugs only as a last resort )",1,3703,"hello, i hope i can help you today. the common medications which are used to lower cholesterol, called statins, are not safe to use during pregnancy. for one, cholesterol levels actually normally rise during pregnancy, because cholesterol is used to make a lot of the hormones and developing tissues, such as the brain, in the fetus. for that reason, many medical professionals do not recommend any woman of reproductive age to start using cholesterol-lowering medication. the other reason is that the chance at your age of your actually having a heart attack or stroke just from high cholesterol is still extremely low. at your age, the likelihood of your having problems conceiving are relatively low and the best way to have a healthy pregnancy is to be healthy before you get pregnant. so i recommend following your doctors instructions regarding cholesterol-lowering medication, and delaying pregnancy until your cholesterol is under better control. in addition to medications there may be diet and exercise recommendations that your doctor may have which will put you in a better state of health then you are right now. so in summary, high cholesterol does not affect the fetus in any negative way, and the body actually makes more cholesterol during pregnancy to provide the fetus with nutrition. however, cholesterol-lowering medication can actually harm the fetus by decreasing cholesterol levels to the point where the proper development of the fetus could be compromised. so in order to both keep the baby safe and improve your health i would recommend delaying pregnancy until after you've worked with your primary physician in order to lower your cholesterol and get your body into a healthier state to prepare for pregnancy. you should be off cholesterol-lowering medication at the time you are trying to conceive. in the long run, missing high cholesterol medication for about a year especially at your young age and if you do not have any other cardiac risk factors, will not do harm to you. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"i , may a answer your health queries right now ? please type your query here ... a am 31 weeks pregnant and have gestational diabetes . by concern is after being on strick diet and insulin morning 10 units and night 8 units , my postprandial sugar level is in the range of 135-160. what should i do now ?",1,98003,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the greatest likelihood in your situation is that you have gestational diabetes. the majority of the time during routine prenatal care for diabetes somewhere between 24 and 28 weeks. ketones, a byproduct of sugar metabolism being present in your urine along with sugar backs up the diagnosis. if you're test for gestational diabetes was performed more than a month ago, or if you never had one, i suggest you share these results with your healthcare provider as they may want to repeat the test. gestational diabetes can be controlled sometimes with diet, however many women require oral hypoglycemics or insulin to control their blood sugar. this risk is increased in women who are obese or who have a family history of diabetes. so needing additional help in reducing your blood sugar during pregnancy is common and is not the fault of an inability to properly follow a proper diet. so i suggest for the benefit of the health of your pregnancy that you make an appointment with your prenatal care provider and that you discuss your results with them, they may want to do more intensive screening for diabetes and depending upon the level of your blood sugar may prescribe medications. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

a had my last period on 7aug .... and tested for pregnancy on 2sep and it was positive .... when my gynaecologist did a ultrasound on 14sep and it said am 5weeks 3days but according to my gynaecologist a should be least 9weeks now and she said its late conception and we have to check for viability after two weeks .... at are the chances of taking this pregnancy forward ? to a have a chance of miscarriage ? ?,1,61378,i can understand your situation. usually pregnancy duration is calculated from last menstrual period or doing an ultrasonography. pregnancy test usually becomes positive at least 4 was following lmp and 2 was after fertilization. from this calculation and from the information you have provided it can be said that on 26th february when your wives pregnancy test become positive she has pregnancy duration somewhat between 4 weeks and 5 weeks 3 says as it was negative on 15th of february. 1st of all a usg has to be done to determine pregnancy duration and then abortion can be tried medically or surgically depending on the pregnancy duration.

have been trying to conceive for three years but have failed.my gone put me on letrozole and hyponidd combo but failed too . later she introduced me to injections which have also not bore fruits ... what could be the problem because i do ovulate normal . cecil,1,74690,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. letrozole is a strong fertility medication that can produce ovulation in women who normally do not ovulate, such as women with pcs. the ovid ac injection just induces you to ovulate at the correct time in your cycle to correspond usually with a timed insemination, either by intercourse, or by gui. the fertility medication itself does not cause any risk to the baby if you do conceive, because the medications only affect your ovulation and ability to conceive. however, fertility medications such as metronome can produce high order multiple gestation (triplets and above) in women with pcs because pcs is a disease where women have many immature eggs waiting to be released. if you successfully conceive only one baby, your pregnancy is no more a risk than any other obese woman. you will have a higher risk of diabetes and high blood pressure during your pregnancy, and they should be tested for and monitored carefully, but with proper prenatal care women with pcs and obesity can have successful pregnancies. so in summary, the fertility medications that you have been treated with really only increase the risk of conceiving multiple babies at the same time. the medications do not cause birth defects and are out of your system by the time you actually get pregnant. however, unless you have already tried milder ovulation induction medications (not injections) that failed in the past, i caution against the use of metronome as women with pcs frequently conceive multiple eggs at the same time and twins or even higher order multiple pregnancies are possible. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today, and i wish you the best in conceiving a healthy pregnancy. best wishes,"

i my husband 43yrs old diabetic has had high blood sugars this evening . just a few minutes ago his left side went tingling including his tongue . be said this tongue has a metallic taste . a took his blood pressure and it was of & he did take some baby aspirin . blood sugars are coming down now and the tingling feeling is diminished to both feet and shin area .,1,26614,"hello madam, i understand your concern about your husband. a diabetic patient can have tingling sensation in his body as a result of nerve damage due to high blood sugars, but the pattern of these sensations is usually chronic, symmetrical in both feet extending up to legs(sometimes up to thighs and trunk also) and both hands extending up to forearms(sometimes arms and face also). but this is usually symmetrical and chronic. in your husbands' case it appears to be a sudden episodic, sharply demarcated to one side of the body including face and tongue(which is unusual). being of sudden onset and restricted to one side of the body followed by recovery, these sensory symptoms mandates a neurological consultation to rule out a vascular event like a transient ischemic attack or even stroke(although, sharp demarcation of sensory abnormality including face and tongue is rare in stroke). improved and now limited symmetrically to both feet and shin area, is something i mentioned above and well explainable with diabetes. i hope it will be of help."

hi i am almost 6 months pregnant and the gum behind my impacted wisdom tooth is sore and inflamed . i went to the dentist and he said for me to salt water rinse and good oral hygiene and i should be okay . the pain int that bad only a little sore when my tongue touches it . to you think i will be able to wait after i give birth to remove my tooth ? i have only 3 more months .,1,5711,hi. thanks for the query as per your complaint sore throat can be seen associated with wisdom tooth related infection and inflammation as the area of wisdom teeth is very close to throat and inflammation from wisdom tooth can even make the throat sore and painful. but runny nose is not commonly seen with sore throat if it is related to wisdom tooth and can be due to other causes like sinus infection or upper respiratory infection. so for this you can consult a physician and get evaluated. for tender gum around wisdom tooth that seems to be due to peritonitis which is inflammation of gum flap due to food accumulation and infection between gum flap and tooth. whether tooth is impacted or not can be ruled out with x-ray. for this consult an oral physician and get evaluated and an x-ray of the tooth will be done.first to reduce infection the area will be irrigated with antiseptic solution followed by a course of antibiotics like augmenting and anti-inflammatory painkillers like ibuprofen. warm saline gargle will also help. once the inflammation reduce then if the wisdom tooth is not impacted then it will be left to erupt. in case if the tenderness recurs then the gum flap will be removed to prevent recurrence. if the tooth is impacted then extraction is the best line of treatment. hope this helps. regards.

(aerobic culture, tb gene expert and sputum for afb. this will show us what organisms are infecting your lungs and the chat doctor. if all above tests come out normal, and you still have cough, a hrct chest is recommended which shows us fine cuts of lung tissue to rule out other causes, or hiding infection and also can live information about heart, lymph nodes and other structures in the chest. please do the above and revert. wishing you good healthregards"

"help my three or old daughter has been fully toilet trained for a or now but has suddenly become completely incontinent , most of the time she doesn't even realise she has wet herself , she says it doesn't hurt when she wee a but in having to constantly change and wash her , what could this be ?",3,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

my baby is 15 weeks old and eats cow and gate formula milk . for the last month he has been eating 8oz bottles which he finish all of every fed . in the last to weeks i have started giving him stage 2 milk for hungrier babies but he is still eating the same amount . he is now at the point where he eats every 2 to 3 hours and is having a least seven bottles a day or more . he still seems to want more food . what do i do ?,1,25921,mothers breast milk is the best possible food for a baby and there can be no alternatives for the same. most of the formula milks are cow milk based and hence hard to digest for the baby. nan-1 and lactose are both cow milk based formula manufactured by the same company where certain items have been added or removed from lactose to make nan-1 more like breast milk. dha has also been added since it is required for the developing brain but do not expect it to enhance brain development. nan-1 is more preferable to cow milk if breast milk is unavailable. please try to give breast milk as much as possible and supplement only the rest.

i am 26 years old.i have been married since 6 months.i it my last period before two months.earlier it started like spotting for 4 or 5 days.then the flow was normal as we are getting during menstrual time.after 7 days the it was less about to stop.but again it started.nt like regular normal flow.it was looking like deep red in colour.since that time it has not stopped.its been 2 months nw.i a getting a little pain in my belly from two days.i am doing jogging also occasionally .,1,8772,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the proper way to use the nearing is to put it in, leave it in for 3 weeks, take it out, wait one week, and replace it. during the week you are not wearing the ring, you should have some bleeding that is considered a menstrual cycle. if you wore the ring continuously for two months and then had a new one replaced but only removed it 3 days later, the pinkish spotting was your ""period"", which is caused by not wearing the ring. the bleeding was very light because you had suppressed it by continuously wearing the ring for over 2 months. so you should expect your next period about 4-5 weeks after the episode of spotting that you had. if you do not have menses by then, i recommend repeating the pregnancy test at that time. if you did not have regular monthly cycles before you used the ring, your cycle will follow your regular pattern that you typically have when not using hormonal contraception. if you are trying to get pregnant, you should have intercourse about every other day and begin taking prenatal vitamins as it benefits the health of the baby for the vitamins to be present at conception. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"i i would like to ask something , by sister hast been eating lot ( hardly ) she doesn't sleep or talk . by sister claims that she sees shadows of people that she knows and sometimes sees their face also she hears voices and she has extreme mood swings . the cant control her anger but she tries and then she wants to be left alone . the never told us before because shes really quite and cries lot now that shes 18 she has told her family . a few days ago she screamed loudly . i wan a know whats wrong with her .",1,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

a have sever toothache advise me tablets i fell hot a cold in that teeth since 2 days now pain since last night ? ply,1,105885,"hello, i can understand your concern. as you have got root canals on all of your teeth, if the treatment has been done well, there is less chance that the teeth can cause pain as they have become non-vital after root canal treatment. in addition, the root of the upper molar teeth lie near to or inside the maxillary sinus. so when the maxillary sinuses are congested sue to could and sinusitis, they cause pressure on the teeth and cause pain. when you cough or sneeze or blow your nose, the fluid moves inside the sinus and that causes severe toothache. when your cold and sinusitis will get cured, you will find relief in toothache. you have not broken any blood vessel in brain so do not worry about that. thus, i would advise you to take azithromycin 500 mg (aee 500) once a day for 3 days along with levocetrizine 5 mg (exocet) once a day for 5 days. you can also use nasal decongestants. hot water vapor inhalation will help a lot in clearing sinuses. if you do not feel better in 5 days, you should visit an ent specialist for further investigations and treatment. if the teeth keep paining after clearing sinuses, you should visit a dentist to follow up on the teeth for re-infection in the root canals. i hope this information helps you. thank you for choosing chat doctor. i wish you feel better soon. best,"

a am 11 weeks pregnant with my first child and having been suffering with the symptoms associated with a kidney infection for 2 weeks -having undergone the routine blood tests it was stated how i have low white blood cells and the of subsequently asked me to complete a urine test . having completed 2 such tests they confirmed i had an infection and started me on a course of amoxicillin today . any further advice would be much appreciated regarding whether there maybe an underlying cause to the low white blood cells and the possible risks to my unborn child ? any thanks b.buckland,1,26797,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. low white blood cells (which are the disease-fighting cells in your body) can occur both as a result of a disease that lowers your white cell count (like hiv) or by consumption when your body is working hard to clear an infection. in your case, your doctors were concerned you had an infection in your body causing your white blood cells to fall. they found the infection in your kidneys and prescribed an antibiotic, which is it works, should clear the infection and your white cell count will return to normal. your white cell count and you're having a kidney infection does not affect the baby at all as long as you are treated properly and follow your doctors' advice. my only concern is that if you truly have a kidney infection, amoxicillin is not a particularly strong antibiotic for urinary tract infections. so if you have taken the medication for a few days, and you still have fever higher than 38.5 celsius, (101f) or bad flank pain occasionally iv antibiotics are needed for treatment. i hope my answer was helpful for you today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"in young and i hardly ever smoke but when i was i got really weak and light headed and collapsed and felt like i was going to faint while standing , why did this happen ? i googled it and some people said that it happen to them and they found out they had a heart diesel ?",1,93607,"hi! yes, it is possible that a normal ecg is followed by an abnormal stress test. the ecg done when the person is at rest, does not always show the problem of coronary heart disease. this is because while resting, the heart gets the amount of blood and oxygen that it needs to work. that is why, when there has been a typical chest pain and the ecg at rest was normal, the doctor recommends a stress test-ecg. during this stress, the heart job increases and the amount of blood and oxygen that it needs are doubled. in a healthy person, the heart work and the amount of blood and oxygen that it needs are in balance, while in coronary heart disease they are disbalance (stress test shows abnormalities). i tried to explain why it can happen to have a normal ecg and an abnormal stress test-ecg. i hope to have been clear enough for you. i wish your father gets better soon! thanks for sharing your concern with us! all the best,"

"hiya there i recently had an abortion well it will be 2 weeks ago on monday i had sex after 1 and a half weeks could i get pregnant as me a my partner was told we could not have kids as we both had fertility problems then i had a 1 night stand a fell pregnant was not sure who the was dad was that why i had a abortion , but i want a baby wit my husband",1,59325,"hallow dear, the last period you had 3 weeks after discontinuing the pills for 4-5 days was normal. if after that you had no period for 7 weeks, it indicates you could be pregnant. however, you are having brown bleeding for last week. this could be missed abortion. pregnancy immediately after discontinuation of birth control pills do have a risk of spontaneous abortion. please report to your obstetrician for correct diagnosis. you may need surgical evacuation if the abortion is not complete. this could be incidental abortion and need not repeat in the future. hope this helps you."

a have a sharp burning type pain in my upper abdomen . it feels as though its near the surface of the skin and the skin above the pain is completely numb . the pain is localized above the lower most rib and about an inch and a half from the sternum . the numb surface skin is about two inches in diameter . a have had the pain for a few years but it has recently been getting much worse and more frequent . mostly when pm sitting . a stretch can often make the pain lessen .,1,52357,"hi, thanks for writing in. a mole is an area in the skin surface where there is an excess of pigment deposition. our skin gets its color from melanin pigment present in the skin. in a dark skin person, there is a higher quantity of melanin produced by the cells on the skin surface. in a light colored person, the melanin produced by skin cells is less. when the melanin is secreted in higher quantity in a particular spot on the skin surface, this gives rise to a mole and there can also be associated increased cell growth. the multicolor nature in a mole is due to the variable concentration of pigments in it. a mole is benign in most cases. however, if it develops sudden increase in size, appearance of hair on surface or pain sensation and ulcer formation then you should consult your doctor immediately. they will scrape the cells from mole surface if required and then confirm if it is a concern. please do not worry."

"a am on birth control and take it usually at 10 on every night . last friday a had unprotected sex with my boyfriend withdrawing and did to take my pill that night , but instead at 9 am the next morning , and took my saturday pill at the normal time . ( this was on my third week of pills ) a am now on my placebo pills and am late for my pill , is there a chance of pregnancy ?",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"recently a have been clenching my teeth at night , and the other day a had crunched down on something hard ( may be a loose filling ) and after that my back tooth and gum has been causing throbbing pain and every time a rub my tongue against the gum underneath the tooth it causes a lot of pain .",1,91057,"hi. can understand your concern. as per your complaint if you have pain in the gum below the tooth that was filled 3 months back there may be a few reasons for it. one can be that when the cavity was made to clear off the decay, some portion of the infection must have left out and filling was done over it. now the infection that was left out further progressed and reached pulp that is central portion of tooth containing nerves and blood vessels and through there to the root canals inside roots and finally reaching the bone below root tips causing infection and pus formation which causes pain on touching the gums. other reason can be that there could have been some leakage through the filling causing seepage of food debris below the filling and thereby causing infection which infects pulp and progresses below root tips and causes pain and pus formation. one more reason can be that the cavity made for filling is chat doctor. i would suggest you to consult your dentist and get an iop ar (x-ray)done so that the exact cause of pain is understood. in most circumstances of pain in tooth after filling the treatment to be carried out is root canal treatment in which entire pulp is extirpated and filling is done in root canals as well as crown of tooth... hope your query is solved. thanks and regards."

"i , please advice me on the issue of muscles reduction . by cousin having one side muscle reduction problem . her arms and thigh muscle get reducing day by day without any pain.please advice the issue relates to euro , if yes then to whom i should consult .",3,57758,"hi, in your case, there are few information that would be very helpful for me (if you have provided): - do you have a low back pain (i assume not)- do you have a paresthesia in the legs or feet-did you have a history of any trauma to low back or gluteal area?- did you have a history of any intramuscular injection before the symptoms?- for how long do you have these problems? please provide these answers to any doctor that you seek his/her advice in the future. overall, based on the provided information, a thigh pain referring to the bottom of the leg most commonly originates from a nerve, a muscle or joint. i summarize them here: 1- nerve: it is possible that you have a disk protrusion at a low back area. sometimes a protruded disk induces pressure to the adjacent nerve and causes thigh pain. in some cases there is no low back pain. also, if the sciatic nerve is irritated by any cause, it causes the same problem (this is a rare cause).2- muscle: a tight muscle area (trigger point) in some gluteal and thigh areas can cause posterior thigh pain with radiation to the leg. 3- joint: there are small joints above and below any vertebral bone. we call them facet joint. if the facet joint of the l5 vertebra (the fifth vertebra) is irritated or damaged by any cause, it can cause thigh pain, which is sometimes not accompanied by a low back pain. in conclusion, if your problem is for only a few days you can take a 3-5 day course of an anti-inflammatory medication (such as ibuprofen, diclofenac, ...) and an anti-spasm medication (such as baclofen), (certainly if you don't have any contraindication to use them. if you have the problem for more than 2 weeks you should be visited by a physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist, orthopedist, or rheumatologist for a more accurate diagnosis. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

a am having chronic back pain neck and lower the most rate right now lower back 7-8 of had a mri without contrast of showed multilevel disc desiccation with undulate spurring and list height loss posterior disc bulging greater on right disc osterophyte and later facet arthoropathy moderately severe and neural foraminal borrowing and canal stenosis facet hypertrophy i am in so much pain help me understand please,1,26999,dear patient there are two reasons for your back 1. facetal degeneration and hypertrophy suggestive of instability 2. disc degeneration and spurring with arthritic changes may be related to age. the reason for pain in limbs is canal stenosis with nerve compression and ischemia resulting in neurological claudication. facet joints are on both sides of vertebra and holds both vertebra together with intervertebral disc. degenerative changes in disc leads to loss in their height which strains facet joints. in turn facet joints reacts by hypertrophy and arthritis trying for natural fusion. all this process leads to back pain. nerve roots pass through narrow canal known as spinal canal. narrowing of canal due to bony spurs and ligamentum flavor hypertrophy leads to canal stenosis. this impedes blood supply of nerve roots and pain in lower limbs while you walk. you need to consult spine surgeon to discuss various treatment options like canal decompression or fusion. all the best.
