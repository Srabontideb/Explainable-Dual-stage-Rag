"i , my 4 year old ( girl ) she is currently experiencing an ammonia smell when she urine and when she does not urinate.she has avoided large amounts of sugar and is drinking water & cranberry juice.no fever , drinks and eats normally , seems healthy.what should a do ?",2,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"a have been diagnosed with lyme disease and have had symptoms for over two months that include severe fatigue , headaches , knee and hip joint pain , nausea , stiff neck and back . get a am being told by doctors that the lyme disease is no longer active . a have been on 2 cycles of antibiotics already . that else can i do or what else could it be ?",1,59679,"hello dear. lyme disease is related to painful rashes on armpit and thigh, but may not be related to brain scarring. lyme disease is usually curable with antibiotics. this is so true that some authors of lyme disease research have stated that the most common cause of lack of response of lyme disease to antibiotics is a lack of lyme disease to begin with! the type of antibiotic depends on the stage of the disease (early or late) and what areas of the body are affected. early illness is usually effectively treated with medications taken by mouth, for example, doxycycline (tobramycin), amoxicillin (mobil), or cefuroxime acetic (certain). these generally result in a rapid cure of lyme disease. therefore, if a person finds a typical bulls-eye skin rash (described above) developing in an area of a tick bite, they should seek medical attention as soon as possible. generally, antibiotic treatment resolves the rash within one or two weeks with no long-term consequences. later illness such as nervous-system disease might require intravenous chat doctor. there are no home remedies to treat lyme disease. in those people with two or more episodes of erythema migrant rash, even years apart, it is felt that the episodes represent different infections or reinfection rather than persistence of the original infection. for relief of lyme disease symptoms, pain-relieving medicines might be added. swollen joints can be reduced by the doctor removing fluid from them (arthrocentesis). an arthrocentesis is a procedure whereby fluid is removed from a joint using a needle and syringe under sterile conditions. it is usually performed in a doctor's office. rarely, even with appropriate antibiotics, the arthritis continues. it has been suggested by researchers that sometimes joint inflammation can persist even after eradication of the lyme bacteria. this complication has been explained as an ongoing autoimmune response causing inflammation of the joint that was initially stimulated by the original bacterial infection. oral medications such as ibuprofen (motrin, turin) can also be used to reduce inflammation and improve function. there is no evidence that nonspecific fatigue that persists after treatment for lyme disease is related to persistent infection. the risks of prolonged treatments with antibiotics are far greater than any benefit in this situation. of note, recent research was done to study whether longer-term antibiotic treatment of persistent symptoms of lyme disease led to any better outcomes than shorter-term treatment. the study found that longer-term antibiotic treatment did not have additional beneficial effects on health-related quality of life beyond those with shorter-term treatment. specifically, the researchers determined that this longer-term antibiotic treatment had no more beneficial effect on fatigue, or musculoskeletal, neuropsychological, or cognitive symptoms and disorders from lyme disease than placebo hope i have answered your question. feel free to contact me if you have any more questions. i'll be glad to help you. all the besting warm regards"

"i , my name is veronica a have had this symptom of a feeling of being chocked or a lump in my throat and it also feels like my chest is tight a do not have any difficulty in breathing but when a send a feel a rush of pressure to my head now a am most worried about this tightness of a feel on my chest and throat , might you know what can be a cause and how a can alleviate the symptom as a wait for my appointment ?",1,77258,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the sensation of feeling something stuck in your throat is a symptom of reflux-when the food that you eat or the acid in your stomach can back up and irritate it. this is common when you have a large belly at full term because your stomach is being pushed up towards your chest and also the hormones from the pregnancy cause the top opening of your stomach that connects to your esophagus to be looser, so food and acid can leak more easily. the best way to try to control this is to eat only small amounts at one time and to make sure you sit up for at least 2 hours after meals. taking antacids, which for the most part are all safe during pregnancy, can also help. trying to cough up what you feel in your throat will not help because there is not actually something solid coming up. these symptoms may be difficult to treat, but the good news is the symptoms will get better after you have the baby. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

"hello , a have symptoms of ulcer nerve damage . a was using computer on a couple of occasions ( not resting my elbow ) when then side of my hand and little finger went numb after resting my hand and forearm on the table using the laptop w/o a mouse for hours . is it possible that i damaged the nerve from the forearm forward . going on 7 weeks . thank you .",1,4458,"hello, thanks for writing to us. according to your description of numbness, it seems that you have numbness only on some patch of your forearm. if a main nerve is damaged - it will create numbness till the end of the finger. so if your numbness is patchy - it means that only a very fine nerve branch may have been damaged, if any, which is not possible to repair. the good thing is that - nerve endings do grow back, but at slow pace, some few mm in a week. so my suggestion would be to wait, as time goes by - the nerve will regrow and your numbness will disappear. to accelerate the nerve growth and minimize the numbness - you could take vitamin b 12 supplements. they are essential in nerve repairs and may help you to recover a bit faster. thank you."

"by almost 6 or old daughter has a lump near her hairline just to the left of her spine . it a very noticeable to the touch . over the past few years she will get shooting pains in that exact location . be noticed this today because she said she felt pain when tilting her head to one side when she was in class . but when a touch it she feels no pain . the also has a bumpy , itchy rash on the back of her head . not sure if this is related but thought a would mention it .",1,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"a started yak 3months back , and my period cycle has slightly changed . a had unprotected sex two weeks back , and a had to taken my pill that day but tool two the next day . by periods were supposed to come last week but nothing has happened as yet , can a be pregnant ?",1,52872,"you have written that you had unprotected intercourse twice. on which days of your menstrual cycle did you have sex? the first and the last week of your menstrual cycle are safe periods. sex done during that period does not cause pregnancy. were the two episodes of unprotected sex more than five days apart? if so you should have taken i pill twice, i.e. after each unprotected sex. if not there is a possibility of pregnancy. i pill itself can delay the period. but if the period is delayed for more than one week consult your doctor and get a pregnancy test done as i pill is not 100% effective. i hope i have answered to your satisfaction."
"a started yak 3months back , and my period cycle has slightly changed . a had unprotected sex two weeks back , and a had to taken my pill that day but tool two the next day . by periods were supposed to come last week but nothing has happened as yet , can a be pregnant ?",2,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

ave been trying for a year to get pregnant me and my soon to be husband really want a baby but can not seem to get pregnant people have told me not to try so hard so for awhile a stopped trying hoping it would happen a take lots of vitamin because my vitamin counts have always been low a feel like a need more than vitamins and fertility drugs to help us and a just want to have a baby my cycle is about every 45 days and a keep track of it on my phone can you help me ? please and thank you,1,12366,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, i want to reassure you that it commonly can take up to a year from healthy couples to conceive. you are not diagnosed as infertile unless you and your husband have been trying to conceive (which means having unprotected intercourse at least two or three days a week) for at least a year. folic acid is a b vitamin that does not help you to get pregnant, however it is recommended to take during early pregnancy because it helps prevent birth defects. siphene, also known as camphene citrate, is a fertility medication. it can help induce ovulation in women who are infertile because they do not ovulate. however, if your periods normally come every month, there is no reason to suspect that you are not ovulating. because you are under the age of 35, i recommend that you and your husband to not take any more fertility medications and try to conceive for another six months on your own. normally, your most fertile time is between the time your period stops until you start to feel premenstrual symptoms. for most couples, that means having sex every other day from about the seventh day of your cycle until the 23rd to 25th day. if you and your husband have not conceived in another six months, i recommend both of you see fertility specialist, as 50% of the time lack of pregnancy can be a problem with the men sperm as well. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful, and you and your husband are able to have a baby soon. best wishes,"

a have been trying to conceive our second child for the last 3 months with no success . this month my or performed a progesterone level at day 21 which was 0.4 . since my cycles have recently been a little longer-32 days we did another one at 25 days and it came back 1.1 . the says it a possible that my follicle enlarged but did not rupture . a a not sure what that means . is it possible to still ovulate this month later than day 25 ? should we keep trying this month ? or could a have ovulated recently and my progesterone not gone up yet ? thanks ! penny,1,52747,"hello, and i hope i can clarify this for you. you are absolutely correct in the fact that the length of your cycle is related to when you ovulate... and your ovulation date is 14 days back from when you got your period, rather than counting 14 days from the start of your period. it is typical for most women to have a 14-day luteal phase, as you suggested. you absolutely may ovulate later in your cycle. i do not know how long you and your partner have tried to conceive before trying closed. i would not recommend trying closed at all unless you have tried for a year (meaning unprotected sex at least 2-3 times per week) and not become pregnant. a reproductive endocrinologist is an appropriate referral if you have a history of infertility for one year, and if you fail at least 3 cycles of closed. they can prescribe closed and combine it with intrauterine insemination, which can increase the success rate. even though you may have had a child together before, there can be an issue with the male partner too, and it would be advisable he gets his sperm count evaluated. but you can still have conceived this cycle if you ovulated on the closed, and continued to have unprotected sex at least a week after your ovulation kit showed positive. your progesterone level pre-ovulation is not relevant at all. so- if you don't get a period by day 35 or so, do a pregnancy test. and if you didn't conceive this cycle, a reproductive endocrinologist might be a better choice to manage your closed. i hope this answered your question, and best of luck in getting pregnant. take care,"

"i , a was prescribed primolut for migraine management and have bled every day since taking for about 14 days . a thought it was suppose to stop periods . to you know why a would be experiencing constant bleeding . prior to this my menstrual cycle was usually fairly regular and normal ? a have also had tender abdomen/light period pain .",1,8772,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the proper way to use the nearing is to put it in, leave it in for 3 weeks, take it out, wait one week, and replace it. during the week you are not wearing the ring, you should have some bleeding that is considered a menstrual cycle. if you wore the ring continuously for two months and then had a new one replaced but only removed it 3 days later, the pinkish spotting was your ""period"", which is caused by not wearing the ring. the bleeding was very light because you had suppressed it by continuously wearing the ring for over 2 months. so you should expect your next period about 4-5 weeks after the episode of spotting that you had. if you do not have menses by then, i recommend repeating the pregnancy test at that time. if you did not have regular monthly cycles before you used the ring, your cycle will follow your regular pattern that you typically have when not using hormonal contraception. if you are trying to get pregnant, you should have intercourse about every other day and begin taking prenatal vitamins as it benefits the health of the baby for the vitamins to be present at conception. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

(the amount of platelets in the bloodstream is reduced because the spleen is busy trapping them). so usually people with cirrhosis end up having a problem with portal hypertension and an enlarged spleen, and a reduced platelet count in the bloodstream. as time goes by, the liver may try to repair itself by growing new cells. if there is a lot of scar tissue already present the new cells grow between scar tissue (and result in abnormal nodules). the nodules and scar tissue further interfere with blood flow through the liver. so over time people with advanced cirrhosis can end up having a problem with more and more abnormal nodules and scar tissue forming which interferes even more with blood flow through the liver which makes the spleen continue to enlarge, and the platelet count continue to chat doctor. the splenomegaly is usually not reversible. please go for regular medical follow up. hope this helps"

"by son has had a really high fever of 103,4 for over 2 days . today i took him to the or . they said it was a uni and that his white cell blood count was low . a also just found out that crones disease runs in my husbands family . would this low white cell count mean my son has this disease ? ? he is only 5 months old .",1,26797,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. low white blood cells (which are the disease-fighting cells in your body) can occur both as a result of a disease that lowers your white cell count (like hiv) or by consumption when your body is working hard to clear an infection. in your case, your doctors were concerned you had an infection in your body causing your white blood cells to fall. they found the infection in your kidneys and prescribed an antibiotic, which is it works, should clear the infection and your white cell count will return to normal. your white cell count and you're having a kidney infection does not affect the baby at all as long as you are treated properly and follow your doctors' advice. my only concern is that if you truly have a kidney infection, amoxicillin is not a particularly strong antibiotic for urinary tract infections. so if you have taken the medication for a few days, and you still have fever higher than 38.5 celsius, (101f) or bad flank pain occasionally iv antibiotics are needed for treatment. i hope my answer was helpful for you today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"i , ave come out of hospital after being diagnosed with hepatitis a and seem to have developed a problem with sperm production . ejaculation only produces a few watery drops and there has also be a significant drop in my sex drive . would this be a side effect of sep a ?",1,101537,"hi, thanks for writing in to us. hepatitis is of many types, the commonest being a, b and c. type a hepatitis is a self limited acute infection and total recovery occurs in most patients. type b hepatitis is an acute and/ or chronic infection and can persist in blood for many years to cause chronic liver disease. type c hepatitis is also a chronic disease and may cause severe liver disease after a long time. research has been done on cannabis in liver disorders:frequent use of cannabis has been shown to contribute to liver damage. as well as this, research has shown that the use of cannabis may suppress immune function and enhance the development of disease. with this in mind, avoiding frequent use of cannabis is advised. people who have hepatitis c and use cannabis every day are more likely to have severe fibrosis which can than lead to cirrhosis of the liver. if you have been diagnosed with hepatitis c, you may have heard that occasional or light use of cannabis has been shown to help some people deal with treatments and side effects. however, if you are considering using cannabis during treatment you should also be aware that it may do more harm than good and discuss it with your specialist. hope this helps"

"hi . my brother got severe pain in kidney on left side . after getting some tests done , the doctor said there in mild fullness of the left kidney but there of of stone . which further test should i get done to get a clear picture of what was the exact reason why he got severe pain in the kidney .",1,49439,hellothanks for query. your brother had severe pain in left kidney and his ultrasound scan has revealed mild fullness of left kidney but no stone has been detected anywhere either in kidney or ureter. this picture of mild fullness of the kidney is always seen in a situation when the patient is in agonizing pain due to stone in ureter and which has passed out very recently before doing scanning. you may repeat usg scan after two weeks to rule out presence of stone or to be rest assured about to confirm passage of stone chat doctor.

"two months ago a had a ekg and was told it showed stone cold normal at the of . a was having chest pains and have anxiety disorder . the last week has been very stressful . today morning as a was lying down it felt light my heart stopped completely , a could not breathe properly , and perhaps 10 seconds later it beat again . very frightening . that should a do ?",1,8772,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the proper way to use the nearing is to put it in, leave it in for 3 weeks, take it out, wait one week, and replace it. during the week you are not wearing the ring, you should have some bleeding that is considered a menstrual cycle. if you wore the ring continuously for two months and then had a new one replaced but only removed it 3 days later, the pinkish spotting was your ""period"", which is caused by not wearing the ring. the bleeding was very light because you had suppressed it by continuously wearing the ring for over 2 months. so you should expect your next period about 4-5 weeks after the episode of spotting that you had. if you do not have menses by then, i recommend repeating the pregnancy test at that time. if you did not have regular monthly cycles before you used the ring, your cycle will follow your regular pattern that you typically have when not using hormonal contraception. if you are trying to get pregnant, you should have intercourse about every other day and begin taking prenatal vitamins as it benefits the health of the baby for the vitamins to be present at conception. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"hello sir first time when i used this sunscreen ( brown colour bottle spa 20 ) in 2006/7 it suited me but after that new white colour bottle came with same chemicals but not suited me and this product is costly 4 me so before buying it , i want a a opinion , what can i do ? buy it or not ?",1,10772,"hello, thanks for asking on chat doctor. it is recommended to exclusively breastfeed a baby until 6 months of age and then start weaning foods while continuing to breastfeed. the longer you breastfeed, the better it is for the overall child development. since the technique of feeding from breast and from a bottle is different for a baby, it finds it difficult to easily switch from one to another. some babies totally refuse bottle if they have been exclusively breastfed before and there's no harm in that. the only thing is that mother finds it difficult to leave the baby with someone else for going to work or elsewhere. what is suggested is to try different nipples and someone other than mother to give the bottle. since you have already tried all this it seems it won't work. you can start the hippy cup after 6 months along with semisolid foods with a spoon. there is no disadvantage of not using a bottle at all. in fact bottle can cause health problems like diarrhea since the nipples might harbor bacteria if not cleaned and sterilized properly"

(as you said he has difficulty in walking now). you can also say to his parents that --- they can continue with all religious customs along with medicines, may be then they will agree... with medicine, he will start showing improvement in few days only... it is psychosis and patients will not agree to go to any doctor willingly, so you might need to take him forcefully. this is well accepted as it is for his benefit only. even if he doesn't agree for oral medicine there are injectables which are given to such patients... take the right step, take him to a doctor. hope the reply is useful feel free to ask more questions"

"hello . a be been unwell now for 5 days . a have an unusual pain in the right side of my anus , the pain however is inside . a be felt for lumps but have found nothing . when a go to the toilet it is painful just to sit down . a try and go for a poo but it a too painful and end up with a brown jelly like substance . long with the pain a be also suffered from a very high temperature , headaches and feeling weak . is this all connected and what could it be ? a can to even make it to the doctors without feeling dizzy or in serious pain",1,33660,"hi there, the backed up stool and tendency to urinary tract infection does point to the idea that she could be constipated, despite being regular. regarding the frequency of bowel movements, do note that different people tend to have different bowel needs, up to 3 times a day is accepted as normal. so she could actually be going daily and still be relatively constipated. what we are aiming for is the right consistency of stools, which is long and sausage-like, with or without cracks. if you need more visual guidance, look for the bristol stool chart online, and aim for type 3 or 4. it is good that she is taking enough fibers, but also pay attention to her habits and stress to her that she needs to go when she feels like it even if it is more than once a day. constipation often occurs at this age because this is when they are getting better at holding it in, and prefer other exciting activities to sitting in the toilet. the other rarer possibility would be that she has a mild form of hirschsprungs disease, which means that some nerves are missing from the end of the colon, making the evacuating of stool difficult. most people have this diagnosed as babies, but if its very mild it can be missed. it might be more likely if she had delayed bowel movement more than a day after birth, or had tendency to constipation even as a baby. you will have to discuss with your doctor on this possibility, because confirmation would be needed with a rectal biopsy. hope this helps, and all the best to you."

a have seizures and have had them since a was about 7 years old .what can cause seizures and a quite having them for 19 years then they came back.i haven seen a neurologist since a was a kid and can not afford to see one and have no insurance .can seizures cause your scalp to be tender to the touch.sorry a know this is more than one question .,1,53368,"i read your question and i understand your concern. from your description of the episodes they can indeed be a case of seizures. they shouldn't be related to the back surgery itself. the eeg being normal doesn't exclude the diagnosis as it can be the case in the interval without seizures. regarding the tests i think apart from routine lab tests (including electrolytes and tests for autoimmune disease), brain imaging is also required as at this age usually seizures have an identifiable cause. also, the eeg can be repeated because repeated eeg's increase the chance of chancing upon epileptiform anomalies. if the seizures are frequent i would consider being admitted to a neurology clinic, in order for the seizures to be seen by personnel which is used to the features of epilepsy and more qualified to distinguish seizures from other attacks like psychogenic ones or syncope. there are specialized clinics where prolonged eeg accompanied by video recordings side by side make for a better evaluation. if the seizures are rare, you live in a remote area and the doctor never happens to see one, you could also yourself film the episodes (with your smartphone if you have one) and show them to your doctor to facilitate his evaluation of them. if the clinical signs are convincing a normal eeg shouldn't be an obstacle to starting treatment. i hope to have been of help."

hello6 months ago a got filling of a upper tooth done for a second time ... now a feeling pain and sensitivity in dat tooth .. even a color of the tooth has changed to lite grey ... and here is pain even while touching or chewing something .. a int know what is wrong with it suddenly after six months,1,78284,"hi. thanks for the query. if you have got filling in teeth and there in one tooth that you can point out to be causing such a severe pain then it is very much clear that you have got the pulp exposure in that tooth [pulp is the central portion of tooth that contains nerves and blood vessels]. due to it the nerves have got inflamed along with the filling material irritating the nerves continuously leading to severe pain, and it is a dental emergency and should be treated at the earliest to relieve the patient. if your dentist is not considering your problem it is better to consult an endodontist and get evaluated along with an iop ar [x ray]. in case if the pulp is exposed the filling has to be removed under local anesthesia followed by root canal treatment of the tooth along with antibiotics like amoxicillin and painkiller like ibuprofen. till the treatment is not completed avoid chewing from that side and also avoid hard and extremes of hot and cold foods. as of now you can take ultra [tramadol] 50 mg three to four times a day. hope this helps. regards. chat doctor. ."

(would you be having it then?) now your cycle is of 30 days period. so the expected date of ovulation should be 07 january. hence, if the conception takes place on 07 january, the due date of delivery would be 30 september. the hitch here is that you should have ovulation taking lace on 07 january. moreover, we have noticed that all the pregnancies do not last for 280 days. the delivery can take place any time between 3 weeks earlier to 1 week later than the expected due date of delivery. keeping these facts and calculations in mind, you may plan your sexual relations accordingly. i hope this will help you."

i a 35 years old female .. i done have any teeth related problems in the past i wanted to ask at the teeth gap bands i have a small gap in front of the teeth .. i have heard at the teeth gap bands .. is it safe to wear them .. wat a the chances of relapse,1,40825,"thanks for your query. i have gone through your query. the gap between the teeth can be treated with retainers. get a new set of retainers and get it activated. you have to wear this for 2-3months. once the gap is closed, then you can get a permanent retainer done on the inner aspect of the teeth, so that there won't be any relapse further. it is better to get a permanent retainer done and this is the permanent solution. these retainers are fixed along the inner surface of your teeth so that it will not be visible outside, and it is just a small wire that is placed over the teeth unlike the removable retainer, where it comes as a plate. i hope my answer will help you. take care."

"i . a a trying to get pregnant and a have just received my pregnyl injection last march 24 which was the day before yesterday . a took progynova last night as prescribed by my doctor . however , a am a bit worried about it because a read in the leaflet that came with the medicine that progynova should not be taken by pregnant women . the doctor said a a fertile on the 25 , 26 , 27th and 28th of this month so a should try to get pregnant by then . a a also going to be taking progynova on those days . that if a get pregnant ? that will be the effect of progynova to the baby ? thanks so much !",1,103365,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, your having symptoms of chronic nausea has no effect on trying to get pregnant. however, your age is a factor to be considered. many women can get pregnant in their 40s but the overall fertility rate is decreased. there is no way to know if you have the ability to conceive in advance without actually trying to get pregnant. however, the majority of women will conceive within one year with regular (at least every 2-3 days) intercourse from the time their period finishes or day 7 of their cycle (whichever comes first) until they start to develop premenstrual symptoms. so yes, it is possible for you to become pregnant, however i would recommend evaluation by a fertility doctor if you have not conceived within 6 months. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

with a gap of a week or two in the morning when i wake up and spit blood cots with saliva comes out . even sometimes i feel blood taste in mouth . today after i woke up and i felt like vomiting and when i spit light brown as if the blood got mixed with something and the color fades came out . feeling weak from inside,1,90134,hi. can understand your concern. as per your complaint feeling of nausea and unpleasant taste in mouth can be due to the side effects of medicines as the antibiotics and painkillers would be given to you after extraction. the feeling of sickness and nausea along with altered taste can be a side effect of either the antibiotics or the painkiller. although some nausea and vomiting can be experienced in case of swallowing of blood as blood cannot be digested by stomach causing vomiting. unpleasant smell from mouth and nausea can occur due to pus discharge secondary to infection. i would suggest you to consult your dentist and explain the immediate symptoms so that he can either reduce the dose or change the medicine. if the infection and pus discharge is still present then irrigation with antiseptic solution and prescribing a course of antibiotics can help. along with it gargling with warm saline solution and antiseptic mouthwash can help. hope this information helps. thanks and regards. chat doctor. .

"70 year-old healthy male . a have insensitive teeth , my dentist can drill to his hearts content without injecting anaesthesia . dentist calls it nerve withdrawal but cant put a medical name on it .. a also have bilateral numbness on the plantar surface of my feet . thought they might be related .",1,49642,hello read through your query. insensitive tooth is nothing but the tooth which has lost its life(tooth with necroses pulp). nothing to be worried in this case. you can go to an endodontist and get it filled by rootcanaltreatment procedure(if it's causing any pain or problems to you). if it's not showing any symptoms like pain be cool and enjoy eating. this insensitive tooth may be caused due to some trauma years back or due to any caries in the tooth which has gone deep into the pulp and killed the pulp. in my view it has nothing to do with your bilateral numbness of feet as you have insensitivity to a tooth. if it causes insensitivity to all tooth then we can suspect bilateral numbness can do something with this and go for investigation for that. so for now be cool to enjoy your life. best part of your life. stressfree and happy mind lets you stay fit year after year. hope you have benefitted something with this reply. have a healthy day!!!

in 38 weeks pregnant with a heart murmur and i can just be laying down .... not moving for a long time and my heart rate gets so fast and hard that i can see my boob moving up and down through my shirt . when my chest starts hurting and i feel like my lungs are getting squished ... so i get short of breath ... what is wrong ?,1,34552,"the only thing for a cold sensation i can think of is acid reflux. when you get heart burn it feels crazy and can give anxiety (hence the rapid heart rate). you can remedy acid reflux (herd, or heart burn, throat burn or whatever you want to call it) by getting some digestive enzymes (try something like source naturals daily digestive enzymes) at a local vitamin store (or try vitacost.com) and till give her enough digestive juices to help grind up her food better. also, food intolerances will cause problems too. i discovered a food intolerance to wheat, milk and peanuts. but you have to write down how you feel after you eat something and try eliminating it for a while and see how it goes. you can ask a doctor for an elisa test (for food allergies) but it doesn't tell us much. a food elimination/rotation diet is much better plus it can't hurt. a sharp knife like feeling is definitely heart burn from what i've felt or heard about. make sure you write down when these things occur, what time and how long (dates) and what she had to eat earlier. pizza is a biggie on heart burn. hot dogs, anything with bad fats in it. bread if she is intolerant to wheat and so on. i would throw in a thyroid (tsh) test for hyper or hypothyroidism. so many symptoms stem from those diseases (difficulty breathing, rapid heart rate, digestion issues and so on)...that it should be warranted just to rule it out. and if it keeps happening see the doc. but sometimes i do believe we have to be our own detectives. my dd has a friend that was ill on and off for a couple of years and saw 11 doctors (hello, aren't they supposed to be intelligent beings?) but no, they couldn't figure out anything. finally, they figured out she has a gluten-allergy."

"i stopped taking birth control on sept 22 after my period , i had unprotected sex on oct 6 , and have yet to get my period , but have experienced brown discharge for the past 3-4 days , what could this mean ? pregnancy or just me going off my birth control",2,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"
"i stopped taking birth control on sept 22 after my period , i had unprotected sex on oct 6 , and have yet to get my period , but have experienced brown discharge for the past 3-4 days , what could this mean ? pregnancy or just me going off my birth control",3,15745,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. first, if you are late for your shot and have had unprotected sex, even if you are bleeding, you should do a urine pregnancy test. if your pregnancy test is negative, many women do not have regular periods come back after discontinuing the depo-provera injection for even up to 6 months. this, however, does not mean that you cannot become pregnant. if you are not actively trying to get pregnant, a good way to help regulate your cycles until your own body resumes a regular cycle is by taking birth control pills. birth control pills make you get a light, regular, predictable cycle every month and will help control breakthrough bleeding (the brown staining you have all the time). many women have irregular bleeding in the first 6 months to a year of using the shot, and unfortunately the same thing can happen after you discontinue it. so, in summary, all the irregular bleeding you are having is likely due to your discontinuing the demo shot. if you need contraception, the monthly cycle birth control pill would be a good option that can also help you have regular cycles. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

a am waiting for my insurance to be active before a can get an mri that has been recommended but a possibility is that a have a bulging disc & was wondering if this could cause severe rib pain ? ave been in pain everyday since about december and it is getting worse now with sharp pains in ribs . guess a just want to know if it would only be the disc causing everything or if a might have to be concerned with more . thanks !,1,56450,"hello, sorry to hear that our team in the medical was not able to help you out. it would have been perfect if you had mentioned the details of the mri reports as we could have understood something from it. if you have any issue with the intervertebral disc and nerve entrapment. now since you are mentioning pain in the hip, thigh, leg and back, i would like to know if the pain symptom is radiating in nature? also, how is the back pain? is the nature of the pain sharp shooting or dull aching. if dull aching then it will be related to muscle but if sharpshooting than it will be for nerve. now coming to an analysis of you, you mentioned your age is 38, so we can look for some degenerative changes in the lumbar spine. due to which there might be changes of back pain and nerve getting trapped. for this i will recommend you to try out the exercise for the core, back and lower limbs on both sides. it is mandatory to do exercise in any back pains or radiating pains as due to pain there is a muscle weakness which gets build up over a period of time and once the muscles are weak there is instability of the spinal column. i wish you check for your blood glucose levels along with uric acid too, so we can have a differential diagnosis made to rule out the possibility because. if you can still mention in detail about the mri it will be really kind of you. in my clinical practice of over 12 years, many back cases associated with leg pain are doing well with conservative management. like - exercise, physical therapy and yoga. outcome score is almost as desired to be. please start the exercise, and you will get a difference in the overall physical well-being. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further. take care jay in chat doctor."

"hello , a am a 38 year old female that recently started experiencing some chest discomfort and sob , a went for a stress test today but haven gotten the results yet . during the test , a became short of breath and some chest discomfort and my of was 118/48 ? is the diastolic supposed to fall during the test ?",1,15046,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. feeling short of breath is not unusual while you're pregnant because the hormones of pregnancy actually have a way of telling your brain to breathe faster. this is to ensure that your baby gets enough oxygen, because as your belly gets bigger your lungs are not able to expand as well. so many women feel the sensation of needing to catch their breath all the time when they breathe when they are in the third trimester. in addition, because you would have been on bed rest for so long, you probably are not in very good cardiovascular shape. another possible reason why you could be feeling short of breath is that there is a possibility that you are anemic. normally, as part of routine prenatal care we check your blood count as well is a test for gestational diabetes somewhere between 24 and 28 weeks. if you've not yet had this test, it might be a good idea to mention your symptoms to your doctor. of course, there can be some serious, dangerous things that can cause shortness of breath; like blood clots that spread to your lung, or fluid in the lungs and other pulmonary problems. if you experience any chest pain or severe shortness of breath or start developing a productive cough, you should notify your doctor immediately and possibly go to the hospital for evaluation. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

"i , a day ago i woke up with a pain/sore on my gum high above my front teeth . when i observed the area , it just seemed more red . it is painful to touch and bothersome . a garbled with salt water before bed yesterday , and i woke up today with the inside of my lips swollen . a section of the gum above two of my front teeth is tender to touch and looks shinier . what should i do ? is it serious or can i just carry on until it goes away ?",1,53390,hi. can understand your concern. as per your complaint the swollen gum and the white material inside it is a result of some inflammation. there can be a few reasons depending upon whether it is the second molar or the wisdom tooth. in case it is a wisdom tooth which is erupting or is impacted then the gum above it can get infected and inflamed due to either food deposition between the gum and the wisdom tooth or it can be due to gum flap bitten by the opposite jaw tooth and the condition is known as peritonitis. the white material in it is pus. in case it is second molar the swollen gum with white material in it can be as a result of infection in the gums due to deposits on the teeth like plaque or calculus or due to foreign body impaction in the gums which carries infection along with it deeper into the gums causing pus formation. it can also be due to deeply infected tooth causing pus formation below the tips of the roots of the tooth causing swelling on the gums with pus inside. i would suggest you to consult a dentist and get evaluated for the exact cause of the swelling and get treated accordingly. in case if it is wisdom tooth either excision of gum flap or extraction if the tooth is impacted followed by antibiotics and painkillers can be done. in case of gum infection professional cleaning of teeth followed by antibiotics and gum paints can help. in case of tooth infection root canal treatment or extraction depending on the condition of the tooth can be done. hope your query is solved. if you find the answer helpful please write a positive review and click on find this answer helpful as a token of appreciation. thanks and regards. chat doctor.

one week back i went to consult cardiology doctor that my father getting the chest pain.so doctors did enzygrome test and said severe triple block vessel ... so i now trying to consult to another doctor is this good decision can doing the enzyfrome test once can effect,1,58987,"his am chat doctor. i have read your message. i think i can help you. first, a package test means that multiple tests are included that correlate to the test. cpk and spe can both be package tests as there are many related tests needed in a diagnosis. the symptoms that you seem to be facing as per the query is basically severe backache that increases on lying down or bending-in other words, anything that causes the spine to be under pressure. now she itself can cause the symptoms. the muscles and bone problems can arise in she itself and thus possibly one will feel that there is nothing more to do. however, in many situations, the doctors may get biased my a diagnosis. so, i think it is good that your doctor did not get biased with your pre-existing diagnosis of she and continued to look for other causes of backache. a severe backache can happen due to muscle disorders, a condition known as myopathy. the cause of myopathy may be she itself. the test commonly done to test myopathy is cpk or creatine phospholipase. this is a test done from blood. the idea is if the cpk is raised, it suggests myopathy. in this situation, your doctor will need to modify the therapy. i am unaware of your medication from the query. so i cannot really comment upon it. but some medicines themselves cause myopathy. and sometimes, the dose of existing medicines need to be stepped up for treatment of myopathy. so i presume your doctor wanted to check that. second test was spe or serum protein electrophoresis. this is one of the tests for multiple myeloma. this is a type of malignancy that affects the bones and causes bone pains and should be ruled out in middle-aged to elderly commonly if the backache is worsening and is specially bad when lying down. if the test is negative, there is nothing to worry about. if it does come out to be positive, multiple myeloma can be treated. so again you need not worry since the treatment is available. why the doctor did not tell you about the tests is something i can only speculate about. i guess it was because these are just doubts, considering you already have she- in medicine, the usual dictum is that one disease can explain the symptom, the other condition should not be sought. having said that, it's a folly to miss another diagnosis due to a pre-existing condition. i think he would have told you if the tests came out positive. so there should be nothing to worry about-the doctor was just making sure that there is no other problem. possibly since there was nothing else diagnosed, he did not tell you about it. i have tried to make it as simple as possible to understand the situation. in case there are still doubts, feel free to contact me for further details. best of luck,"

"early december , i was consulted for fertility test . i have regular period , have history of myxoma uteri . the last test showed fish little too high 19 ( the rest are normal - of , prolactin , etc ) . the doctor then give me genera tablet for 21 days . it the same time last week , i was tested for ovulation , and shows one big egg develop . but now in having period 9 days earlier than should be . that is genera for ? to mature my egg ? why my period becomes regular ? --",1,72620,"hallow dear, the duration of pregnancy when counted from the last menstrual period is 280 days or 9 calendar months and 7 days. in fact the egg is released (ovulation) 14 days prior to the next expected menses; i.e. if the cycle is of 30 days the egg will be released on day 16 of the cycle. the egg has 24 hours life while the sperms are active for 72 hours. hence, the conception can happen about a week around the day of ovulation. considering this, for practical purpose we consider 2 weeks less from the day of ovulation (or conception). so the pregnancy precisely is of 266 days. however, for the sake of convenience, we calculate it as 280 days from the last menstrual period date. considering these facts, if the delivery date is to be expected on september 30, the last menstrual period date should be 23 december. (would you be having it then?) now your cycle is of 30 days period. so the expected date of ovulation should be 07 january. hence, if the conception takes place on 07 january, the due date of delivery would be 30 september. the hitch here is that you should have ovulation taking lace on 07 january. moreover, we have noticed that all the pregnancies do not last for 280 days. the delivery can take place any time between 3 weeks earlier to 1 week later than the expected due date of delivery. keeping these facts and calculations in mind, you may plan your sexual relations accordingly. i hope this will help you."

"i , my left wisdom tooth is coming through but has only partially come through and a have a flap of come now because of it , it a not that painful but this morning a noticed my gum was yellow like a spot so a pushed on it and puss and blood came out ! a be been doing salt wash before today as that a what a got told to do by my dentist with my other wisdom tooth ! that is this ? !",1,5711,hi. thanks for the query as per your complaint sore throat can be seen associated with wisdom tooth related infection and inflammation as the area of wisdom teeth is very close to throat and inflammation from wisdom tooth can even make the throat sore and painful. but runny nose is not commonly seen with sore throat if it is related to wisdom tooth and can be due to other causes like sinus infection or upper respiratory infection. so for this you can consult a physician and get evaluated. for tender gum around wisdom tooth that seems to be due to peritonitis which is inflammation of gum flap due to food accumulation and infection between gum flap and tooth. whether tooth is impacted or not can be ruled out with x-ray. for this consult an oral physician and get evaluated and an x-ray of the tooth will be done.first to reduce infection the area will be irrigated with antiseptic solution followed by a course of antibiotics like augmenting and anti-inflammatory painkillers like ibuprofen. warm saline gargle will also help. once the inflammation reduce then if the wisdom tooth is not impacted then it will be left to erupt. in case if the tenderness recurs then the gum flap will be removed to prevent recurrence. if the tooth is impacted then extraction is the best line of treatment. hope this helps. regards.

"hello dr.samuel n.grief , i want to know what it means when you feel like there is like a knot feeling in your heart and it feels like its twisting its a bit painful and happens to me almost ever other day and on those days i have it continuously throughout that day ?",1,22614,"hello there, thanks for writing in. 1. feeling gassy with tight abdomen and constipation are quite common in pregnancy and can be attributed to loads of progesterone being produced in your body. it is not a concern as long as you can relate your cramps to bloated abdomen and if you feel relieved with passing gas. do consume a lot of fiber and fruits to help you feel better. warm water helps in intestinal movements and helps constipation. i recommend you to pay close attention if its cramps or if it feels like twisting menstrual like pain in the lower abdomen. if its menstrual like and if you see any spotting or bleeding, then you need to see your doctor early, which i don't think is a likely scenario.2. as your pain cant be reasoned out yet, i suggest you to refrain from intercourse till you see your doctor. there is no harm in indulging in intercourse after first trimester unless it's nor vigorous. few physicians recommend abstaining in the last few weeks of pregnancy out of sheer caution that it may lead to preterm delivery as semen is known to contain prostaglandins which can set off labor.3. as you had very light bleeding (can happen when pregnant) and you are already showing, there is a slight possibility that your pregnancy may be a bit advanced which you will be able to know for sure by early trimester dating scan. it will be useful if you can reschedule your appointment a bit earlier. hope this was helpful to you. take care."
"hello dr.samuel n.grief , i want to know what it means when you feel like there is like a knot feeling in your heart and it feels like its twisting its a bit painful and happens to me almost ever other day and on those days i have it continuously throughout that day ?",2,25338,"hello and thank you for using chat doctor. i carefully read your question and understand your concern. but you should not worry, its nothing serious. as you describe, my opinion is that it might be a rhythm issue. someone can feel strong and fast heart beats for different reasons. it may be a simple sinus tachycardia. this means that the heart is beating faster than 100 beats for minute. its normal range in a resting condition is between 60-100 beats for minute. when it goes up you may feel a strong heart beat in your chest and a sensation like your body is beating too. another reason for this sensation might be what we call an ekstrasystol.these is electrical heart impulses that generates in some parts of heart different from normal sinus rhythm. this generates an escaped beat that the person feels like jumping ore bumping. it gives the sensation like a beat is skipping, may experience palpitations or an anxiety sensation that your daughter explains like trembling. this extrasistoles may happen from different reasons from simple emotional stress to other pathologies like anemia, hyperthyroidism etc. so, my opinion as cardiologist is that you have nothing to worry. it is just a simple episode, and it is quite normal in younger ages. only if these symptoms persist and begins to interfere the daily live, if i was your treating doctor i will recommend some examinations like a blood analysis to exclude anemia, the thyroid hormones, an electrocardiogram, echocardiography and of course a holder monitoring. this will help us to document and see what happens with heart rhythm. at meantime, i will recommend your daughter to avoid coffee, caffeine products because they rise heart frequency and extrasistolic beats. i encourage her to have physical training because sometimes it helps in reducing extrasistoles, tachycardia, even making them disappear. wish i was helpful. take good care. best regards"
