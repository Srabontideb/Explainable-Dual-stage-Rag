"i dr.chetna main , my wife is 24 yrs old carrying a fetus of 28 was old.during last usg our dr.informed us that there is mild pelvicalycial fullness found on the lt.kidney of the foetus.can you please guide me about this condition ? is it a symptom or diagnosis ? that is the treatment for this ?",1,34445,"hi, thanks for writing in. the collecting system of the kidney is made of renal calyxes and pelvis. this collects the urine formed in kidney and transports it through the ureter (tubes connecting kidneys and urinary bladder) to the urinary bladder. the pelvicalyceal system is the mouth of the kidney where it connects with the upper end of the ureter. i guess that you have got ultrasound scan done, and it shows mild fullness of the pelvicalyceal system in the left kidney, that is a term applied to increase in diameter of the collecting system in your left kidney. it is not a critical situation, and please do not worry if you do not have any urinary symptoms. since it is mentioned as mild fullness and no kidney stones have been found, therefore(i) it can be that your bladder was completely full at the of ultrasound scan(ii) your kidney pelvicalyceal system is appearing full by itself (extrarenal pelvis) and is an extension of normal appearance.(iii) rarely an infection of urinary system and kidneys (recent or old) can cause such a finding, but this is likely only if you have symptoms like pain in the region of kidney and problems like burning urination or discoloration of urine or any kidney infections in the past.(iv) stones in kidney or ureter can also cause fullness of pelvicalyceal system and since you do not have any stone therefore this does not apply to you. it is important to know if your scan was repeated after passing urine and still there was persistent mild fullness of the pelvicalyceal system on left side. this can also be confirmed by doing an mvp which is injecting a contrast and taking 5 to 6 x-rays to study the functioning of the kidneys in a better way. please consult the urologist."

a have a open sore on the bottom of my little toe . it would appear that it is an infected toe but no pus or swelling . very touch sensitive and painful . would it be mrsa ? my circulation is poor and some loss of feeling in the toes is present . what is going on ?,1,28043,"hello. feet are generally the most undeclared for part of the body. it is in constant contact with the ground from which it can pick up millions of bacteria, one of them being mrsa. note that i said one in a million could be mrsa. you have a sore in the toe mostly due to repeated trauma or single bruise on the foot and have ignored the injury, or you have a foot ulcer secondary to diabetes. there are multiple causes for an ulcer/sore. but since you complain only of pain and no swelling or pus i do not think it has reached the stage of infection. mrsa is not your worry now. kindly give a cold pack and observe for two days. if the pain does not subside it is better to consult a surgeon, and he will have a better idea if it is a concealed infection. even if it turns out mrsa do not panic as we have sufficiently large antibiotic ranges to treat these resistant bacteria."
a have a open sore on the bottom of my little toe . it would appear that it is an infected toe but no pus or swelling . very touch sensitive and painful . would it be mrsa ? my circulation is poor and some loss of feeling in the toes is present . what is going on ?,2,13930,"hello, and thank you for your question. fortunately, you probably do not have fibromyalgia. there are several possible causes of pain just in the toe. if there is a pinched nerve in the lower spine, it can cause pain that can be just in one toe. if this is the case, you may find that the pain is worse with change in position, such as lying flat or standing up. pain in the toe, typically the big toe, is common in a disorder called gout, in which the body has too much uric acid. the pain usually lasts a few days at a time, and is usually associated with redness and swelling. pain in the toes can be caused by corns or other skin problems that look small but feel very severe. pins and needles, shooting, on-and-off pains can be caused by irritation to a nerve by diabetes, by lack of vitamins such as b12, or by pressure - similar to the ""foot falling asleep"" feeling we sometimes get if we cross our legs too long. fibromyalgia, on the other hand, is usually a ""pain all over"" problem - back pain, neck pain, arm pain, knee pain, without another cause such as arthritis. it usually does not cause just one part of the body to hurt - most patients say that ""everything hurts"". in my practice, i start with finding out as much as i can from the patient about how the pain feels and how long it has been going on, and if it seems related to anything else. then we examine the foot to look for anything going on with the skin, check if the nerves of the foot are normally sensitive, not as sensitive as usual, or more sensitive, and then we may check blood tests to detect diabetes or vitamin deficiency or other problems as needed. fibromyalgia is diagnosed by obtaining a careful history of where the patient is having pain, other medical problems, and completing a physical exam including what is called a ""painful point"" exam where the doctor pushes at certain places in the body - on the back and near the joints - to see if this causes pain. i hope that my answer to your question is helpful. if you have any further questions, please check back with us. i hope your toe is much better soon."

(we call this osmosis phenomenon). for this effect, we need to check the blood sugar at midnight around 2am or so. if this midnight glucose level is very low, then we have to decrease your night insulin levels. therefore, the best for you is to go immediately to your treating doctor and adjust the insulin dose you are taking. regards"

"i , a have problem in breathing , cough and chest pains due to nasal bone growth . a had consulted ent specialist and they prescribe medicines to me but problems was repeated after some days . now doctor suggest to do operation . a want to know is this operation safe and solve my problems forever ? please suggest .",1,87784,"hi, cannot say in your particular case, indeed i'm not 100% sure i understand the question. if the bone hasn't knitted together and if the area is not cast, obviously moving around a broken bone will hurt and the treatment is to have the area entirely immobilized and probably to not bear weight on it. then, on the healing, the options are simple, and so i don't know any orthopedists who wouldn't know all of them:1) the bones have to be touching to stick together. this often requires an operation to bolt them together. on a small bone they might not want to go to the trouble since the bone doesn't do much. they might even be considering plain removing it.2) immobilization as mentioned.3) there has to be the stuff to heal them. i had a diabetic with no bone in the area of her nerve pain. the nerve damage is certainly enough to cause loss of circulation and loss of bone. she did not have bone problems elsewhere if the nerves and circulation were not horrible. nevertheless, she had low vitamin d and her healing went much better after she went onto it. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

i need a 4 tooth bridge . my dentist said he did not want to do it because of antieslaw . a have another dentist that would like to try a have 2 united concord dental programs that would cover % 100 of procedure . that is your option if my bridge does not meet the requirements of panties law ?,1,28178,"hello, fixed bridges used to replace missing teeth need strong abutment teeth to support the empty span. how long is the empty span? the straighter these abutment teeth are, and good bone support are important factors. your overall bite stability is a factor as well. keep in mind that most insurance will have a period of time, often five years, that they will not pay for a replacement bridge again. this is a question to ask your treating dentist. i need more details, such as location, how many missing teeth, condition of remaining teeth, your gum and bone condition to give you a better opinion. have you given consideration to implants? if you are not replacing a bridge or the teeth near the empty area do not require crowns by themselves, i would encourage you to discuss this option. you are wise to get multiple opinions. you may ask the dentist to show you models of your teeth and go over any concerns with bridge placement. this will help you visualize your bridge. i do think antes law is an important factor. this will generally determine how many abutment teeth are needed to be included in the bridge. your bite and the stress on your bite all factor into how well the bridge will work for you. you should include an additional tooth now if there is doubt about how well the bridge will last. i would be glad to assist you with additional questions. i hope my opinion has been useful and assists you with your treatment decision."

(regular use of emergency pill is harmful)conception occurs if she was in 10th to 18th day of her cycle(in a regular cycle of 28 day duration). you can ask her at what day she is in and wait for next cycle to occur. if it delayed by 7 days then get done upt to diagnose if pregnant and then the required treatment can be taken. regards"

a am having lower right abdominal pain . it is a shooting pain when a get up and the first few steps a take then it just goes to a dull ache . a have been having constipation and hip pain for the last few weeks . a am not sure if it is all related but it became worse today with the lower abdomen pain .,3,91109,". i read your question carefully, and i understand your concern. from the information you gave, the first thing i suspect is muscle strain. the suspicion for this condition is even higher after you have done examination, even a ct scan. regarding the amoxicillin therapy, it is an antibiotic and i can't find a reason for taking that, but for sure the doctor that prescribed it had a reason for that. i do have some questions though. is the pain localized in you abdomen or between the lower ribs in your right side. the pain is steady, or it begins or worsens with movement? do you have any swelling or bruising? is it tender when you touch it? if it is more localized between your ribs, it gets worse with movements or sneezing or deep breathing, it might be tender when you touch it than probably it is just muscle strain (as i said you excluded major conditions with examination. besides this, the condition how it started (stretching too much to get something) and an acute onset, all lead to muscle strain. in general, muscle sprain can be treated with rice therapy - rest, ice application, compress and exercise. to alleviate the pain you could take pain medication like ibuprofen or naproxen. it is necessary to limit the movement of the torso (rest, but just the firs days). gentle stretching exercises can help strengthen the muscles. pain can be alleviated applying an ice pack for 15-20 minutes 2-3 times a day (ice should not be in direct contact with the skin). for a full recovery it can take 4-6 weeks. feel free for additional questions. i hope the answer helped you. best regards"

i am on the pill admin and have not gotten my period during my 7 days free . this has happened me before when i was on yasminelle but i changed to admin so it wouldn't happen again . live been taking admin for the past 7 or 8 months and this is the first time i haven got my period on it .. should i be worried of pregnancy ?,1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

a a a 30 y.o female . a have had left side ( oblique area and slightly over to the right in between my rib cage and hip bone ) tenderness . a am also occasionally experiencing a sharp stabbing pain in the same area when a a almost done urinating . any ideas ?,1,41649,"hello. thank you for your question and welcome to chat doctor. i understand your concern. well, i am going to try and explain the differences between various origins of the pain which can arise from the rib cage. there is angina. it is described more like mid-chest heaviness or squeezing sensation, that is triggered by exercise and relieved by rest, which radiates to the both sides of the chest, to the jaw and left arm and shoulder. it is indicative of a blockage within one or more coronary arteries and reflects the lowering of blood supply to the heart muscle. an ekg obtained in the moment of chest pain, if it fills this description, would be helpful. then there is pleuritic chest pain. this kind of pain is sharp, stabbing pain that can happen in any part of the chest area. no radiation like in anginal pain. it arises from acute or chronic inflammation of the linings that are within the rib cage: pleura (lining of the lungs) or pericardium (lining of the heart) or both. in this regard, i would recommend a chest x-ray for pleural inflammation or effusion. in case of pericardial pain and anginal pain, echocardiogram is helpful, by evaluating the size, motility and function of heart muscle and valves, and also by assessing the pericardium and whether there is fluid build-up within it, or not. other causes of chest pain are related to the locomotion system of the rib cage: muscle soreness, bone and cartilage-related pain. in the end, stress can also cause chest pain. i hope i was helpful with my answer. best regards,"

"my period was normal in february from feb1-feb7 . in march 1 i had light pink spotting for 2 weeks and then heavy bleeding with large clots for 3 weeks , it finally stopped yesterday and i was to in any pain , but i have lost my appetite . that are some possible causes for this ?",1,8772,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the proper way to use the nearing is to put it in, leave it in for 3 weeks, take it out, wait one week, and replace it. during the week you are not wearing the ring, you should have some bleeding that is considered a menstrual cycle. if you wore the ring continuously for two months and then had a new one replaced but only removed it 3 days later, the pinkish spotting was your ""period"", which is caused by not wearing the ring. the bleeding was very light because you had suppressed it by continuously wearing the ring for over 2 months. so you should expect your next period about 4-5 weeks after the episode of spotting that you had. if you do not have menses by then, i recommend repeating the pregnancy test at that time. if you did not have regular monthly cycles before you used the ring, your cycle will follow your regular pattern that you typically have when not using hormonal contraception. if you are trying to get pregnant, you should have intercourse about every other day and begin taking prenatal vitamins as it benefits the health of the baby for the vitamins to be present at conception. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

(as you said he has difficulty in walking now). you can also say to his parents that --- they can continue with all religious customs along with medicines, may be then they will agree... with medicine, he will start showing improvement in few days only... it is psychosis and patients will not agree to go to any doctor willingly, so you might need to take him forcefully. this is well accepted as it is for his benefit only. even if he doesn't agree for oral medicine there are injectables which are given to such patients... take the right step, take him to a doctor. hope the reply is useful feel free to ask more questions"

all suggest after taking choriomon 5000 in in exactly after what time does the body ovulate and after ovulation till what time can the egg be fertilized and how long are sperms alive in woman body .,1,110430,"dear hainan, in fact the egg does not rupture; what ruptures are the follicle in which egg is situated. after the rupture of follicle, the egg is released (ovulation) which is picked up by the tubes in which the sperms meet the egg and by one of the sperms the egg gets fertilized causing conception. so evidence of release of egg is not an evidence of pregnancy, it is an evidence that you are ovulating normally. meeting of the sperms is another event and then the pregnancy. the follicles which rupture between 18 and 21 mm of size and ovulate have got better chances of healthy pregnancy. the ovulation from larger follicles has poor chances of healthy pregnancy. to have the evidence of pregnancy, you will have to wait till you miss your period. 7-10 days after the missed period, urine pregnancy test may give you the indication of pregnancy. done earlier, this test may give false negative result. the other option you have got for early diagnosis of pregnancy is to go for beta chat doctor test which will give you reliable results even few days prior to the missed period. i hope this helps you."

"a have had a acute case of low back pain which has immobilized me . i was just getting over a cold when i started having symptoms of nerve pain in my right leg and an outbreak of shingles at the top of my right buttock . a have never attributed low back pain like this to shingles , but a am beginning to think that maybe that is the cause . a am wondering whether a should be getting an immunization vaccine for shingles . a am 61 yrs . old .",1,103576,"dear tina ma'am, hi & welcome to chat doctor. yes shingles can be transmitted from a person with active shingles to another person who has never had chickenpox. shingles, also known as herpes zoster, is an infection of a nerve and the surrounding skin. it is caused by the varicella-zoster virus which also causes chickenpox. the main symptom is a painful rash which develops on one side of the face or body. the rash forms blister that contain the active virus. the blisters typically scab over in 7-10 days & clear up within 2-4 weeks. the person with active shingles can transmit the virus until the rash has developed crusts (scab). the virus that causes shingles can spread from a person with active shingles to another person who has never had chickenpox. once infected, the person will develop chickenpox, however but not shingles. so, i would advise your daughter to avoid contact with her friend till the rash has developed crusts. i also recommend shingles vaccine for both of you as it reduces the risk of developing shingles and the long-term pain from post-herpetic neuralgia (phn) caused shingles. hope the suggestion given would be beneficial to both of you."

i a recently took the morning after pill after having a condom break during sex . a am also on regular birth control . a am on the sugar pills this week and am supposed to get my period . it usually comes by now . did screw up my birth control regime ? is my period going to be delayed or come when a a taking the hormone pills again ?,1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"sir , i have a gap in my upper teeth . and my tongue always touches the upper teeth . so please tell me how to keep tongue away from upper teeth . age 22 , male",2,107601,"hello & welcome, the gap between upper incisors is called as mid-line disaster in dental language & is mostly seen in those individuals who have thick labial french. this may occur even with labial french with higher attachment between the upper two central incisors. due to higher attachment, when patient smiles or talks, the labial french is stretched which in turn moves the central incisors apart from each other in opposite direction. another reason for mid-line disaster is having a tongue thrusting habit. here patient moves the tongue forward against the upper central incisor teeth while swallowing or even talking thereby causing bi-maxillary protrusion. tooth goes on protruding creating the gap between them due to the pressure applied by the tongue. periodontal or gingival infection specially in severe condition leads to bone resorption thereby creating the gap between the teeth. if oral hygiene is not maintained properly by the patient, then food & plaque accumulation is associated with gum & periodontal diseases. there is calculus formation on the teeth surface which may harbor the infection involving the periodontal fibers causing the teeth to move apart. thumb sucking habit in childhood is also responsible for mid-line digested. visit your orthodontist as soon as possible. he will clinically examine the condition to exactly determine the cause of the gap & treatment will be depending upon the finding. you may have to undergo refectory if french attachment is thicker or higher in which only braces won't work alone. take care."

"a have pain in user right stoma , under the brest . it is like touching the sour skin . a have some pain in the back between holder braids , just like when you catch cold . by doctor have blood test and scan done , of she surest take pain killer . that do you advise . thank you",1,77921,"most people who have gallstones do not have symptoms. if you have symptoms, you most likely will have mild pain in the pit of your stomach or in the upper right part of your belly. pain may spread to your right upper back or shoulder blade area. sometimes the pain is more severe. it may be steady, or it may come and go. or it may get worse when you eat. you may decide to go to the doctor because of pain in your belly. in this case, your doctor will ask you questions about when the pain started, where it is, and if it comes and goes or is always there. your doctor may order imaging tests. these take pictures of the inside of your body. an ultrasound of the belly is the best test to find gallstones. this test does not hurt. your ultrasound may not show gallstones. but if your doctor still thinks you have a problem with your gallbladder, he or she may order a gallbladder scan. in this test, a doctor injects dye into a vein in your arm. then a machine takes x-rays as the dye moves through your liver, bile duct, gallbladder, and intestine. if you do not have symptoms, you probably do not need treatment. if your first gallstone attack causes mild pain, your doctor may tell you to take pain medicine and wait to see if the pain goes away. you may never have another attack. waiting to see what happens usually will not cause problems. if you have a bad attack, or if you have a second attack, you may want to have your gallbladder removed. a second attack means you are more likely to have future attacks. many people have their gallbladders removed, and the surgery usually goes well. doctors most often use laparoscopic surgery. for this, your surgeon will make small cuts in your belly and remove your gallbladder. you will probably be able to go back to work or your normal routine in a week or two, but it may take longer for some people. sometimes the surgeon will have to make a larger cut to remove the gallbladder. it will take longer for you to recover from this type of surgery. regards and take care"

i a am george ! good day ! a am just concern with the information that a learned from my friend.she told me that a person with blood type a should not marry a person with blood type a or vice versa . the said that the probability of having a child with genetic disorder or health defects is really high . is this really true ?,1,36403,"greetings ! well the friend of yours in question seems to have obsessive personality traits/disorder instead of ocd per se, the difference lies in the fact that the former is a type of personality disorders or trait which is concerned with orderliness, maintaining proper decorum, high ethics and moral values, punctuality, seeking perfection in minor to major things, etc. as opposed to this the latter (i.e. ocd) is a type of anxiety disorder which is concerned with obsessive thoughts/ ideas coming to ones mind and which after initial resistance tend to overwhelm the will power of the individual and compels him/ her to carry out a ritual act. for example a person having obsession with dirt contamination shall develop a compulsive ritual/ act of washing hands repeatedly or washing clothes or bathing repeatedly, etc. so your friend seems to be struggling with his personality which has traits of obsessive compulsive personality and if he is convinced to seek help from a therapist with use of cbt (cognitive behavior therapy) applied on him then hopefully he will have a good change to alter his behavior through altering his thought process. i hope this makes sense. regards"

for the past 3 days a have been suffering from short stomach pains that last between 3 to 5 minutes at 15 minute intervals . this results in me having diarrhoea during each pain . that is happening to me ? a done think it is food poisoning as a have had that many times before and that turns out to be one long stomach ache but for up to 24 hrs max . an you help ?,1,95651,"hello, with regard to your question, the answer is that there is nothing wrong with you. if you last 1-2 minutes during penetrating sex then this is ok. there is no receipt on how long a male penetrating act has to last and this is hugely variable from a few seconds to many minutes. it is true that today the pressure to ""perform as long as possible"" during penetrating sex is an obsession for men, but this does not mean that this should be the norm. the norm is what nature has designated for each of us. we are often misled by sexual materials we are bombarded with on tv and internet but most time those videos are distorting the reality and many performers take pills or various substances in order to make penetrating sex last longer. therefore, no man has to feel guilty if he can not last ""as long as it should"" during penetrating sex. i think that the more you engage with your partner, the longer your penetrating sex will last meaning that very likely you will last longer than 1-2 minutes. also, you have to manage stress more efficiently, if it is possible. if you are not circumcised than this could be another factor shortening your penetrating sex period because it is believed that uncircumcised men have a more sensitive penis head. i think that you do not need to do anything, nor seeing a doctor or turning to certain substances in order to increase your penetrating sex time. if you have solid erections, if you have no problems in having erections, if you manage to perform penetrating sex with your partner, then everything is fine and normal. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further. take care chat doctor."

(search asthma diary template in google images)4. avoid triggers like smoke, agarbattis, cockroaches, perfumes, face powder, and wash bedsheets, curtains regularly. do wet mopping and not sweeping especially if your child is around. clean ac filters once a week. she will most likely outgrow this once she is about 7 to 10 years of age (unless there is a strong family history of wheeze/asthma), so lifelong medications will not be needed. we have seen many child"

by daughter who is 18 yrs . old has got some problems . the is interested in her studies but says she can not concentrate on her studies and always wants to sleep . that is the remedy . the does not want to attend her classes now at the college a am really worried,1,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"that would high alt levels mean ( 88 ) with moderate inflation of ast ( 36 ) ? patient does not drink significant amounts of alcohol , has ulcerative colitis , just getting over mononucleosis . other symptoms are sweating with no physical exertion and exhaustion",1,28200,"hi, i had gone through your question and understand your concerns. firstly, i must stress that one or a few of the liver function tests should not be interpreted in isolation. the entire hepatic function panel should be ideally be available along with the normal laboratory reference ranges for a meaningful interpretation. you have provided only the ast and alt values. therefore, i can only answer in general terms. serum aminotransferases: are of two types.- alpine aminotransferase (alt) and- aspartame aminotransferase (ast). elevations of these are the two of the most useful indicators of liver cell injury. the ast is less live specific than the alt. elevations of the ast level may also be seen in acute muscle injury, (cardiac or skeletal muscle). mild degrees of alt level elevation may occasionally be seen in skeletal muscle injury or even after vigorous physical exercise. disproportionate elevations of the ast and alt levels when compared with the alkaline phosphatase level arise in diseases that primarily affect hepatocytes (ex; viral hepatitis). the ast/alt ratio is not very useful in determining the cause of liver injury, except in acute alcoholic hepatitis, wherein, the ratio is usually > 2 and the ast level is 400 iu/ml or lower. common causes of mild increases in ast and alt levels is fatty liver disease seen most often in the context of obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and alcohol abuse. the ratio of ast to alt may give additional clues as to the cause:- in chronic liver disease with early cirrhosis alt > ast,- in chronic liver disease with established cirrhosis ast > alt. extremes of the ratio of ast:alt may also be sometimes useful:- ratio >2 suggests alcoholic hepatitis, and-do not worry. it will take around 6 months for the enzymes to be normal again. hope this answers your question. if you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. i will be happy to answer your questions. wishing your daughters good health."

"i i woke up this morning with my face and gums swollen i recently had a filling fall out and i believe the gum is infected but there int any type of smell , but in in severe pain which would leave me to believe it is infected any suggestions would help",2,53390,hi. can understand your concern. as per your complaint the swollen gum and the white material inside it is a result of some inflammation. there can be a few reasons depending upon whether it is the second molar or the wisdom tooth. in case it is a wisdom tooth which is erupting or is impacted then the gum above it can get infected and inflamed due to either food deposition between the gum and the wisdom tooth or it can be due to gum flap bitten by the opposite jaw tooth and the condition is known as peritonitis. the white material in it is pus. in case it is second molar the swollen gum with white material in it can be as a result of infection in the gums due to deposits on the teeth like plaque or calculus or due to foreign body impaction in the gums which carries infection along with it deeper into the gums causing pus formation. it can also be due to deeply infected tooth causing pus formation below the tips of the roots of the tooth causing swelling on the gums with pus inside. i would suggest you to consult a dentist and get evaluated for the exact cause of the swelling and get treated accordingly. in case if it is wisdom tooth either excision of gum flap or extraction if the tooth is impacted followed by antibiotics and painkillers can be done. in case of gum infection professional cleaning of teeth followed by antibiotics and gum paints can help. in case of tooth infection root canal treatment or extraction depending on the condition of the tooth can be done. hope your query is solved. if you find the answer helpful please write a positive review and click on find this answer helpful as a token of appreciation. thanks and regards. chat doctor.

a am having really sharp pain in my lower abdomen on both side . a used to have ovarian cysts when a was younger but was put on birth control . a have been off of birth control for almost a year now ? the pain is so sharp that it is even making me sweat . that could it be ?,1,23404,"thanks for your question. it is important to realize that if you are sexually active, there is always the chance of pregnancy, even if you are using birth control. oral contraceptives are, in fact, 99% effective. they are so effective that if 100 women used a birth control pill as directed, only one of them would become pregnant in any given year. however, that is still 1 percent of women pregnant using a birth control pill as directed. birth control pill doses have gotten much lighter over the past twenty years, so formation of ovarian cysts is still possible. i did a study on this several years ago, showing that women may still form ovarian cysts on lighter dose birth control pills, although they usually do not ovulate. that is the mechanism for prevention of pregnancy. ovarian cysts can make hormones which may produce symptoms in women that mimic pregnancy. a pregnancy test for you is in order and your gynecologist may also recommend an ultrasound of the pelvis to detect any ovarian cyst formation. hormone production from the ovary may also produce the light spotting you are experiencing. remember, however, that any amount of bleeding on a birth control pill may signify a menstrual period. menstrual periods on birth control pills are chat doctor. i hope this answers your questions. i am available for further consultation if needed."

"an you please explain the risks of asthma attacks and can they cause a person to get into a state of coma , and if so , what are the probabilities of waking up ?",3,41571,"hello, unfortunately for physicians ""shaking"" is a very vague term, and it could mean many kinds of movements, ranging from tremulousness of the body, to flailing, to arrhythmic shaking to rhythmic shaking and all have very different implications. however, i will give you the most common cause of what you saw. most likely what occurred is called ""convulsive syncope"" which means that when you pass out you have some jerking movements, but it is not considered a seizure. what happens is that blood flow is disrupted to the brain and the person loses consciousness. because the nerve cells are suddenly deprived of oxygen, they fire abnormally for a few times causing body jerking, but when the person collapses blood flow is restored and the movements stop. so essentially the movements are caused by passing out and not by a seizure. likely what happened also was what we call a ""vasovagal reaction"" in which due to stress, emotional response among other things, the blood vessels dilate and blood rushed down from the head into the legs causing a person to pass out. the classic example of this is when a person who is getting their blood chat doctor. it is not considered abnormal, and can happen to anybody. lastly, just to describe what a true seizure looks like. typically, what happens is that a person will first stiffen up, the eyes will turn up into the head with the eyes remaining open. there is often a very loud scream due to the abdominal muscles tensing up and expelling air from the lungs. the stiffening phase is then followed by a rhythmic, whole body shaking. when i say rhythmic i mean that the jerks occur at regular intervals and at the same time in all extremities of the body. the gradually slow down and the person becomes limp and often is breathing very hard. when they wake up there is almost always confusion that lasts several minutes and then slowly the person returns to their normal state of mind. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

i .. a wanted to know what kind of problems arise during census pause for a women probably at the age of 45 or 50 .,3,7918,"aging of the ovaries is the most prominent factor and is part of the normal aging changes that affect all organs and tissues. most women have about 300,000 eggs in their ovaries at puberty. for each egg that matures and is released during the menstrual cycle, at least 500 eggs do not mature and are absorbed by the body. by the time the woman reaches menopause which usually occurs between 50-55 years, there are only several thousands of eggs remaining. as the woman ages, the remaining eggs in her ovaries also age, making them less capable of fertilization and their embryos less capable of implanting. fertilization is associated with a higher risk of genetic abnormalities like down syn chat doctor. the risk of a chromosomal abnormality in a woman age 20 years is 1/500 while the risk in woman age 45 is 1/20. gynecological problems such as pelvic infection, tubal damage, endometriosis, fibroid, ovulation problems etc. tends also to increase with age. as the woman gets older, she has more time to develop these conditions, which will adversely affect her fertility. sexual function is also decreased with aging. the effect of aging ability of the endometrium to receive the embryo is controversial. there is increasing evidence that the receptivity decreases with age. aging does not just affect women, but also men to a much lesser degree. it affects sperm and coital frequency. there is no maximum age at which men are not capable of conceiving a child. advanced maternal age increases the risk of autosomal dominant diseases such as mar fans syn"

"greetings sir , a had a missed abortion at 8 weeks in april a just had a torch levels done last week which showed rubella go 93 and civ go 169 which is positive rest all a negative for go and go a want to plan for pregnancy will dis affect my baby to have any anomaly a a a nurse please feel free to inform all a pros and cons",1,50290,"hi, so you have had a missed abortion and are spotting from 9 weeks. you do not need to take anti d (rho gam) and do not need to worry about rh factor as yet. the reasons are. anti d (roam) is not given in abortion less than 12 weeks. anti d is most effective 72 hours after sensitizing event(abortion, fetal death, delivery , trauma to abdomen), but can be given up to 10 days. also, before you worry so much, i would like to know your partners blood group, if he is also rh negative you need not worry at all. even if he is rh positive but heterozygous to rh there is a 50% chance that your baby will rh negative, and you will not need anti d. it is not at all dangerous for you to get pregnant. you can consider getting pregnant as soon as you are mentally and physically ready. you could inform the obstetrician in next pregnancy, and she could check fetal rh by a technology called cell-free fetal dna. if this confirms that your baby is rh negative, then you don't need extra monitoring. if this shows the baby is rh positive, she could monitor you and inform the neonatologist when baby is born. also take anti d then after delivery if baby is rh positive. hope this helps. regards."

i am 63 years old man . about a month back i had pain in chest and felt heaviness . a was hospitalised and my it angiogram showed 60 % blockage by plaque coronary artery . since then i am on treatment . but i feel still heaviness in chest most of the time and feel uneasiness . pm advise whether i should go for any invasive treatment .,1,28983,"hello. thank you for your question and welcome to chat doctor. i carefully read your query. first, i believe that you know what does a chest pain originated from coronary arteries feel like. this is called angina, and is more like a severe heaviness or tightness in the mid-chest and which spreads to the left arm. sharp pain with the highest probability does not reflect a pain originated from a blockage in the coronary arteries. on the stent side, since it has been seven years you underwent stent implantation, i assume that the stents are patent and working well, since the highest probability for them to narrow is within 6 to 12 months after implantation, depending on from the stent placed. however, once you had coronary artery disease, although treated at that time, you have an independent risk factor to develop coronary artery disease again. i would recommend you to undergo a cardiac stress test, based on the above-mentioned fact, and the strain you felt in your heart area. as for the sharp pain in your left arm, my opinion is that it is not connected to coronary arteries. i hope i was of help. kind regards."

"hello , a have recently had a bone scan and an mri completed on my neck . a have had a diagnosis done by an orthopaedic surgeon who informed me that a have an vulval fracture and that it would heal of its own accord . to far its been about 8 weeks and it still feels just as painful as the beginning . a was wondering if a could get a second opinion . a have a copy of the scan if you would like me to send it to you . regards wilhelmina turner",1,80909,"hi, i went through your history and have identified the following problems; i have not seen your x-rays or mri films, so my opinion of this is going to be a limited one.1. the t7 compression fracture: this fracture must have been a stable fracture, as you have been weight-bearing and walking even after the fall. an unstable fracture would have contributed to new neurological deficits that you would have experienced and not allowed you to bear weight at all. and since it's been more than 3 months since the injury, the fracture would have healed by now anyway. since it takes an average of 6 weeks for vertebral body fractures to heal.2. the disc bulge if severe enough at l4-5 can contribute to numbness over the back of your calf. this would signify a neurological compression. if it was a bad disc bulge or disc prolapse as we call it you would most likely need a surgical intervention. so in conclusion, you wouldn't have messed your back more by this. but i suggest you show a spine surgeon who could take a look at your problems, examine you clinically and correlate with your mri images and decide whether you need any surgical intervention or not."

"hi , my wife fell last night when we were out and now there are two bones ( one on each hand ) popped out between her palm and wrist ( maybe the lunate ) , there is no real pain but they are quite bruised . will they got back to normal or does something have to be done ?",1,70951,"hi, thanks for writing in. to understand the origin of back pain and its connections, you have to know a little about the structures present. the lower back spine is known as lumbar and sacral spine and the coccyx or tail bone. the lumbar spine consists of 5 small bones aligned on top of each other and are separated by small discs which are made of soft material. the sacrum consists of 5 small segments. there are no discs between the sacral segments, and they are fused with each other. nerves come out from the spinal cord through small holes between the small bones. these holes are known as foramen. when the disc between two bones degenerated (l4 and l 5 in you), the 5th nerve is compressed at the foramen and there is nerve root compression. this nerve root compression gives rise to lower back pain and excretory problems. it is most often due to pressure effects and may return to normal when pressure is released. hope this helps"

"hi dr. i was not sure if a cat bit me or a nail scratch because it was dark when i accidentally stepped on him 2 days ago.it was an outside cat and the wound is only one on my right leg , but doctor the pain is too much that i couldn't sleep.i applied only disinfectant after washing the wound.now in worried and please advice if i need to go for injection ( anti-rabies ) .thanks !",1,49269,"hit hanks for choosing chat doctor for your query. there is no need for anti rabies vaccine if it is due to simple nail scratch. as such anti rabies vaccine is not the treatment for rabies, it is used to prevent the disease after exposure (dog, cat or wolf bites involving saliva). the virus responsible for rabies is present in the saliva and nervous cells. so it is rather hardly possible to get infected through the scratch. it is only possible if the wound has direct contact with the saliva during bite. what you need now is simple wound cleansing, a booster dose of in tetanus toxic. so in conclusion, scratch should not cause virus infection. hope this suggestion could be of help to you. feel free to ask further questions. regards"

a just found out that may have chronic kidney disease and a order juice plus from amazon . a am not on any medication because of allergies . a need to know if this is safe . a contacted my new doctor about my allergies she did not get back to me . a was reading about aspirin 81 and how it can raise blood sugar and blood pressure with by beds .,1,10194,"hello and i hope i can help you today. baby aspirin (81 mg dose) is literally an aspirin dose that is safe for child chat doctor. it is commonly prescribed during pregnancy as a mild blood thinner for prevention of different disorders during pregnancy, like recurrent miscarriage, preeclampsia and others. it is very safe and even though it is not recommended to take adult dose aspirin during pregnancy, this dose is safe and also may help the prognosis of your current pregnancy. so you need not worry at all about the medication and its effects on the baby. however, it concerns me that you are being treated with this medication without actually knowing the cause of death of your last child. i do not know if an autopsy was performed on the baby or if you had any tests after the baby died. stillbirth can be caused by a number of factors, some due to maternal clotting disorders, infection, birth defects or complications with the pregnancy itself that may not be helped or prevented by just taking aspirin. in addition, many practitioners would recommend monitoring of your babies heartbeat in the doctor's office on a regular basis (non-stress test) to watch for any signs of distress before the baby is born. so in summary, the aspirin you were prescribed is safe but may not be beneficial to you if the death of your baby was unexplained. tests like screening of your blood for thrombophilia (inherited disorders of blood clotting) and infections (torch liters) really should be done if you haven't done so already to make sure that your aspirin treatment is not the only thing that can be done to help prevent complications with this pregnancy. consultation with a high-risk pregnancy doctor (also called a dermatologist) may be helpful in figuring out if you have a condition that can adversely affect this pregnancy. i hope that this information was helpful and that i was able to answer your question. best wishes for the rest of your pregnancy,"

"i have an issue breathing well , it feels like my throat is not getting enough air and i have a bad cough , and after every little cough its like i need to get enough air , its really weird because i done have normal breathing issues , what should i do ?",1,23585,"hello, i have gone through your query and understand your concern. you have to understand that hyperventilation is one of the least understood anxiety issues. it occurs when you breathe out too much carbon dioxide. while your body does need oxygen and generally breathes out co2, your body needs a healthy amount of co2 as well. when you hyperventilate, those balances are thrown off. when you have an anxiety attack/panic attack, you'll often find that you're breathing incredibly fast, and that may cause you to hyperventilate. during an anxiety attack, you may feel like you're not getting enough air, and that may cause you to try to take deeper breaths. unfortunately, in many cases you did already have enough air and that sensation was misleading, so your response makes your hyperventilation worse. since tingling hands is most commonly caused by hyperventilation, you should start by gaining control of your breathing.1. take slower breaths is a start. also, try not to breathe in through your chest as much. it may feel like you're not getting a full breath, but remember that hyperventilation causes the feeling of needing more air, even though the opposite is true.2. you should also start walking. make sure that you're getting good blood flow. as the muscles work, your breathing will often become a bit healthier, and your hyperventilation should decrease. once you've got your tingling hands under control, it's time to work on the anxiety itself. hope this helps. please write back for further queries. wishing you good health."

hi my name is maya a was recently diagnosed with a partial all tear and i need physical therapy and a brace but my concern is i could not find a brace today one had to be ordered and i have a job that requires a lot of walking my question is is it of to return to work without the brace or should a take a small leave,1,17587,"hello, i have gone through your query and understand your concern. i think they are asking you to wear a brace and sit for many hours. we used to recommend the braces for the scoliosis initially, and it is also compulsory to wear to minimize the scoliosis. usually we do not recommend surgery for scoliosis less than 50 degrees. as your scoliosis is just 23 degrees, you do not need surgery. you can be well managed with conservative management like braces. i understand you may have trouble in walking, siting etc. but it is common in scoliosis patients. if you feel some discomfort with brace, just ask your doctor to change the brace and try another kind of brace. if still the nerve pain is worse and debilitating, then you may go for surgery. usual surgical option is fusion of vertebra. hope this helps. please write back for further queries. wishing you good health."

"hi , i have dog bite 2 days back . a have started jaipur vaccination for it today , is it okay.just asking because all say to start immediately , but its almost 2 days now , any i just got injected . is the safe time gone and in going to die because of rabies ... ? ? ? all help",1,5596,"hello dear. to be on safer side i would advise you to get your son vaccinated again. but it depends on the severity of wound. if it is just minor abrasions then just 2 booster doses on 0 and 3rd day is enough. if the wound is severe or in sites like head, face, neck etc. then the entire course should be repeated. some doctors may suggest just a tetanus injection, and ask you to watch the dog for ten days. if there are any signs of madness in the dog in the course of ten days then report immediately and get vaccinated. otherwise, just a tetanus is enough. this may be the view of some doctors in case you are very sure that the pet dog doe snot have symptoms of rabies and its vaccinated. but still there is a minor chance of risk. why to take even the slightest risk? because once if a person contracts rabies then mortality is 100%.hence, you can contact a physician and let him assess the severity of wound and in case it is a minor wound just ask your son to take 2 booster doses on 0 and 3rd day. though the immunity lasts for 2 to 10 years but still it is advisable to take booster dose of rabies irrespective of the interval between the previous full course of vaccination, because we don't want to take risk with rabies. hope i have answered your question. feel free to contact me if you have any more questions. i'll be glad to help you. all the besting warm regards chat doctor."

"i am suffering from jaundice with my bilirubin total is 1.4 , direct is 0.8 and indirect is 0.60 , can i join my gym for my exercise . if not then why not ? ? ? kindly have your answer and about the diet as well . a am just on a boil food for almost a month now . feeling weak as well.warm regards year",1,65018,"hi thanks for the question. i assume that your baby is more than a week old. most of the babies have yellow discoloration of skin and sclera during the first few days of life. this is called physiological jaundice, and it subsides on its own without any intervention. this is a normal phenomenon as a result of transition from fetal to extrauterine life. you should be aware when jaundice is a cause of concern: 1. if jaundice appears on first day of life2. if the level of bilirubin is more than 12 mg/dl. bilirubin is the substance that causes the yellow coloration of skin. its level can be checked with a blood test .3. if the rise in bilirubin level is more than 5 mg/dl/hr. for this your doctor my prescribe repeated test and then plot the levels on a graph to predict the expected rise in bilirubin.4. if direct bilirubin is more the 2 mg/dl or 20% of the total. bilirubin is of two types physiological jaundice is due to the water insoluble indirect bilirubin so if direct component is high it means it's not physiological and should be a cause for concern. the direct and indirect breakage is given in the blood test. 5. if your baby is otherwise unwell e.g. is lethargic, is not feeding well, has fever or difficulty breathing then its not physiological jaundice because in that case your baby will be otherwise totally ok. you have asked if your baby needs incubator care. incubators are for premature babies who can not maintain their body temperatures as they have arrived earlier, and temperature control mechanisms have not yet been established. the incubator provides specific temperature. incubators are not used for the treatment of any type of jaundice. phototherapy is used for that. these are specially lights that convert the indirect water insoluble bilirubin into water soluble forms that can then be excreted out through urine. as i have told high levels of direct bilirubin are a cause of concern and these need treatment with a phototherapy unit. your doctor may prescribe phototherapy if your child has any of the criteria i have mentioned earlier, but incubator care is not needed as your baby is not premature and is at least older than a week. if you have any other questions i will be happy to answer."

hello doctor daughter is 1 year old . teething started .she has 2 teeth in the lower and one is coming upper.she likes breast milk . hesitates solid food .. i tried variety of food . even crunchy food to get smoothness to her gum . applied bonjela cream . she cries loudly . spits food . she is underweight now . 1 pkg,2,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"a have had lower abdominal pain for a week . feels like a have to go to the bathroom , some cramping also . main is dull . a have had regular bowel movements , but the pain is there . by appetite is less than normal but when a am hungry seems like the pain is more pronounced .",1,87055,hi. thanks for your query and an elucidated history. there are 2 likely reason for this pain. the first one as you have noted is that you have not passed motion for the last 4 days. so the colon (large bowel) is now loaded and there must have been xenoliths (hard stools) due to absorption of water by the large bowel. this does cause dull ache to start with and then the cramping pain. moving around will increase the pain as also eating due to normal reflex of the body for the colon tries to evacuate. another small possibility is associated gastritis.

"i , a had intercourse last night with my partner , my last cycle date was 7th sept . a took 2 tabs of mensovit plus today morning with warm water before food and 2 tabs again in night after food . will these tablets work properly for abortion . kindly advice",1,72167,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. estimating your date of conception is only really possible for women who have a 28-day menstrual cycle. by convention, the computer programs that are used to calculate your due date are working from an assumption that a woman has a 28-day cycle, and that conception took place exactly 2 weeks after your last period. if your cycle is longer or shorter, your ovulation could have taken place on a different day than what is estimated. so really just depends on whether you were with your second partner during your fertile window, which really can start 7 to 10 days after the first day of your last menstrual period and continue until a week before your next menstrual period is due. so depending upon how close and timing your sexual encounter with your second partner was, will determine how likely it is for him to be the father. if the margin either way is only a matter of a few days, you really will need a dna test to accurately predict the paternity of your child. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

a am suffering from fever since 5 days and i have much of vomiting tendency.i visited a doctor yesterday evening and he tested tidal and he gave the result within half hour and it is negative ... but i have suffered 3 times from typhoid fever ... what i should do because i a very much weak to stand too ... a,1,29702,"hi, thanks for posting in chat doctor. i understand your concern. typhoid and paratyphoid fevers are commonly grouped together under the collective term enteric fever. typhoid is caused by salmonella type and paratyphoid is caused by either salmonella paratyphoid a, b, or c. tidal test is a presumptive serological test for enteric fever. tidal test is an agglutination test which detects the presence of serum agglutinins (h and o) in patients serum with typhoid and paratyphoid fever. if the title shows 1:100 or more for o agglutinations and 1:200 or more for h agglutination, it should be considered as clinically significant and indicative of active infection. hence, from the above report you have furnished, it is evident that he is suffering from typhoid. typhoid fever is treated with a course of oral antibiotics which kill the salmonella bacteria. several antibiotics are effective for the treatment of typhoid fever. the choice of antibiotics is guided by identifying the geographic region where the infection was contracted. with appropriate antibiotic therapy, there is usually improvement within one to two days and recovery within seven to 10 days. along with antibiotics, you need to consume bland diet for at least 3 weeks to make sure the relapse does not take place. hope the information provided would be helpful. all the best."

a got my teeth pulled a week ago ... last friday . a still have a pretty good amount of swelling and the right side of my lip and chin is still numb . ave been taking in proven and using heat and ice for the swelling . is there anything else a can do to make the swelling go down faster and is the numbing permanent ?,1,82470,"hi. thanks for the query. numbing of the lip, chin and tongue occurs due to traumatic injury to the inferior dental nerve while removal of the wisdom tooth as many a time the inferior dental nerve lies very close to the roots of wisdom teeth. many a time there can be slight injury leading to temporary numbing and the sensation will start recovering in a week. but if the nerve is split into two parts then unfortunately the numbing can be permanent. pain and swelling after extraction is not abnormal and will gradually improve in next 2-3 days. so my suggestion is to consult an oral surgeon and get evaluated and a clinical examination and x-ray only exact condition of the nerve can be ruled out. as of now take anti-inflammatory painkillers like ibuprofen for pain and swelling and do cool compresses. take vitamin b complex supplements as it helps in nerve regeneration and repair. hope this helps. regards."

hi doctor > > > before 2months my fetus died i suffer from missed abortion when i made the test i found civ and rubella virus the 2 viruses are egg ......... the doctor gave me acyclovir and after month made the second test but the virus is still found ........ what i do ..... continue in treatment ? ? ? ? ? the age 26,1,92655,"hit hanks for posting your query on chat doctor. i appreciate your concern for the cat bite in fact scratch by its claws. it is unlikely to transmit the rabies virus, if any. rabies virus is found in the brain and the salivary secretions of these animals. so a cat bite by animals teeth with saliva is more likely to transmit the virus if the animal is found to be carrying the virus. but in your case you had scratches by the animals claws resulting in bleeding, so it is unlikely to result in the transmission of the virus and hence no chance of getting the rabies. what you need at the most is cleaning of the wound with soap and water or antiseptic like provide and a booster dose of injection tetanus toxic and maybe you need a course of appropriate antibiotic from the doctor. hope this answers your query. kindly rate this answer, if you are convinced."
