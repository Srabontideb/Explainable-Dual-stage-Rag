"hello , my husband has been experiencing for the first time in his life an allergic reaction or so we think this is an allergic reaction . it a primarily in his face and it a always random . it a been happening in the last couple of months and seems to happen only on the weekends , but again random , not all the time and it validates between the left side and the right side and usually his mouth area where he experiences swelling to the point of it hurting . be think either a food allergy or maybe spider bite , but we be tried to narrow down the food items , laundry items , soaps , etc . and it a still happening . would this be another way of his body telling him something else is wrong ? when administering an allergy medicine to him , it will usually go away by the late afternoon or the next day and he always wakes up with it . help !",1,7929,"dear mr petra, usually after an ischemic stroke, the part of the brain that has been completely destroyed because of lack of blood supply does not recover its function. it is the surrounding areas of the brain which will need to take over the function of the affected part. this will take time and especially in an elderly gentleman like your father, it may not happen completely. therefore, it is possible that he will be left with some extent of permanent paralysis. once he has come out successfully from the acute hospitalization he will definitely improve, but the improvement will be gradual and most likely incomplete. eventually, the doctors will attempt to remove his feeding tube and urinary catheter, ut when it may happen is difficult to predict. i would assume that the side of paralysis is left sided arms and legs? this is because his left brain is affected and this controls the opposite side arm and leg function and the speech in right-handed individuals. hope this helps."

"a had unprotected sex three days ago ( saturday morning ) , a forgot to take my fri printer pill on my regularly scheduled time , 9pm . a woke up @ 3 am sunday and took saturday a dose and then at 9pm for sunday dose . should a take an ecp now just to be on the safe side to prevent getting pregnant ? a already took my monday a dose four hours ago , which is the last of the active pills . a will start placebo pills tomorrow .",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

my baby ( 4 months 15 days ) having a loose stool for 5 to 6 times a day and some times the stool was very greenish and also there is a rashes near her booty area.baby is completely on breast feed.what could be the cause that every time she is fed she goes for a stool and starts crying may some one answer why is it so .,1,59118,"thanks for asking on chat doctor. let me ad chat doctor. breast milk is the best food for a baby and there can be no alternatives to that. formula milk like lactose are cow milk based and hence hard to digest for a baby. it may lead to greenish stools. but reddish is not normal, and you should get the stool tested for routine microscopy and occult blood. passing stool 10 times a day is equally normal as passing stool once in 10 days, and you need not bother about it unless the stool is very hard. lactogen 3 is unsuitable for a baby of this age and can be given only after 1 year of age. so stop giving it. i would like to ask what do you mean by normal food. a baby is supposed to receive only breast milk and nothing else till the age of 6 months. in case breast milk is inadequate, supplementation with formula milk can be given, but that should be age appropriate. although it is not a dangerous situation, it needs to be managed properly, and you need to get guidance on this from a pediatrician. visit a doctor with the stool report or post a query directly to me with the report and i would try to help you further."

"i or , a am 23 years old and a have been married for 1 year now . since from november last year in 2013 up to date a have been trying for a baby with no success . after making love with my partner 2-3 weeks later a would have some cramps and always feeling tired , feeling like vomiting and painful breast . a always have a hope that a am pregnant but few weeks later a would see my period . that should a do to increase my chances of getting pregnant ?",1,10535,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. pregnacare conception is simply a combination of vitamins that help a woman have a healthy pregnancy from conception. it has no hormonal effects and should not have any impact on the regularity of your cycle nor your ability to conceive, it is not unusual for women to bleed on and off for even 6 weeks after a miscarriage so the 19-day bleeding episode you had may not have actually been a menstrual period but still could have been bleeding leftover for your d and c. so you may not be ""late"" at all, but may just have not had a real period since the pregnancy. there is no reason to assume you would have problems getting pregnant again since you have conceived naturally twice in the last year. either way, the pregnancies conception vitamins have nothing to do with your irregular bleeding. it is generally advisable to wait to try to conceive again after your first real period-so i would wait until you bleed again to resume trying to conceive. if you do not get a real period by 3 months from your last bleeding episode, you should follow up for your gun for a re-evaluation of your hormones and treatment with progesterone, which can restart your period cycling. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful. best wishes,"

(regular use of emergency pill is harmful)conception occurs if she was in 10th to 18th day of her cycle(in a regular cycle of 28 day duration). you can ask her at what day she is in and wait for next cycle to occur. if it delayed by 7 days then get done upt to diagnose if pregnant and then the required treatment can be taken. regards"

a have 4 kids tubes were tied 2 years ago nursed my son until up to around act 2010 by cycle started in august 2010 a have been having flutters in stomach now for about 2 months strong . a have just now experienced a stomach cramp that lasted about 8 minutes while the cramp was releasing there were lot of big movements . felt like something flipping or rolling .,1,33341,"hi, if you came to my clinic with those complaints i would ask you to stop worrying. many women that start using the pills for the first time experience similar problems. i understand that you have taken the inactive pills first and then started on the active pills. also, you have had intercourse only after your period was over that is about 11 days ago. the chances of pregnancy occurring after a single act of unprotected sexual intercourse are only 4%. also, for women that have regular periods the chance of getting pregnant is more if intercourse occurs after 11-12 days since the first day of the period. hence, the chances of getting pregnant are low if you have had contact before this period. you are also having a sick feeling in the stomach and most probably a cramp like feeling. this may be due to the pills as some females take time to get adjusted and may improve with continuous use and by taking the pills with food. the pills are not known to cause any major effect on the baby if they are inadvertently taken in early pregnancy. since you have started taking the active pills late, i would recommend that you use a backup contraceptive measure like condoms, for the next 7 days while you still take the pills to avoid pregnancy. i would be pleased to answer any further queries that you may have, enjoy a wonderful day."

a have been on alyssa 28 for exactly a month now and a had been spotting for 2 weeks before a started the inactive pills . when a started them a had my normal period but for only 4 day which a usually have it for 8 days . after it stop a had more spotting show up a few days later . is this normal for the birth control to cause this random on and off spotting ? a have also been having unprotected sex so a done know if that contributes to anything . a was having it before a went on birth control and a never got pregnant so pm not sure if its just the hormonal changes going on due to the birth control,1,27194,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. tri-sprintec is a birth control pill that has a traffic regimen; which means that each color pill in the package has a slightly different dose of hormones. occasionally, women who take traffic pills may have some spotting in the first few days after each pill strength changes over the course of the month. this may cause some slight bleeding or spotting when were not supposed to have your period. whenever you had vaginal bleeding, regardless of the cause, usually there is some cramping that accompanies it. furthermore, it is not unusual to have irregular bleeding or spotting in the first 3 months of pill use. both sprinter and tri-sprintec are considered low-dose birth control pills, however there are many brands on the market that have a lower dose of estrogen than the pill you are currently taking. so you may have less irregular bleeding and spotting on a different kind of monophasic (same dose all month) birth control pill. regarding pregnancy, the chance of your conceiving while taking birth control pills and using a condom is basically nonexistent. so i believe the symptoms you were experiencing are side effects due to the new birth control pill. if your desire is for lighter, regular periods, a different brand of monophasic pill may work better for you with fewer side effects. i hope i was able to adequately answer questions today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"hello , by father has been diagnosed with liver cirrhosis and hcc . the doctors were to perform a liver transplant but intra-operation we were told that the operation can not be done as the tumours are more than anticipated . please advise what to do next .",1,90592,"dear mr envy, how are you? i am so sorry to hear about your fathers' diagnosis. hepatitis c and cirrhosis are both risk factors for development of cancer of the liver (hcc). the treatment options for someone with hcc depends on multiple factors 1) patient condition (age, physical fitness) 2) whether the liver is healthy or not (normal liver vs cirrhotic liver) and 3) when patient has cirrhosis, the clinical stage of cirrhosis (early, asymptomatic vs late stage cirrhosis with fluid in belly). normally up to 70% of liver can be surgically removed safely without any problems for the patient. but in a patient with cirrhosis, only 30-40% can be removed, that too, only if the patient is asymptomatic and his blood tests are normal. in a patient with abnormal blood tests or fluid in belly or portal hypertension (omitting of blood), then surgical resection is totally contraindicated. in case of your father, i would like to know more about his blood tests, whether he has any symptoms and also the size of the hcc. based on these the treatment options may include surgical resection, radio frequency ablation (burning of the tumor using probes), race (blocking the artery supplying the tumor) or even liver transplantation (age and previous heart attack make him a poor candidate. please do contact me with his blood and imaging reports, so i can guide you to the best possible treatment - rxsuresh@gmail.com. hope this helps and hope your dad gets to feel better."

"hello , by father has been diagnosed with liver cirrhosis and hcc . the doctors were to perform a liver transplant but intra-operation we were told that the operation can not be done as the tumours are more than anticipated . please advise what to do next .",3,70958,"hi, alpha photo protein (afp) is a substance produced by the liver, normally in very small amounts. but the levels go up in cases of heat cellular cancer (hcc). the ct report is suggestive of hcc and is probably the reason why the afp levels are high. the term multi focal hcc suggests there are more than one lesion in the liver. the most curative form of therapy for hcc is surgery. but given that there is background cirrhosis of the liver, this might not be feasible in your patient. the best treatment in this scenario would be a liver transplant (provided the chatdoctoreet certain criteria). this would not only get rid of all the cancer, but also replace the cirrhotic liver with a new healthy liver. if a liver transplant is not feasible, either because of patient factors (age, other health conditions, cost) or because of extensive disease, then other choices for treatment include radio frequency ablation of the cancer, trans cutaneous chemo- embolization (race - where the blood supply to the tumor is selectively cut off) or per cutaneous injection of alcohol into the lesions. once the cancer gets treated, the afp levels will spontaneously decrease and then the levels can be used to monitor for recurrence of cancer. hope this helps, and please do not hesitate to contact me for further details - rxsuresh@gmail.com"

"a have chronic kidney illness .... not past stage one ... recently went to the beach and began a fever . took tylenol fever went away ... had dinner and a glass of wine ... sudden internal chill without fever . finally went away , but today after returning from the beach a have fever again ... urine is cloudy .... my renal doctor called me in a script for a bladder infection ... question ... could a bladder infection cause this chill or would it be my kidneys causing the problem",1,44716,"hello vivek, thank you for posting your question. the clinical diagnosis of any fever is based on a few principles. firmly we inquire about the associated symptoms the child had with fever. apart from that the extent and pattern of fever, whether it was associated with chills or came at any particular time of the day etc. these details would help us know what would probably have caused the fever and based on that investigations are usually ordered. in case of atv, as you informed he was initially treated for a stomach infection, then for pneumonia and finally for urinary tract infection. in such a situation you have two possibilities. either he had 3 different kinds of infection which presented with fever over 2 months, in which case his fever should have subsided each time with the medication, he should have felt better and then again fallen sick with a new infection. if that is not the case then his fever could probably be attributed to a single cause, with the other two being misdiagnoses. in such cases investigations could give support and clue as to what the exact cause of fever is. mucosal irregularities in urinary bladder is a very non-specific finding and the diagnosis of a urinary tract infection should never solely be based on that. associated symptoms of pain or difficulty in urination along with a positive urine culture is required for diagnosis. if you could provide any more information regarding what his urine culture report was, or what his associated symptoms were, then it would be much easier for me to provide you any further guidance."

a had iui on friday and was a little sore after but no problems . when starting on sunday a was to use progesterone suppository twice a day since a started that a have had pain bilaterally in the groin area and in lower back . is this normal or a side effect of prostrgrone ?,1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"hi , i am 22 & ; i haven gotten my period since november . a have irregular periods , i just started my birth control on may 13th . that are the chances of me getting pregnant this month cause i accident had unprotected sex & ; my doctor told me to use condoms the first month no matter what .",1,19276,"hellothanks for writing to us with your health concern. during the first month of oral contraceptive pill use, for practical purposes, consider yourself as unprotected against pregnancy. particularly in the first week of pill usage, the hormones have just not yet started kicking in and exerting the effect. hence, some kind of backup contraception is always recommended during the first initial month or two of pill usage. right now, you can take an emergency contraceptive pill (ecp) to increase the protection against pregnancy. the side effects would no doubt be enhanced due to the double hormonal dosage.also, your period might get irregular, this is because with ecp the normal cycle can be advanced or postponed to a great extent.use an ecp right now if it has been less than 120 hours since unprotected sex. continue using condoms for the rest of the month, until the next pill pack is started. all the best. take care."

its been 13-14 months of dealing with my period.i moved 6 months ago and finally my dr. here started to do something about it . she put me on birth control ( avalon ) and it seemed to be working then it was changed to april 28. my last period was 3-4 days and had stopped on its own then i started the april 28 and i had missed 3 days the first week and now in bleeding again . in 24 and this has never been a problem until it started june 2011. me and my of want to get pregnant also .. will this ever stop ? please help !,1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

i a wanted to ask a am a 33yr old female and have been experiencing a strange squeezing heart sensation should i be worried its lasted about 10 days so far and the last time i went to my aerobics class afterwards i felt a strange pressure in my chest ? an you advise ? had a cardiogram was normal but of course heart rate was normal at the time,1,74591,"hello and thank you for using chat doctor. i carefully read your question and i understand your concern. i will try to explain you something and give you my opinion. you should know that we talk about hypertension if we have mean value that exceeds 140 / 90 mmhg. a person might have high value during emotional and physicals trees so it's mandatory to judge on mean values. it is normal to have high blood pressure values during physical exercise. but it is not normal to suffer from hypertension and not treat it. becouse left untreated it slowly modifies the heart and during exertion it goes up even higher and might house hypertensive crisis with several side effects. according to heart rate, you should know that your maximal heart rate is 220 minus your age. so, for a 23 years old we expect a maximal heat rate up to 197 beats for minute. of course, you should not go above this limit. if you have a lot of time without exercising it is normal to have such high rates. it needs time to adapt. so, i encourage you to keep training and don't worry about the heart rate, its normal. but keep monitoring your blood pressure and discuss with your doctor if you find high mean values. hope i was helpful. best regards, chat doctor."

"by dog ran into the inner part of my left knee . as been very sore since , especially when going down the stairs . a made the mistake of trying to run a few days after the injury and now , even several days later a am in excruciating pain . a have mild swelling , which ice is not alleviating .",1,100520,"hi there, thanks for your question at chat doctor. the swelling, bruise and the pain will reduce gradually over 7 to 10 days. rest, ice and bandage application with limb elevation on two pillows accelerates the process of healing over first 2 to 3 days. i would ask you to follow these four things. however, by third day you should experience considerable pain relief and should be able to walk with mild pain. since you are already able to walk, any major injury/ fracture can be ruled out. pain after bending for some time and after prolonged extension of knee, can suggest internal derangement of soft tissue structures inside your knee. this can cause pain on movements like bending, equating, getting up from a chair, twisting movements associated with going up and down stairs. in more severe forms it can be associated with stiffness of knee with inability to bend fully, giving way or popping sensation and more severe pain. if you cannot manage your daily routine without pain, it will be prudent to meet a sport physician and let her/him evaluate your knee. also pain while going up and down the stairs can suggest some injury to associated ligaments of the knee. hope this helps. all the best. regards. chat doctor."

a am trying to determine in layman terms what the following results from a recent abdominal ultrasound might be indicative of : both kidneys demonstrate cortical thinning possibly on the basis of renal medical disease . in the left side there is a 14mm long axis epiphytic cortical cyst . the left kidney is slightly smaller in overall size when compared to the right with a long axis measurement of 8.4 pm compared to 11.2 on the right . this suggest atrophy .,1,90580,"hi, thank you for your query. i can understand your concerns. renal atrophy with cortical thinning essentially means the shrinking of the kidney. the kidney is basically getting smaller because the cortical nephrons (on the outside of the kidney) is thinning out. cortical thinning eventually leads to renal failure. you have also multiple small cysts in both the kidneys. autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ad pkd)usually gives rise to large kidney. the presence of two or more cysts in each kidney is associated with a sensitivity and specificity of 90% and 100%, respectively. to differentiate it from benign cysts, you may undergo mutational screening for adpkd-1 and adpkd-2. treatment is conservative(medicinal) and eventual renal replacement therapy (dialysis) as the need arises. regards"

(would you be having it then?) now your cycle is of 30 days period. so the expected date of ovulation should be 07 january. hence, if the conception takes place on 07 january, the due date of delivery would be 30 september. the hitch here is that you should have ovulation taking lace on 07 january. moreover, we have noticed that all the pregnancies do not last for 280 days. the delivery can take place any time between 3 weeks earlier to 1 week later than the expected due date of delivery. keeping these facts and calculations in mind, you may plan your sexual relations accordingly. i hope this will help you."

i . of boyfriend had an accessed tooth and he had a hole on his jaw/check where puss was coming out . the problem is its been about a year and a half and the hole ( with a bump on the jaw ) and the puss is still there .could you help ? -worried,1,44715,"hello, i can understand your concern. it would have been helpful if you had mentioned which tooth was treated for root canal. as you are mentioning that the tooth was black and had cracks in it, i am assuming that the tooth is in the lower front region, and you had had some trauma to the lower jaw area which made the tooth dead and also hurt the chin and lip. other possibility is that if the tooth was dead for many years, it may have developed a periapical cyst in relation with the tooth which might be pressing on the mental nerve supplying lower lip and chin and may cause numbness of those areas. alternatively, the numbness may have started after taking local anesthesia in the lower front area for some tooth problem and the injection might have been given deep. in any case, it seems that the nerve supplying sensation to the lower front area of jaw along with lower lip and chin (mental nerve) is damaged. usually, if the nerve is damaged, it can regenerate in 3-6 months and the sensations can return. if you are not sure regarding the crown on the tooth, you can avoid it for some months and take care not to bite hard things with that tooth so that it does not fracture. you can get the crown after the numbness is solved. i would also advise you to visit an oral and maxillofacial surgeon for the examination of the area and regarding numbness. he/she might take an x-ray to rule out presence of periapical lesion or cyst in relation with the tooth. crown should surely be postponed until this possibility is ruled out. i hope this information helps you. thank you for choosing chat doctor. i wish you feel better soon. best,"

i . a lump suddenly appeared under my left breast . it was the size of a pea but it grew overnight and is quite sore and itchy . a also have felt very sleepy recently and have had a hard time getting over an illness . a have an appointment tomorrow but do malignant tutor typically hurt and itch ?,3,82366,"hello friend, thank you for posting your query through chat doctor. i am a homeopath answering your query and the answer which i am going to give you may contain several thoughts which may appear strange or new for you. this i say because homeopathy is a new system of medicine and is almost unheard by the majority of the population. therefore, due to the high influence of the conventional medicine the people at large are brainwashed to believe and act according to the health education given by them. coming back to the fibroadenoma of your left breast in the year 1979, you had a psychological conflict in the mind level. you are a sensitive individual and that is why your left breast was affected. it must have been related with your child chat doctor. the sensitivity is genetic, and you reacted to the conflict through the brain according to a genetic programming. mind-brain - organ affection resulted in the development of a lump in your left breast in 1979. you consulted your gynecologist, and he suggested that it may turn to become cancerous in future and so it is better to remove it, and you subdued to his suggestion. actually the lump in the breast was an attempt of the body to cure you, or it was the result of a self defense mechanism. since you had not resolved the conflict in the psychological level, the lump remained there without getting resolved. but the body kept the lump protected in a cyst with minimum amount of inflammation called chronic cystitis. by removing the fibroadenoma or chronic cystic mastitis, you were not cured, but your lump in the breast was removed. in 1995 also you are the same person, you are the same sensitive person, and you underwent another more serious psychological conflict and the same left breast was again affected in a more serious manner. instead of recognizing the mass as a defense mechanism, you got the fear in you that you have cancer. the tissue changes also suggested that there is more serious pathology, and they labelled your lump this time as cancer and suggested removal of your left breast. if you could have recognized the lump as a defense mechanism and if you had no fear of cancer, you could have retained your breast. but the fear of cancer is such that it is associated with death and so you lost your breast. in no case, either by removal of lump in 1979 or by removal of your breast in 1995, you are not cured only your disease is cured. hope by this time you have got the answer for your query. both are related to each other because they are in the same individual, same sensitivity, same program. homeopathy cures the person and once the individual is cured all his diseases will be cured. with best wishes,"

hi i have a child with gray matter heterotopia what can a advice me to do ? is there any surgery or medication or whatever ?,3,81040,"hi, as you mentioned the symptoms of numbness you need to be little slow in first getting what the cause is. as the medical fraternity is trying to figure out the cause. also, the cns has two kinds of tissue: gray matter and white matter, grey matter, which has a pinkish-grey color in the living brain, contains the cell bodies, den chat doctor. white matter is made of axons connecting different parts of gray matter to each other. now as you said the spinal tap test is done you need to wait and see the reports. the numbness can also be because of the lumbar spine issue. which has to be ruled out. an mri will put the insight to the matter. most of the time, we have to wait for any other symptoms to arise, as most symptoms are self limiting and are not a major cause. so rather getting panic you should just stay calm.also, you can perform regular meditation and breathing exercises with general physical exercise as it will keep you out of stress and tension. with the grace of god i wish you a speedy recoveryregardsjay in"

"i a am 23 and a had an emergency appendix operation a bit over 2months ago . a have almost no belly fat , but there is a lump above my scar like a lump of fat or tissue swelling , it kind of hangs over the scar or the scar is sunk like its stitched to my stomach muscle or something , so from my left a have a flat stomach and from the right a have this weird lumps thing , a cant wear tight shirts . the lump is a bit tender and the scar has a bit of a rash that is quite itchy.will the lump and the rash go away ? will a ever have my flat stomach back again ?",1,33931,"hi michele jacobi the first thing that has to be done once you find a lump in the region of the chest wall is to confirm what it is. in your case a biopsy has already been done and let us await its result. you're understanding that cancerous lumps don't bleed after biopsy is correct. but i think your presumption that if it was scar tissue it would have bled is not correct. scar tissue also need not bleed. needle biopsies do not usually cause any bleeding unless a blood vessel is ruptured during the procedure since how long have you noticed this lump. is the size of the lump increasing ? if the biopsy comes as positive for cancer then you will have to undergo a series of investigation to find out he the extent of the disease. ? whether it is confined to the chest wall only or whether it has gone beyond the chest wall to other regions. treatment decision will depend on the results of this if the biopsy comes as negative for cancer then there are 2 options 1- if your physician thinks it is insignificant then you need to follow it up. just keep a check on your lump to see whether it is increasing in size and also get it checked by your physician regularly2- the second option (and my preference) is to do an open biopsy especially if the lump was detected recently and is increasing in size and also if the lump is firm to hard (and not very soft). the reason is needle biopsy can be negative, but this does not always mean there is no cancer especially if the tissue sample taken is not adequate. also time factor is important. you may lose time keeping the lump under follow up to see whether it is increasing in size hope you are satisfied with my reply. anyway don't worry. follow your doctors' advice chat doctor."

hello dr. i was informed that my 4 year old daughter has mild case of pneumonia and i have a son who is being tested and monitored for mystic fibrosis .. how can i keep my der from getting my son sick . what can i do to help my der get better faster ( she is currently on antibiotics ),1,93290,"hello, i can understand your concern. the virus of chicken pox can transmit to another person even before the infected person presents with the clinical lesion. as your daughter has lesions now, the virus may have transmitted already to the son and thus, it is late to do anything to prevent your son from getting the infection. even if he shows with the lesion, it is not fatal to life and can be managed with supportive therapy for lesions and fever. as this is a viral infection, it usually resolves on its own within 7 days. in case your son has not got the infection, you can try to keep separate rooms for your son and daughter and make sure that your daughter or any of her belongings do not come in contact with your son. wash her clothes separately in warm water with disinfectant. i hope this information helps you. thank you for choosing chat doctor. i wish your daughter feels well soon. best,"

by husband occasionally bleeds from penis after sex . there is no pain and blood appears to be fresh . yes been told in the past it is some type of prostate infection . recently his right testicle has been tender and swollen . that could be the cause of this .,1,69552,"thanks for putting up your query at chat doctor. i am sorry to hear that your 1-year-old son has a swollen testicle. however, there are a few more things that i would have liked to know. assuming that the swelling is actually affecting the testicle/testis and not any other structure in the scrotal sac, the first thing i would like to know is whether it was present since birth or whether it has developed recently. the second thing is whether it is associated with any redness and pain when touched. the third thing that i would like to ask is whether there is fever or any other symptoms present along with. now let me come to the possibilities one by one. if it is present since birth (congenital), it could be some sort of tumor or even a simple hy chat doctor. that however has fewer possibilities of being associated with pain. if however, redness or pain is present, a condition called torsion of testis may be present wherein the blood supply to a testis is disrupted. the pain and redness could also arise when there is inflammation of the duct of the testis known as the epididymis with or without affecting the testis, a condition called epididymo-orchitis. this could also be caused due to a urinary tract infection or a viral infection like mumps. this might be associated with fever. in some conditions an abscess or a collection of pus might also develop. i think that i have been able to give you an overall idea but if you get back with more details, i could perhaps be more precise. in light of the things i have told you, you might also like a briefing from your doctor on the possibilities he is considering."

(regular use of emergency pill is harmful)conception occurs if she was in 10th to 18th day of her cycle(in a regular cycle of 28 day duration). you can ask her at what day she is in and wait for next cycle to occur. if it delayed by 7 days then get done upt to diagnose if pregnant and then the required treatment can be taken. regards"

hello doctor .... pm having the problem in menstrual .. i have irregular period since 4 months and happened to be only a spotted only .. now me and my husband trying to conceive but because of the irregular period we are not succeeded .. please what can we do to cure this problem ? ? ?,1,78895,"hi mrs dana, welcome to chat doctor. i am chat doctor. i will be answering your concerns. dear, among couples trying for pregnancy, 80% of them conceive in the first year and 90% by the end of second year. so don't be worried. you will conceive. among couples trying for pregnancy 25% conceive in one menstrual cycle. so it is normal to not get pregnant in the first months of trying. is your period irregular only in this month? if so, you can try for natural pregnancy for a year and see. if your periods have always been irregular, then there is a possibility that you are not ovulating regularly. so consult infertility specialist in your area and register for treatment. do baseline hormone tests and hsg for you and semen analysis for your husband. based on the results further treatment can be planned. there are medicines available to treat ovulation problems. do not worry. to increase your chances of conception maintain normal bmi, quit smoking (if you're a smoker) and have intercourse at least three times in a week. take a tablet of folic acid daily. i hope this is helpful. if you have any further concerns do contact me through chat doctor. best wishes, chat doctor."
hello doctor .... pm having the problem in menstrual .. i have irregular period since 4 months and happened to be only a spotted only .. now me and my husband trying to conceive but because of the irregular period we are not succeeded .. please what can we do to cure this problem ? ? ?,2,83431,"hello and welcome to chat doctor. thank you for your query. i can understand your concern and shall ad chat doctor. starting off with your first query, pcs can be diagnosed clinically with the help of symptoms, but still requires a confirmation using an ultrasound, which i advise at the earliest.pcs is a purely hormonal condition, thus affecting women in the reproductive age group, so the c-section would have nothing to do with this, but a hormonal imbalance could easily cause this. the morning after pill has a known side effect to cause irregular bleeding and a change in the usual menstrual cycle, but to an extent equivalent to almost no period without medication, is usually not seen with the morning after pill. this could purely be a hormonal imbalance, and if the pcs diagnosis is right, this could be directly attributed to the condition. the more extensive testing you are talking about would include hormonal levels: estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, rheas, etc.; along with an ultrasound to confirm the suspected diagnosis of pcs. now coming to some extra information, metformin is advised in women diagnosed to have pcs, for two purposes:1. normalize/regularize the menstrual cycle2. loss of weight (in woman who are slightly obese)if you indeed have pcs, and have noticed an increase in weight since the time when your cycles were normal, this could also be attributed to the weight gain. pcs gets worse with weight gain, if you have put on weight, i would advise losing it. it is difficult to calculate your day 1 right now, as your periods are very irregular. let us wait till your periods are normalized, and then calculate the day 1. i would also like to add, that metformin, birth control pills, hormonal supplements, etc.; will all be used to normalize your period. women with pcs require a certain medication to help conceive (camphene), so this will be initiated only once your period is regular again, only once this is initiated, can you successfully conceive. i hope i have succeeded in providing the information you were looking for. please feel free to write back to me for any further clarifications at: .com/doctors/"

i doc . is sex can delay period ? because until now a done have . and i stop taking pills and were not using any contraceptives and my husband done do withdrawal . last month it was on 24th . pm 3days late now . is there a possibility that pm pregnant ? should a wait for more days ? that should a do doc ?,1,49266,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. if you last had your period on september 12th, and today is october 5th, your period is not yet late for october. most women have a 25-35 day cycle, so until you actually miss your period for october, there is no reason to assume you are pregnant. the folic acid and zinc you are taking are just extra vitamins that provide health to a growing pregnancy; these should not affect or change your menstrual cycle or its symptoms. if your period is late in october, you should purchase and perform an over-the-counter pregnancy test. modern pregnancy tests are very accurate and can be positive even 10 days after conception. if you do find out you are pregnant, there is nothing that needs to be done immediately as pregnancy is not a disease- it is a normal state for women in the reproductive phase of their lives. so it is important only to keep taking your vitamins, get plenty of rest, eat a balanced diet and avoid alcohol, caffeine and chat doctor. if your period is mate, but you are not pregnant, the delay in your cycle can have a number of causes, including hormonal imbalances, certain medical conditions like thyroid disease, and even the stress of worrying about pregnancy. if you miss more than 2 months of your cycle (no bleeding for 3 months) and your pregnancy test is negative, you should see a physician for a hormonal evaluation. so in summary, a late menstrual cycle can be caused by pregnancy, but there are other causes as well. i suggest you perform a pregnancy test if you are late, and if it is negative, try to be patient, and you will likely get it before another month goes by. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

by grandma is 77 yrs . old she has cancer all over . the weighs 76lbs . she has no appetite . the radiologist said her liver looks like swiss cheese . the is just skin and bones . her short term memory is gone . approx . how long can she live before her body gives out ?,2,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"hello , a just began taking birth control pills on last sunday after having a pap smear . since then a have had sex 3 times . the first time was normal . the last two times a bled during intercourse . would this have anything to do with the birth control ?",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"
"hello , a just began taking birth control pills on last sunday after having a pap smear . since then a have had sex 3 times . the first time was normal . the last two times a bled during intercourse . would this have anything to do with the birth control ?",2,74652,"hallow dear, trust pills are birth control pills having ethanol estradiol, levonorgestrel and ferrous fumarate. the last is iron to complete 28 days. first two are the hormonal components which give the effect of birth control. after getting the menses, you shifted to daphne which contains lynestrenol (progesterone). both these pills are good birth control pills provided they are consumed regularly. however, i would suggest you to stick to trust. you had sexual intercourse 3 days after your menstruation while on the pills. so the chances of the pregnancy are very rare. when you are taking birth control pills regularly, you are well protected from the pregnancy, whenever you may have intercourse. moreover, your intercourse was not during the fertile period. !4 days prior to the next menses (when you are not on pills), the egg release (ovulation) occurs. egg has got a life of 24 hours and sperms are active for 72 hours. hence, a period of about one week around the day of ovulation is considered as fertile period. your intercourse was far away from this period. also, you are not having any feel of the pregnancy too. furthermore, you are on the pills regularly. so you are not forming eggs. therefore, most probably you are not pregnant. the delay in your menstruation may be due to change and irregularity in the composition of the pills. progesterone only pills are known to cause less bleeding. delay by two days should not be considered as delay. still to confirm the diagnosis, please wait for 1 week more and then perform urine pregnancy test on the overnight morning first urine sample. earlier these tests may give false negative results. if you do not want to wait that long, you may go for beta chat doctor test which gives reliable results even few days before missing period. this should take away your stress. and finally, even if the pills have failed (which is very rare) and you are pregnant, you can terminate the pregnancy safely by medicines up to 9 weeks. i hope this helps you."

"good day , i had chicken pox about three weeks ago and in one week , it was clear for me to start my duty at my place of work as directed by my doctor . but this week am surprise that i have itching , headache and body pain . does it mean i have chicken pox again , or is it shingle ?",1,57108,"hi there,the pregnancy is always counted in weeks from the day of first day of the last menstrual period, even if the baby was actually formed after ovulation that usually occurs 14 days after the first day of the period. this is to make it easier to date the pregnancy. so the only date you need to remember is the first date of the last period. chicken pox this early in pregnancy should have no effect on the baby. it is more of a concern if chicken pox is acquired after the 12th week when it may cause deafness, cataracts. and if acquired after 28 weeks almost 10% of the mothers develop chicken pneumonia which can lead to hospitalization and can adversely affect the pregnancy. so you need not worry if you have had and recovered from chicken pox, because once you get the virus, your body develops immunity to it. hope this helps. regards."

hello doctor am from india .............. my aunt is diagnosed of gallbladder cancer . we took her to very renowned hospital in india ..... where doctors told us ....... nothing can be done ............. cancer has spreader all over the liver ......... we are going through trauma .......... i want to know is any thing possible ...... can we stop her death ..... please help us .,1,16183,"hi, how are you? thanks for writing into chat doctor. my name is chat doctor. i am a liver cancer specialist and i hope to answer your question today. i am so sorry to hear about your mothers' diagnosis. furthermore, i know that dealing with cancer can be difficult, but hopefully we should be able to provide her with the correct treatment. the treatment of liver cancer depends on various factors. the physical condition of the patient obviously is the primary factor - if she is too weak to tolerate a big surgery or if she has a heart condition, then this would be a relative contraindication for surgery. the next important thing to consider is the condition of the rest of the liver. if the rest of the liver is healthy i, e no cirrhosis, hepatitis or tumors, then the size of the tumor by itself is not a contraindication. i have personally removed tumors as big as 20 cm from the liver without any problem. if the tumor is too big, then we routinely use techniques which shrink the size of the tumor before surgery and also techniques to increase the size of the liver which will be left behind after surgery. but all of this can be done only if it is going to help the patient. the best person to judge your mothers condition is obviously the primary physician who is taking care of her. it would be a great help for me if you could upload some of her scan images so that i can guide you better. also, please let me know where you are located, so i can refer you a specialist doctor in your area. hope this helps and hope your mother starts feeling better"

year,3,49272,thanks for your question on chat doctor. complete cure is out of question as lung tumor can be slowed down but never be cured. so we can only give treatment to slow his progression of tumor and give him symptomatic relief with increase in five year survival rate. we can not free him completely from cancer. and in non-small cell tumor life expectancy is less than 10 years. and five year survival rate is 70%. bur if tumor is encasing aorta and esophagus than chances of five year survival is only 20-30%. life expectancy in such patients are less than 1 year even with chemotherapy. so in his case life expectancy is less than 10 years and five year survival rate is only 20%.

"year sir , a have been taking peel treatment for my pimples and after 2nd seating myosin was seemed to be lightly red and burnt . is it normal ? ? or i have got side effect of peel ? .if this is side effect unto how many days it will last. ? heb my skin become normal like before ? els help me",1,4416,"hi! richa, welcome to chat doctor forum, before telling you details about pimples, let me tell you first about chemical peel.it's a very safe procedure if done by a dermatologist, and it can be done even if you have pimples. it works both for pimples and dark spots. the best peel would be salicylic acid peel. now, pimples are multifactorial, and therefore one has to find the exact cause of it. it can be because of wrong use of soaps to moisturizers or any fairness creams which one is using, to hormonal disturbances if anybody has(esp in females). so, a complete work up is necessary in all patients.also, one should remember that it's not a short course treatment, but a matter of say 6 months or so if pimples are sever. firstly i would advise you to stop all cosmetic creams if you are using on face. also look for other features of hormonal imbalance in body like weight gain, irregular periods, facial hair & scalp hair loss. if you have any of these then get a hormonal profile done. in such cases conventional treatment(antibiotics) for acne would not work, and one needs hormonal tablets to cure acne. in case you don't have any hormonal imbalance & you don't respond to conventional treatment, then one can take retinoids. retinoids is a wonderful medicine for acne, provided one gets all the relevant investigations and takes care of all the precautions associated with it. along with chemical peel, this would give you a flawless skin. i advise you to consult a dermatologist and take proper treatment. after few days my website would be launched ( you can get details and pictures about pimples and their treatment. if you have any further questions you can write back to us. regards, chat doctor."

hi i done know if you can help . i am pregnant and my last period was end of november witch would put me at around 6 weeks i went for a scan on 14th jan and they could only see the pregnancy sack and yoke but not the baby the lady said in probably 4 to 5 weeks should i be worried,1,33580,"hello dear, i understand your concern. in my opinion there is no chance for pregnancy to occur 6 weeks after intercourse. once you get the period there is no chance of pregnancy unless you have unprotected intercourse after the periods. as nothing such happened and the last intercourse was done only on november 14th after which you got the periods the chances of pregnancy are very rare. but just as a benefit of doubt a urine pregnancy test can be done to rule out the pregnancy. it will be positive from one week after the missed period in case of pregnancy. and by 3 months of pregnancy physical examination also helps in diagnosis. i suggest you to consult doctor for further work up. if there was any pregnancy the symptoms like nausea, vomitings, increased urination, sore breasts would be present as all the symptoms start around 6 weeks. but overall the pregnancy appears to be rare or nil possibility because you got the periods and you don't have any symptoms of pregnancy. so relax. avoid stress. the delay could be due to hormonal imbalance as the birth control pills were stopped. avoid stress as it also delays the period. hope this helps. best regards.,"

"i . i have a breast mass which i discovered more than a year ago . pm afraid of surgery so i drink mx3 capsule . would it help remove the lump ? last year i got pregnant and gave birth 2 months ago so i stop drinking mx3 but after i gave birth i found out that there are already 2 lumps in my breast , a new small mass was formed . would it possibly lead to cancer ? is there any pill that will dissolve those lumps formed ? what are the symptoms of breast cancer ?",1,80686,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. is understandable to be nervous about having a lump in your breast at any age. you are correct in your knowledge that breast cancer under the age of 30 is extraordinarily rare, however any lump in the breast that is present for more than short period of time really should be evaluated. it is not recommended that mammograms be performed in women who are breast-feeding because the calcium in your milk can sometimes cause abnormalities on the mammogram that mimic cancer. however, ultrasound, a diagnostic test similar to that which are baby got while you are pregnant, can be performed on your breast to see if the lump is the cyst, or a solid mass. a specialist in diseases of the breast would be a reasonable person to see for this evaluation if your gun doctor is not willing or able to properly examine you and refer you for the ultrasound. however, i do want to reassure you that most palpable lumps found in women who are pregnant or breast-feeding are due to some clogging or other issues of the milk glands and are rarely associated with cancer. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was reassuring. best wishes and good luck,"

"hello , a am 52 y.o . white female . recent lab results show my creatinine level at .93 mg/dl . by dr. is saying a have renal insufficiency ; my a1c is 5.4 and fasting blood sugar was 100 , he says a am pre-diabetic , a feel he is being a little too aggressive with diagnoses ?",1,20500,"welcome to chat doctor. i am chat doctor. normal value of random blood sugar should be less than 140 mg/dl. if the level of sugar is between 140 mg/dl and 200 mg/dl, the patient is diagnosed with prediabetes. if the level exceeds 200 mg/dl, then the patient is diagnosed with diabetes. fasting blood sugar (8 hrs fasting is required)- it is the first test performed to diagnose diabetes. the normal range for people with no diabetes is lower than 100 milligrams of glucose per deciliter of blood (mg/dl). if the level of glucose in the blood is between 100 mg/dl and 125 mg/dl, this indicates that the patient has a condition known as prediabetes. my dear friend, i advise you for fbs, ppbs and urine test if you are suspecting diabetes. she should start daily brisk walking for 30 minutes and decrease fatty foods. thanx for query."

"hi i am 22 years old . i just got sick the beginning of january . ever since then i am feeling faint , dizzy i cant stand very long and i feel something is sitting on my chest . a couple weeks ago i had a very rapid heart beat it felt like a mini heart attack . my heart was pounding i got light headed , dizzy , was shaking , got hot and cold flashes . ever since then live been having heart or chest problems , what is wrong with me ? of and the sick thing i got was only coughing and a very sore throat with a fever . my doc want sure what it was , gave me pills that didst work .",1,34552,"the only thing for a cold sensation i can think of is acid reflux. when you get heart burn it feels crazy and can give anxiety (hence the rapid heart rate). you can remedy acid reflux (herd, or heart burn, throat burn or whatever you want to call it) by getting some digestive enzymes (try something like source naturals daily digestive enzymes) at a local vitamin store (or try vitacost.com) and till give her enough digestive juices to help grind up her food better. also, food intolerances will cause problems too. i discovered a food intolerance to wheat, milk and peanuts. but you have to write down how you feel after you eat something and try eliminating it for a while and see how it goes. you can ask a doctor for an elisa test (for food allergies) but it doesn't tell us much. a food elimination/rotation diet is much better plus it can't hurt. a sharp knife like feeling is definitely heart burn from what i've felt or heard about. make sure you write down when these things occur, what time and how long (dates) and what she had to eat earlier. pizza is a biggie on heart burn. hot dogs, anything with bad fats in it. bread if she is intolerant to wheat and so on. i would throw in a thyroid (tsh) test for hyper or hypothyroidism. so many symptoms stem from those diseases (difficulty breathing, rapid heart rate, digestion issues and so on)...that it should be warranted just to rule it out. and if it keeps happening see the doc. but sometimes i do believe we have to be our own detectives. my dd has a friend that was ill on and off for a couple of years and saw 11 doctors (hello, aren't they supposed to be intelligent beings?) but no, they couldn't figure out anything. finally, they figured out she has a gluten-allergy."

a have pain in the lower portion of my right back extending to my right side a little bit . a did a urine test and there are no infections . a also do not recall doing any activity that could have caused a strained muscle . the pain is really bad when a lay down in bed and try to turn over .,1,78847,"hello, thanks for your query. reduce the level of activity that caused the lower right back pain. because it is in your right side, be careful not to favor your right side more than the left. this is a bad habit and will lead to more injury in the future as it creates an unnatural balance of muscle. do not lie in bed for more than 48 hours as you will begin to weaken the muscles and increase the chances of recurring lower right back pain. try to continue with your non-strenuous daily activities if possible. you can apply ice for the first 24 to 48 hours if there is swelling. after ice treatment, or if there is no swelling, apply heat in order to increase blood flow to the painful area. tylenol should be your first choice for pain medication. if tylenol is not available, try other anti-inflammatory medication. start light stretching and exercise after a few days. if your fear of re-injury is preventing you from performing normal functions, make an appointment to see a specialist. i do hope that you have found something helpful, and i will be glad to answer any further query. take care"

"pm a 28 y/o female , given birth to four children , my fiance and a are trying to conceive a child . be has no children and we would really like to have a baby together , we have been trying for 2 years to get pregnant and haven been able to , what can we do ? should we be worried ? that could be the problem ?",1,43820,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, i want to reassure you that no matter what your endometrial measurement may be, 80% of couples will conceive within one year naturally. couples are not diagnosed as infertile until you have been trying and been unable to become pregnant for over one year. endometrial thickness is really only relevant in the context of couples trying to get pregnant through in vitro fertilization. the thickness of your uterine lining is somewhat related to your estrogen levels. when couples are undergoing ivf, treating with additional estrogen can thicken the uterine lining. however, because you've been only trying to get pregnant for four months, your endometrial lining may have absolutely nothing to do with the reason why you have not yet conceived. furthermore, unless your husbands' sperm count has been shown to be decreased, magazine should not have any effect on fertility nor should affect any health of a developing baby should you conceive. medications taken during pregnancy by the mother can affect the fetus, but not any medication taken by the father, because medication cannot be transmitted before fertilization through sperm. so unless the medication causes the sperm count to be low or abnormal, there is no medical reason why your husband needs to be off his medication for colitis in order for you and need to conceive successfully. i suggest that if he needs the medication for his health that he continue to take it. as for is maximizing your chance of healthy pregnancy, the best thing you can do is get plenty of sleep, eat a well-balanced diet, take prenatal vitamins, and tried to have regular(at least 2 to 3 days a week) unprotected intercourse from the time your menstrual period finishes until you begin to feel premenstrual symptoms. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and i wish you and your husband the best of luck in conceiving. best wishes,"
