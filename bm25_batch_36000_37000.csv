(the amount of platelets in the bloodstream is reduced because the spleen is busy trapping them). so usually people with cirrhosis end up having a problem with portal hypertension and an enlarged spleen, and a reduced platelet count in the bloodstream. as time goes by, the liver may try to repair itself by growing new cells. if there is a lot of scar tissue already present the new cells grow between scar tissue (and result in abnormal nodules). the nodules and scar tissue further interfere with blood flow through the liver. so over time people with advanced cirrhosis can end up having a problem with more and more abnormal nodules and scar tissue forming which interferes even more with blood flow through the liver which makes the spleen continue to enlarge, and the platelet count continue to chat doctor. the splenomegaly is usually not reversible. please go for regular medical follow up. hope this helps"

by grandson is suffering from soothing and has loose motion one doctor has suggested of suspension a there is different opinion that it is not to be given my grand is 1year7 month old loose motion is not in control kindly plus advice that the above medicine can be given to him,2,70703,your child could have got a gastrointestinal infection which is the likely cause of his loose motion. it is also possible that he is still not used to the new kind of food and hence the passage of loose stools. the bubbles are due to bacterial degradation of undigested food in the intestines and hence support this fact. let me assure you that the child can pass stool after every feed due to a phenomenon called gastronomic reflex which is absolutely normal and there is nothing to be worried about. zinconia or zinc supplements help in the repair of the thin inner lining of the intestines (intestinal epithelium) which gets damaged during episodes of loose stools and hence needs to be given for a few days. enterogermina contains beneficial bacteria that reside in our intestines and may help in controlling the loose stools.

i was supposed to start my period today it has been 28 days and i am regular and have not started i had this brownish spotting yesterday and it only lasted for that day and now today there is nothing could i be pregnant ? or could it have anything to do with me just getting over a uni ?,1,10535,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. pregnacare conception is simply a combination of vitamins that help a woman have a healthy pregnancy from conception. it has no hormonal effects and should not have any impact on the regularity of your cycle nor your ability to conceive, it is not unusual for women to bleed on and off for even 6 weeks after a miscarriage so the 19-day bleeding episode you had may not have actually been a menstrual period but still could have been bleeding leftover for your d and c. so you may not be ""late"" at all, but may just have not had a real period since the pregnancy. there is no reason to assume you would have problems getting pregnant again since you have conceived naturally twice in the last year. either way, the pregnancies conception vitamins have nothing to do with your irregular bleeding. it is generally advisable to wait to try to conceive again after your first real period-so i would wait until you bleed again to resume trying to conceive. if you do not get a real period by 3 months from your last bleeding episode, you should follow up for your gun for a re-evaluation of your hormones and treatment with progesterone, which can restart your period cycling. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful. best wishes,"

i for the last 4-5 days my 16 month old daughter has had very strong smellington nappies ( they smell like poo ) all day and night . a change her quiet often and they all smell . the has to done an actual bowel movement in three days until 10minutes ago and it was very very runny . the is also very tired and lethargic but is still sleeping her normal times and she has had a slight temp the last 2 days.if a could help or give me an idea or what might be happening that would be great . a am going to take her to the bush nurse tomorrow,1,33660,"hi there, the backed up stool and tendency to urinary tract infection does point to the idea that she could be constipated, despite being regular. regarding the frequency of bowel movements, do note that different people tend to have different bowel needs, up to 3 times a day is accepted as normal. so she could actually be going daily and still be relatively constipated. what we are aiming for is the right consistency of stools, which is long and sausage-like, with or without cracks. if you need more visual guidance, look for the bristol stool chart online, and aim for type 3 or 4. it is good that she is taking enough fibers, but also pay attention to her habits and stress to her that she needs to go when she feels like it even if it is more than once a day. constipation often occurs at this age because this is when they are getting better at holding it in, and prefer other exciting activities to sitting in the toilet. the other rarer possibility would be that she has a mild form of hirschsprungs disease, which means that some nerves are missing from the end of the colon, making the evacuating of stool difficult. most people have this diagnosed as babies, but if its very mild it can be missed. it might be more likely if she had delayed bowel movement more than a day after birth, or had tendency to constipation even as a baby. you will have to discuss with your doctor on this possibility, because confirmation would be needed with a rectal biopsy. hope this helps, and all the best to you."

we took my 6 yr. old grandson to the hospital sunday morning . he was diagnosed with phenom . they also took essays of his chest and stomach area . they found an enlarged spleen . we are waiting to hear from doctors what our next step is.rob . yyyy @ yyyy,1,49920,"hello and thank you for using chat doctor. i carefully read your question and i understand your concern. i will try to explain you something and give you my opinion. in our daily practice we meet every day with patients with history of chest pain. typical heart chest pain have some characteristics. they are retro-sternal pains likes quizzing, tightness or heaviness. they may irradiate to both arms, jaw and last from 5-20 minutes. when we deal with a patient with chest pain, according to his symptoms we have to do some examination like an electrocardiogram, cardiac enzymes to exclude a heart attack and the most important one ernogometry. i think that your father has done this examination. it is an examination that tries to identify problems with coronary heart disease. it doesn't make a diagnosis of how many arteries are occluded, it only rises a doubt thought electrocardiogram changes. then the diagnosis is made through coronary angiography. so, if your father has already done an ergometer that results with problems than the next step is angiography to make the definite diagnosis. if we already have an ergometer with problem sit is contraindicated to repeat it. becouse this means to expose the patient to a potential risc during extreme exertion. so, my opinion is that the trigonometry should not be repeated if it has problems the first time. the maximum you can do is to discuss its results with another cardiologist for a second opinion if you are not sure. hope i was helpful. wish your father good health. best regards."

"a am a 61 years old with heart problem and a am taking the following medicines ... aspirin , corversyl and poker . by question is .. is it safe for me to take of wonder which is to treat of ? a would appreciate any help you can provide.mario costiniano , saudi arabia",1,10194,"hello and i hope i can help you today. baby aspirin (81 mg dose) is literally an aspirin dose that is safe for child chat doctor. it is commonly prescribed during pregnancy as a mild blood thinner for prevention of different disorders during pregnancy, like recurrent miscarriage, preeclampsia and others. it is very safe and even though it is not recommended to take adult dose aspirin during pregnancy, this dose is safe and also may help the prognosis of your current pregnancy. so you need not worry at all about the medication and its effects on the baby. however, it concerns me that you are being treated with this medication without actually knowing the cause of death of your last child. i do not know if an autopsy was performed on the baby or if you had any tests after the baby died. stillbirth can be caused by a number of factors, some due to maternal clotting disorders, infection, birth defects or complications with the pregnancy itself that may not be helped or prevented by just taking aspirin. in addition, many practitioners would recommend monitoring of your babies heartbeat in the doctor's office on a regular basis (non-stress test) to watch for any signs of distress before the baby is born. so in summary, the aspirin you were prescribed is safe but may not be beneficial to you if the death of your baby was unexplained. tests like screening of your blood for thrombophilia (inherited disorders of blood clotting) and infections (torch liters) really should be done if you haven't done so already to make sure that your aspirin treatment is not the only thing that can be done to help prevent complications with this pregnancy. consultation with a high-risk pregnancy doctor (also called a dermatologist) may be helpful in figuring out if you have a condition that can adversely affect this pregnancy. i hope that this information was helpful and that i was able to answer your question. best wishes for the rest of your pregnancy,"

for about the past ten years a have been experiencing sudden episodes of syncope followed by headaches with no warning also these episodes have become more frequent . there is also dizziness and fatigue lot of weight loss in the last six months and the doctors think the cause may be from shrinkage of the brain at a much greater speed than normal.there are also other symptoms such as loss of motor skills at times slurred speech numbness of left arm and leg cramps .,1,23106,"hi, i am chat doctor. i have read your message. i think i can help you. the symptoms of the query are quite suggestive of a stroke. the sudden onset of the symptoms, the motor weakness, the swallowing and speaking difficulty, the shaking of hands. all symptoms are suggestive of the diagnosis of stroke. the fact that he had been having similar episodes over the last 3 months is suggestive of mini strokes that we call tia medically. these are usually warning signs of an impending stroke. i am unaware from the query about the duration of the symptoms. within 4 to 8 hours onset should be treated urgently and should be visiting an emr as soon as possible. he will need urgent treatment. if it is more than that, he needs to meet a neurologist who will probably perform a cat scan of the brain with or without the angiogram (depending on the protocol of the hospital). as per the report of the cat scan, medicines may be initiated. i think a low dose statin and antiplatelet should help. i would suggest a scan prior to the initiation of the medicines because the closest differential is a possible cerebral hemorrhage (less likely in view of the mini strokes) where these medicines are not to be given. meanwhile, i think you should start him on physiotherapy for the motor weakness. another chance i want to consider here is possible diabetes and hypoglycemia attacks. if the gp has thought about this as a possibility and tested sugars, there is probably nothing to worry about. otherwise, hypoglycemia in a diabetic patient would explain the brief episodes. and a hypoglycemia can also explain the prolonged symptoms. in such a case, sugars need to be well monitored. the third possibility i need to consider is a vasculitis. this is a common cause of stroke, but usually is thought of in young patients. the last 2 causes i have considered in the view of preexisting foot ulcers which cannot be explained by tia or current stroke as the ulcers predate the stroke. i think you need to get the scan and meet up with a neurologist. unfortunately, as explained, i cannot suggest medications without the scan. i have tried to make it as simple as possible. please feel free to contact me for any further clarification. best of luck,"

"hi , i am 38 years old and have a heart condition , i have a pacemaker fitted and have been offered a a node ablation as my symptoms are still a big problem . i had a massive hole in my heart fixed when i was 5 and have been told that this could create a problem when having the a node ablation and i have been told that i could develop heart failure and will have further heart problems later on . please could you tell me the risks involved in having the a node and what happens if it dose not work , many thanks",1,75821,"hello and thank you for using chat doctor. i carefully read your question and i totally understand your concern. i will try to explain you something and give you my opinion. as you explain, you have been told that your father needs a pacemaker. if it is so, this means that his heart has a rhythm problem. this rhythm problem is called heart block. normally the heart beats are generated from the electrical system of the heart. the electrical impulse passes throw the heart and makes the heart to contract and work normally. there are pathologies of this electrical system, like heart block. this means that the heart fails to generate the normal electrical impulse, or the impulse is blocked somewhere and doesn't pass normally throw the heart. this means that the heart makes a pause electrically and this alter her normal mechanical function, her normal contraction. the person having this pathology might lose senses because of this heart pause. the fist way to diagnose this pathology is through the electrocardiogram. it might show this rhythm problem called heart block. the second way is through the patient symptom. as i previously told, the person might experience syncope, loosing sens, dizziness, feeling tired. to verify a rhythm problem sometimes is recommended a holder rhythm for 24 h. so, we can understand if it is a problem through electrocardiogram, holder monitoring or patient symptoms, making this together. if a serious heart bloc is diagnosed, its treatment is heart pacemaker. this is a kind of heart safe battery, that start to function when the electrical heart system doesn't or makes this kind of block. it is putted through a minimal surgery in the upper part of the thorax, like a pocket under the skin. so, if the doctors has told you that he needs a pacemaker, they might have diagnosed it through the electrocardiogram. you should not worry, every think goes fine after pacemaker implantation. hope i was helpful. best regards."

(regular use of emergency pill is harmful)conception occurs if she was in 10th to 18th day of her cycle(in a regular cycle of 28 day duration). you can ask her at what day she is in and wait for next cycle to occur. if it delayed by 7 days then get done upt to diagnose if pregnant and then the required treatment can be taken. regards"

i am 56 years old i have a feeling of being full all the time and if i eat i feel fuller and i have a hard time breathing my stomach sticks out you can tell i am bloated and feeling full even a some what of a bowel movement i still feel full thank you,1,77258,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the sensation of feeling something stuck in your throat is a symptom of reflux-when the food that you eat or the acid in your stomach can back up and irritate it. this is common when you have a large belly at full term because your stomach is being pushed up towards your chest and also the hormones from the pregnancy cause the top opening of your stomach that connects to your esophagus to be looser, so food and acid can leak more easily. the best way to try to control this is to eat only small amounts at one time and to make sure you sit up for at least 2 hours after meals. taking antacids, which for the most part are all safe during pregnancy, can also help. trying to cough up what you feel in your throat will not help because there is not actually something solid coming up. these symptoms may be difficult to treat, but the good news is the symptoms will get better after you have the baby. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

a was diagnosed with light insanity schizophrenia and sadism but with self control i never harmed anyone last week someone ran into me and i hit my head really hard and now its all gone the voices the urges to kill all of it i know it should like a good thing but i can not handle it its like in someone else and its scary i done know what to do .,1,15522,"hello, welcome to chat doctor. thanks for posting your question at this forum. we understand your concern. i am chat doctor psychiatry from india. i will guide you about your daughters' health. whatever information you have given here about your daughter, point towards a serious long-lasting mental illness of psychosis like schizophrenia. i must explain you in simpler way. schizophrenia is a psychotic illness in which the person has abnormal perception, absurd thinking, decline of higher mental function, deterioration in social and occupational functioning and significant personal sufferings for years. the patient may claim to hear unusual voices which others deny hearing. this is called auditory hallucination. initially the voices come for a short period and the person feels strange and does not understand what to do. he/ she gradually may start believing on those voices as frequency and intensity of voices increases with passage of time. often these voices comment/discuss derogatory about the person and sometimes these may suggest or command the person to do certain act. sometimes the person may harm herself/ himself sunder the influence of these voices. as you have experienced, she has a self-talking behavior since last many years, has harmed herself once and now she is claiming a clear two-way conversation with that voice. it appears that she is having auditory hallucination(auditory hallucination is one of the commonest symptoms in psychosis like schizophrenia), and apparently these voices are unpleasant or commanding in nature that might have provoked the episode of self harm in the past. since the onset of symptoms is in childhood and has been continuing for years it shows poor awareness of caregiver about the symptoms of illness. it is never too late. you must consult a good child and adolescent psychiatrist and encourage your daughter to discuss her symptoms honestly so that the diagnosis can be finalized. if i had been her doctor, i would have advice her for brain imaging, certain other investigations, to take some antipsychotic medicines under supervision of a family member and to attend psycho-educative classes regularly. medicines and supportive therapy can bring remission to illness. hope this has helped you. i wish you all the best."

(aneurysm is fixed and can not be moved).it is most probably a condition called a mesenteric cyst (mesentery is a membrane from which small intestines are supported and give supply of blood and return of the blood and lymph). the history you have provided is more near this diagnosis. i would advise undergoing an ultrasonography and color doppler examination to confirm the diagnosis, see for the blood vessels. a ct scan may be needed to confirm the diagnosis and the nature and cause of this cyst. this can be cured by surgery."

one week ago a had tooth # 19 prepared for a crown . the tooth had a large filling which was old and chipped.the procedure went fine . the injection of aesthetic took a long time to wear off - about 4 hours . when it did wear off a had a tremor in my lower lip . the tremor lasted for about 2 - 3 days . it then began to improve but it is not completely gone yet . it has now been 7 days . is this caused from the injection ? now long will it take to go away ? a have called my dentist office twice - he has not called me back . thank you .,1,44715,"hello, i can understand your concern. it would have been helpful if you had mentioned which tooth was treated for root canal. as you are mentioning that the tooth was black and had cracks in it, i am assuming that the tooth is in the lower front region, and you had had some trauma to the lower jaw area which made the tooth dead and also hurt the chin and lip. other possibility is that if the tooth was dead for many years, it may have developed a periapical cyst in relation with the tooth which might be pressing on the mental nerve supplying lower lip and chin and may cause numbness of those areas. alternatively, the numbness may have started after taking local anesthesia in the lower front area for some tooth problem and the injection might have been given deep. in any case, it seems that the nerve supplying sensation to the lower front area of jaw along with lower lip and chin (mental nerve) is damaged. usually, if the nerve is damaged, it can regenerate in 3-6 months and the sensations can return. if you are not sure regarding the crown on the tooth, you can avoid it for some months and take care not to bite hard things with that tooth so that it does not fracture. you can get the crown after the numbness is solved. i would also advise you to visit an oral and maxillofacial surgeon for the examination of the area and regarding numbness. he/she might take an x-ray to rule out presence of periapical lesion or cyst in relation with the tooth. crown should surely be postponed until this possibility is ruled out. i hope this information helps you. thank you for choosing chat doctor. i wish you feel better soon. best,"

by daughter was diagnosed with transient tachypnea 6 days ago after birth . another a ray today revealed no improvement with reduction of fluid on lungs and a drop in saturated oxygen was observed . doctors have put her back on oxygen and told me another week to clear . this seems a very long time for ttn to be a problem ..... ? that else could be issue ?,1,31373,"hello. welcome to chat doctor, and thank you for your question. i carefully read your query. supplemental oxygen always helps in congestive heart failure patients. some of these patients need it with higher percentages of ejection fraction and some with lower. a congestive heart failure patient with a 20% function of the left ventricle is advised to be confined only to every-day duties and not various strains of a healthy heart or a slightly decreased heart function. a 20% functioning heart means that 80% of its content remains in the left ventricle (normal being 30-45%) in every cardiac cycle. this means that blood coming from the pulmonary circulation does not have space to empty, and all of this is interpreted as a raised pressure in this circulation. this produces fluid build up in lungs and difficulty to breath (dyspnea). therefore, the lower the heart function percentage, the higher and the more often the need for supplemental oxygen. besides oxygen, a good support to lowering the above-mentioned pulmonary circulation high pressure, are the diuretics, and in these figures, i would recommend a loop diuretic and a potassium-sparing diuretic to her therapy. no salt should be used in her diet, whatsoever, because it retains the water and further raises the pulmonary pressure. i hope i was helpful with my answer. take care. best regards,"

"by boyfriend and a had sex tonight . it was the first time for both of us and while it was happening , the condom kept slipping off and getting stuck half way in my vagina . it scared me at first and he assured me that it was going to be okay . to it slipped off quite a few times and we re-adjusted it every time it came off . be did not ejaculate in me because he wanted to make sure none of it would get in me . but a a afraid some of the pre-cum may have gotten inside me . and a a expecting my period within the next few days . is there a chance a could be pregnant ? also , could a get pregnant from us rubbing our genitals on each others ?",1,37527,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. even though your boyfriends penis was inside you for only a short time, sperm can be present in pre-ejaculate (or pre-cum) and if you truly do not want to become pregnant it is really important to avoid any contact of the penis with your vagina during sexual play. the most fertile time of a woman cycle is in the middle, typically 14 days before your menstrual period would be due. so the time from when your period finishes until you start to feel pms symptoms is your fertile time. so in this case, since your boyfriend did not ejaculate, it still would be quite rare for you to have conceived. the most common sign of pregnancy is a late or delayed menstrual period. so in your case, you just need to wait for your period to arrive, and if it is late, you can do an over-the-counter urine pregnancy test which is greater than 99% accurate. pregnancy test do not become positive however until at least 2 to 3 weeks after conception. so in summary, your chances of having gotten pregnant in your particular situation is very, very low. for the future, please make sure that the penis is completely covered with a condom if it has any contact with the opening of your vagina. as long as the area is moist, sperm can swim all the way up your vagina from the opening and result in pregnancy. however, the amount of sperm in pre-cum is extremely low, so again i doubt that you need to be concerned about this one sexual encounter. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was helpful. best wishes,"

"i , my friend had been complaining of abdominal and chest pains including sharp pains occasionally . the doctor recommended an endoscopy where she was told there was swelling in her stomach and a biopsy was done . is it normal to have swelling due to an ulcer or is it likely that its cancerous in nature ?",1,56216,"hi thanks for choosing chat doctor for your medical query. i'm sorry but your question is deficient in a lot of information that would have been very helpful for me to answer. you have not mentioned if this was the first episode of pain, or she has past history. you did not mention if she hd any accompanying symptoms like diarrhea, vomiting, blood in stool or vomits, fever, pallor or jaundice. was her abdomen tender to touch? has the pain gotten worse, or it has subsided in intensity? is it only present in the upper abdomen or has it shifted to some other area or extended further? you also did not specify which tests and scans were ordered and came out negative. i can infer that the pain was very severe from the fact that she was hospitalized. upper abdominal pain can be due to a number of causes she might have pancreatitis, cholecystitis or peptic ulcer. pancreatic enzyme levels, ultrasound scan and h pylori antigen should be performed to rule out these conditions. as you have mentioned she had work up done at a hospital so i assume she was evaluated for these conditions. if all other tests are normal she may have functional abdominal pain. it is common amongst girls between the ages of 5 years to 14 years. it is because of an altered mechanism for pain perception so that the affected individual is more sensitive to pain. no definitive cause for this pain can be found but that does not mean it's not real. it usually presents in anxious child chat doctor. it is usually accompanied by other symptoms like recurrent diarrhea, constipation and headaches. the usual sites are around the umbilicus and in the upper abdomen. if your child has been worked up fully for all serious condition the best course of action is to reassure her. try to eliminate stress as much as possible, incorporate soluble fibers in her diet. probiotics are also helpful. do not limit her activities due to pain and try not to let her miss school. talk to her teachers and explain to them the situation. do not dismiss her pain as nothing, acknowledge its presence but try to make your child see that she has to continue her activities in a normal fashion. hope my answer helps you if you have any father questions i would be happy to answer."

"i all and one , a just had a tooth extraction done monday just gone . as glad to find that a done have a dry socket but several things are worrying me : firstly it looks like 2 roots have been left in there , can this be right ? will it have complications later on ? is the tooth was suppose to be taken out due to pus being developed on the gum and was infecting everything around it , .. ? secondly , the tooth next to it its gum split ... one side is flopping around ? will it grow back together ? shall a be rebooting to go and see the dentist ? thank you in advance",1,53390,hi. can understand your concern. as per your complaint the swollen gum and the white material inside it is a result of some inflammation. there can be a few reasons depending upon whether it is the second molar or the wisdom tooth. in case it is a wisdom tooth which is erupting or is impacted then the gum above it can get infected and inflamed due to either food deposition between the gum and the wisdom tooth or it can be due to gum flap bitten by the opposite jaw tooth and the condition is known as peritonitis. the white material in it is pus. in case it is second molar the swollen gum with white material in it can be as a result of infection in the gums due to deposits on the teeth like plaque or calculus or due to foreign body impaction in the gums which carries infection along with it deeper into the gums causing pus formation. it can also be due to deeply infected tooth causing pus formation below the tips of the roots of the tooth causing swelling on the gums with pus inside. i would suggest you to consult a dentist and get evaluated for the exact cause of the swelling and get treated accordingly. in case if it is wisdom tooth either excision of gum flap or extraction if the tooth is impacted followed by antibiotics and painkillers can be done. in case of gum infection professional cleaning of teeth followed by antibiotics and gum paints can help. in case of tooth infection root canal treatment or extraction depending on the condition of the tooth can be done. hope your query is solved. if you find the answer helpful please write a positive review and click on find this answer helpful as a token of appreciation. thanks and regards. chat doctor.

"i , just noticed stool in my 6 month old a stool , he is not constipated and stools were normal color for a formula fed baby , did have small red spots as well . he is happy smiling moving and playing and not lethargic at this time . has eaten bananas and oatmeal and formula in the past 24 hours",1,62311,"hi, welcome to chat doctor. your child is 6 month old and is passing stools 5 to 6 times per day, and the stool is watery. a 6-month child can pass stools 5 to 6 times per day or may pass stool once in a day, both these things are normal. but the stools should not be watery and should not bother the child. since, your child has watery stools on taking formula milk, it seems that your child has probably some allergy to that formula milk. in my opinion, you should change the formula milk to some other brand, it will solve your problem. if after changing formula milk, the problem persists then we have to think of cow milk allergy and start the child on lactose free milk. i hope this will help you. take care."

i my name is arleen ... a married 3 months back and was trying to conceive ... also i he cod but after marriage my periods were regular without any medicine on the same date every month for 3days a after that light/spotting till 6 days ... cod test were normal a my doctor said no need to do anything just keep taking metformin gyciphage .... this month my date was on 6 a i got my periods on 8th for 2 days only ... after that until now its clean . just stems when i go in washroom i see some traces rest it only lasted for 2 days a was heavier ... is everything normal ? ?,1,108096,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. it is true that theoretically you should have been clear of the injection within three months of discontinuation, however many women after being a depo-provera for a long time do not resume having ovulatory, regular, menstrual cycles until 6 to 9 months or even up to a year after discontinuation. unfortunately, it is difficult to artificially induce ovulation in women who are coming off depo-provera. if you were not trying to become pregnant, your cycle could be regulated temporarily with birth control pills, but if you're actually trying to get pregnant the best thing you can do with this point is to just keep trying and wait and see. if you feel any symptoms of pregnancy, and you haven't gotten your period for a while, i would do pregnancy test just to make sure. there is always a possibility even if your periods are not regular that you do ovulate sometimes. so in summary, continue having unprotected sex every other to every three days and give it some more time. 80% of couples will conceive within one year, and if after a year of trying you and your partner are unsuccessful, it might be a good idea to see a fertility specialist for an evaluation. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes, and good luck getting pregnant,"

"a used chloride to get pregnant the first time , had my baby in december 2011. i stopped breastfeeding in august 2012 had one menstrual cycle in september 2012 and then no cycle since and negative pregnancy test . is there anything natural a can take to help restart my cycles ?",1,100663,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. contrary to popular belief, many women can miss a menstrual cycle once in a while for reasons other than pregnancy. stress, weight changes, differences in your daily schedule, and even worrying about pregnancy can delay your cycle and sometimes even make you skip your period. what i can say for sure, which i hope you find reassuring, is that there is no way that you could be pregnant from an encounter that happened before you had to normal menstrual cycles. however, if you had had sex since your last period, i would recommend performing a pregnancy test as the most common sign of pregnancy is a missed menstrual cycle. what i suggest you do at this time is, if there is no possibility of pregnancy, just try to wait and see what happens when your period would be due this month. if you miss another menstrual cycle, it would be prudent to see a doctor for evaluation, as other hormonal problems and medical issues can also be a reason why your menstrual cycle skipped. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was reassuring. best wishes,"

i a finished my period the first of november and a be been having these pains and spotting and today a have this light brown is discharge and a horrible cramping pain my period lasted four days a be been trying to get pregnant when a the best time and are these pains normal,1,76471,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the most common sign of pregnancy is a missed menstrual period. if you have been having unprotected sex, you are risk for pregnancy. pregnancy symptoms vary widely between women, and symptoms of breast tenderness, vaginal discharge, mood changes, spotting, bloating and the like can be present both in pregnancy and in a premenstrual state. the best way to figure out if you are pregnant or not is to perform an over-the-counter urine pregnancy test. these tests are accurate to the same degree as a urine test performed in the doctor's office, and/or positive within three weeks of conception. so in summary, if you have been having unprotected intercourse, i recommend that you perform a urine test to rule out pregnancy. if you are not pregnant, and have missed your menstrual cycle for three months, it would be prudent to see a local gun physician because hormonal imbalances and other causes may be the reason you have not menstruated for such a long time and the symptom should be evaluated. i hope that i've adequately answered your question today, and that this advice was helpful. best wishes,"

i have a sliding hernia and c.o.p.d also high blood pressure and high cholesterol in addition to angina and 13 years ago i had a mastectomy . next wednesday i will have a are assessment before having my gall bladder removed by keyhole surgery . my main concern is will i be of having this of with copy and my hernia problem . as anyone undergone this surgery before with these problems . thank you .,1,36670,"hi. thanks for the query. you didn't mention the indication for removal of your gall bladder. even though you are having gall stones, if you are not having pain in the right upper part of the abdomen, there is no need for surgery. it can be incidental gall stone. as you are going for keyhole surgery(laparoscopy), you will be given general anesthesia. your anesthetist should be very competent to give anesthesia to a copd patient. sliding hernia is not a contra indication for keyhole surgery. high blood pressure will be controlled by antihypertensives. cholesterol levels will also be controlled. everything will be assessed in your pre assessment. if you are fit for surgery, you can ask your surgeon to do sliding hernia also in the same set-up through keyhole method. as there is no medical treatment for sliding hernia, you can ask your surgeon to do both procedures in single setting. i have done gall bladder removal surgery with copd without any complication in open method, not by keyhole procedure. hope you will be fit for keyhole surgerywish you good health. regards"

hello doctor ... i am 19 y.o .... 3 days back i went to the gym and did some pushups .. while doing pushups i felt some kind of severe cramp in my abdomen on the left side as if some nerves or muscles are contracting .. i did to took this seriously but from next day there is continuously some white liquid coming out and the urine also comes without any prior feeling .. in the beginning it was accompanied by some pain in right testes but now its some what of .. due to leakage of this fluid i am also not feeling any arousal ... if you can provide some suggestions please .. in desperate need of them .. is it going to get cured automatically in a month or so or i should try some treatment ... please reply sir ..,1,73735,"hi, thanks for a brief history of you.first you have pain in the left or right side. well let's take it in general as the upper abdomen. below the rib cage. few questions to figure out? what is the nature of the pain? are you having any gastric issue? are you facing any trouble with passing urine? have you undergone the diagnostic ultrasound scan for the abdomen region? if not please go for one as it will reveal any issues faced by the systems beneath the abdominal muscles. now since you take medicine and feel relief it shoes the medicines are symptomatically giving you a little relief. if you have gastric issues, then your metabolism is slow for which you need to boost up your metabolism. now question comes how? the answer is to perform some simple core strengthening exercises. now if you are facing with any urine related issues like low flow or if you consume less fluid in your daily routine? if that is the case kindly chat doctor. now let's come to the pain, since you said it is below the ribs then i will advise you to do some regular deep breathing exercises while placing the hand over the painful area which will also help strengthen the muscles. what your physician prescribed you was for symptomatic relief from pain. but you need to focus on improving your overall metabolism which can be possible by doing regular exercises.to come to a closer diagnosis you need to undergo a diagnostic ultrasound scan. which will help rule out something over there. based on that the next step of medical action can be done. so kindly visit an internal medicine specialist and get this done.in the meantime try doing some core strengthening exercises and some deep breathing exercises. your muscles will become stronger, and you will find ease of your pain. physician of your must-have surely tried to figure out the issue. kindly provide the full cooperation and undergo a scan of abdomen. taking too much medicine without medical guidance is not advisable. as self-medication on long term always have side effects, and it will lead to gastric issues which will also aggravate the pain in the same region. with the grace of god i wish you a speedy recovery."

"hello , just a query , i just had a very fast heart beat and made me dizzy , the best way i can describe it is my heart felt like it had a little pop and then came a really fast rush of a heart beat and made me feel dizzy , it only lasted 5 seconds or maybe less i was sitting down at the time , is this something i should be concerns about or not . thanks rob",1,88858,"hello and thank you for using chat doctor. i carefully read your question and i understand your concern. i will try to explain you something and give you some advises. as you describe my opinion is that we are dealing with a rhythm issue. someone might feel heart palpitations for different reasons. it may be a simple sinus tachycardia that means that the heart is beating regularly over 100 beats for minute. its normal resting rate is between 60-100 beat for minute. you may experience palpitations because of extra-sistolyc beats. these is electrical impulses generating from parts of the heart different from normal sinus rhythm. this gives the sensation of an escaped, skipping beat. but there are all sow different rhythm problems like atrial fibrillation ore supra ventricular tachycardia where the heart doesn't beat normal, it suddenly beats fast or in a chaotic way with very high frequencies and this might be what we call atrial fibrillation. my opinion is that lifting weight is not the reason of your palpitations. it's quite known in cardiology that during physical exertion the heart rate raises. its maximal frequency should go 220 minus your age, and it should slowly go down. but you describe a long history of palpitations and a sudden heart jumping just for some seconds, immediately chat doctor. so, i think that we should see what are these rhythm fluctuations. does this happen even in a resting situation or only when you exercise? if i was your treating doctor i will recommend a blood analyze, your thyroid hormones, an electrocardiography, echocardiogram and of course a holder monitoring to see your rhythm tendency. ones we have all these we can say what are these palpitations and how to treat them.these is all for a simple check-up to reduce these episodes in the future. whish i was helpful. take good care. best regards"

my mother aged 66yrs has cancer of the food pipe can this be cured . she has been a heavy smoker and beer drinker for forty yrs+ . the cancer can not be operated on because to close to the mortar . or have suggested high doses of radiation and chem . will this help or just give her more time ? is the cure as bad as the cancer in terms of side effects ?,1,2219,"hi, thanks for writing in. cancer is a difficult condition to treat and if your aunt has stage 4 cancer then survival even with the best care can vary from 6 months to two years. it is important to know the exact area of cancer involvement. cancer in esophagus happens due to the growth extending in to the lumen and then proliferating to cause obstruction to ingested foods. surgery cannot be done at this stage and therefore radiation therapy has been recommended by her doctors. to increase passage of flow through the cancer area, you can discuss with your doctors if she can be given monitored doses of radiation followed by inserting a metallic stent to cause improvement in swallowing. radiation is best and chemotherapy may be even more difficult for her in this case. please do not worry."

"a had lumps on both sides near the vagina , a bit pain when i touch them . there a no pain when a urinate , the smell is normal . but little by little there a pain behind . a am 44 yrs old with only 1 sexual partner .... what is it ? where it came from ? is there any infection inside ? what should a do ? ..",1,43763,hellothanks for query. you have misconception about premature ejaculation. premature ejaculation is an ejaculation that happens when one ejaculates within one minute after penetration of vagina while is engaged in intro vaginal sexual intercourse with female partner and is not applicable to while masturbating. what you get is an early ejaculation due to excessive penile stimulation by shaking your penis during masturbation. the size of the penis in flaccid state has no significance at all. it is hardness of the penis on erection that is important for sexual satisfaction of both the partners. as such there is no medicine that can increase penile length and size. the night emission is natural and normal at the age of adolescence and gets resolved without any treatment over a period of time. chat doctor.

a am on the logon birth control pill . is it of for me to skip the seven pill free days and start on a new pack the day after finishing my current one ? how will this affect the effectiveness of the pill ?,2,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"i , pm a 25 year old female with no serious medical history . in the past 2 years a have had serious right flank pain that feels like someone is sticking a knife into my lower right back and it comes out my front . its a radiating pain , that comes and goes with no noticeable pattern . ave been tested for kidney tones , had ultra sounds of my abdomen and bloodworm done . a done know if its something internal or muscular . help !",1,105967,hi. thanks for your query and an elucidated history. you have already visited a doctor and the blood tests are normal. the probable cause of such a problem of pain that comes and goes in lower abdomen and lower right back a be due to :appendicitis. right ureteric stone with colic. typhlitisgyne problem related to the ovaries or fallopian tubes (if you are a female-not mentioned above). the best diagnostic tools are :ultrasonography and ct scan of the whole abdomen. relevant urine and stool tests and remaining blood tests of kidney function tests. this will give us a proper diagnosis and the plan for further treatment.

my son is 11 and we looked at his scalp tonight and the entire bottom part of it from the bottom of hairline to above his ears all the way across is covered in what looks like perfectly round relish oranges spots all in it like 100 or morelos like i done like at it often but did because of the ticks getting bad so done know how long they've been there or anything in really scared and worried can a help me please . be says they done itch and he didst know they were there,1,50236,"early institution of antibiotics for small illnesses can really affect the babies immunity adversely, as the children immune system never gets the chance to fight the infection or the insult to the body that keeps coming in from all directions! it seems that this might be the cause why he keeps needing care from a doctor and repeated prescriptions of antibiotics. the repeated infections have, in turn, affected his all-round growth. what i would like you to do is to a) understand that fever is what helps the children body to fight his infection, as long as it is not so high that it triggers off a fit (as it did in your sons case). b) avoid starting antibiotics at the very start of a cold or fever or cough; give him plenty of warm soup and other bland and non-cold liquids; c) sponge him from neck to knees with lukewarm water and give him paracetamol to reduce his fever and d) see a doctor - a pediatrician - only if the fever lingers on for more than 2 days, or if it is very high (more than 39 degree c). in this way, you can gradually bring your son out of this endless circle of disease - antibiotic - relief - disease."

"i or . a had noticed a sudden numbness at top left side of foot all the way to the ankle , not the whole left foot is numb just a small area up to the ankle .its been about 12 hours and has not gone away but has not spread either.do you have any idea ? thanks for your input and or any suggestions .",1,86595,"hi there. it does appear from your history that you have sustained a severe injury to the left ankle and foot region. now the first thing that you have to understand is that the problem of recurrent swelling will be a persistent one and will only resolve so much. the overall blood supply over the foot and ankle is relatively poor, and furthermore the multiple scars which are present around the foot would make the venous and lymphatic chat doctor. this would lead to fluid retention which should have ideally been pumped back, so the result would appear as generalized swelling of the foot. the tingling sensation at the sole of the foot is probably due to a nerve injury that you would have sustained there. if i had a patient who'd present to me with such symptoms, i would prescribe a course of pregabalin 75 mg and b complex tablets for the nerve injury and advise using compression stockings for the foot. do active and passive ankle range of movement exercises to reduce some of the stiffness that you might be experiencing now. ask your physiotherapist to help you out for the same."

"my two year old grandbaby has been throwing up since tuesday which was her second birthday , she was feeling fine on yesterday but woke up this morning with vomiting all over again . she really does not have an appetite she does not want to drink any more peristyle can i give her something to eat",2,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."
