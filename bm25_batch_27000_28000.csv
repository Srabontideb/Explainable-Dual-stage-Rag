hello in 7 days delayed . be and my boyfriend went to hospital to have pregnancy blood test and it is positive . but we done want this pregnancy what medicine can i take . does taking primolut nor help me lose it . thank you . really i need your help . because in in middle east now that why i cant get pregnant,1,39989,"hello yellowtulip24,welcome to chat doctor. there are many issues involved in your post. let me try and solve them one by one. if your period was expected on the 4th, it's too early to check with pregnancy tests on 5th. one should wait at least 3 days after missed period to do urine pregnancy test. you posted your questions today. did you do a pregnancy test after the 5th and when? if not, please check first morning sample of urine for pregnancy tomorrow morning. even if you have irregular periods, don't get complacent and presume that this cycle too it must be irregular. it could be a pregnancy since metformin not only helps in reducing weight but regularizes the cycle by causing an egg release. the low abdomen pain - if your pregnancy test is positive tomorrow morning, please get a transvaginal ultrasound asap to rule out a pregnancy in the tube. get in touch with your local doctor for this. sanitizing is an anti-acid preparation which research has shown to be safe even in pregnant women. folic acid is important to prevent abnormalities in the baby and it's always best to start when planning pregnancy i.e. even before pregnancy is conceived. i do not know what doses of primolut-n you have been prescribed. you may have been prescribed this for 5-10 days to get a with chat doctor. please rule out pregnancy by the latest urine test before taking this. if a patient is pregnant we like to use other forms of hormones to support pregnancy. generally primolut-n is not used for this purpose. in short, if you are definitely not pregnant, its safe and ok to use primolute-n. the other 2 medicines mentioned are safe anyway. hope this answers your queries satisfactorily."

"hi , i woke this morning with sudden abdominal pain and joint pain . this is the last day of my period and a a 49. before my period last week a had similar joint pain but no nausea . a be been in able to keep water down an have thrown up three times today with diarrhoea . initially i thought the joint pain was from dehydration so i kept drinking but a just threw up . now i have pain on my left side under the rib ( spleen ? ) and exhaustion . do you think this is food poisoning or could it be related to releasing a cyst or something ? thanks for your information",1,10535,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. pregnacare conception is simply a combination of vitamins that help a woman have a healthy pregnancy from conception. it has no hormonal effects and should not have any impact on the regularity of your cycle nor your ability to conceive, it is not unusual for women to bleed on and off for even 6 weeks after a miscarriage so the 19-day bleeding episode you had may not have actually been a menstrual period but still could have been bleeding leftover for your d and c. so you may not be ""late"" at all, but may just have not had a real period since the pregnancy. there is no reason to assume you would have problems getting pregnant again since you have conceived naturally twice in the last year. either way, the pregnancies conception vitamins have nothing to do with your irregular bleeding. it is generally advisable to wait to try to conceive again after your first real period-so i would wait until you bleed again to resume trying to conceive. if you do not get a real period by 3 months from your last bleeding episode, you should follow up for your gun for a re-evaluation of your hormones and treatment with progesterone, which can restart your period cycling. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful. best wishes,"

my boyfriend is a black male . he has been having chest pains and numbness in his arms . his blood pressure is 136 over 78. he is under a lot of stress but is otherwise very healthy . his doctors doesn't seem to be too concerned but a think he should get more tests done .,1,110269,"hello! thank you for asking on chat doctor! i understand your concern and would explain that these changes in the blood pressure may be related to physical activity, psychological stress, high salt intake with food, caffeine intake, etc. his blood pressure values are above the normal limits (130/90 mm hg), most of the time, which means that he is suffering from high blood pressure. lifestyle modifications are very important at this stage of high blood pressure. is he already making these changes to his lifestyle? this doesn't seem to be an emergency. my opinion is that you may wait until october to see your doctor for a careful physical exam, a resting ecg, a chest x-ray and some blood lab tests (complete blood count, thyroid hormone levels, kidney and liver function tests, fasting glucose, blood electrolytes, etc.), to exclude other possible secondary causes of high blood pressure. you should discuss with his doctor the possibility of starting an antihypertensive therapy, if his blood pressure values are still at these levels, even with the lifestyle modifications. hope to have been helpful! best regards,"

"i doc , i a 22yrs old and married 4yrs ago i never conceived in between now i want to plan a family but i a suffering through pods and because of that i have diabetes , thyroid and insulin resistance menstrual cycle is also comes late every month and my hubby test a all normal last month my diabetes was 140 after lunch pc help me what to do ?",1,98003,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the greatest likelihood in your situation is that you have gestational diabetes. the majority of the time during routine prenatal care for diabetes somewhere between 24 and 28 weeks. ketones, a byproduct of sugar metabolism being present in your urine along with sugar backs up the diagnosis. if you're test for gestational diabetes was performed more than a month ago, or if you never had one, i suggest you share these results with your healthcare provider as they may want to repeat the test. gestational diabetes can be controlled sometimes with diet, however many women require oral hypoglycemics or insulin to control their blood sugar. this risk is increased in women who are obese or who have a family history of diabetes. so needing additional help in reducing your blood sugar during pregnancy is common and is not the fault of an inability to properly follow a proper diet. so i suggest for the benefit of the health of your pregnancy that you make an appointment with your prenatal care provider and that you discuss your results with them, they may want to do more intensive screening for diabetes and depending upon the level of your blood sugar may prescribe medications. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

(the amount of platelets in the bloodstream is reduced because the spleen is busy trapping them). so usually people with cirrhosis end up having a problem with portal hypertension and an enlarged spleen, and a reduced platelet count in the bloodstream. as time goes by, the liver may try to repair itself by growing new cells. if there is a lot of scar tissue already present the new cells grow between scar tissue (and result in abnormal nodules). the nodules and scar tissue further interfere with blood flow through the liver. so over time people with advanced cirrhosis can end up having a problem with more and more abnormal nodules and scar tissue forming which interferes even more with blood flow through the liver which makes the spleen continue to enlarge, and the platelet count continue to chat doctor. the splenomegaly is usually not reversible. please go for regular medical follow up. hope this helps"

"i by name is penny , a had bloods ca125 , swabs , and urine sample results today , one came back bone and also liver problem . a can to see my doctor unto ; next tuesday . a have borderline cancer and had surgery to remove my ovaries in may this year . an you give me an idea what this could mean . kind regards",1,52955,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. in the first trimester of pregnancy, your ovaries produce the hormone progesterone which normally is made by the placenta once it reaches adequate size. so it is not unusual in the first trimester pregnancy to feel pain in your ovaries. in addition, as your uterus stretches, you also may experience some cramping and pulling sensations, which can be on the sides. the only thing that is concerning is if you have not had an ultrasound this pregnancy to confirm that it is normal and located in your uterus. if you already have had an ultrasound for this pregnancy it is unlikely that there could be anything harmful going on, especially if you are not bleeding. so if the pain is severe enough that you cannot function, especially if you have not yet had an ultrasound, if you cannot reach her doctor within a reasonable amount of time, you may want to pursue care in an emergency setting. if you have had a normal ultrasound earlier in this pregnancy, you really do not need to worry, as your ovaries are normally examined as part of your pregnancy ultrasound and a large cyst would've already been detected. tylenol, or acetaminophen is safe to use for pain at the normal adult dosage during all trimesters of pregnancy, and you can try to see if that helps with the pain. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

"hello or , i have an itching problem from the past one year i consult 3 doctors , skin specialist they are telling its because of food only but i cant able to find which food it causing and in a south indian girl i didst take any allergy test can a plus tell me was the problem .",1,6870,"hello, thank you for posting your query on chat doctor. i appreciate your concern for your mother. food allergy is an immune system reaction that occurs soon after eating a certain food. even a tiny amount of the allergy-causing food can trigger signs and symptoms. the most common food allergy signs and symptoms include:tingling or itching in the motives, itching or eczemaswelling of the lips, face, tongue and throat or other parts of the bodywheezing, nasal congestion or trouble breathingabdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea or vomitingdizziness, lightheadedness or fainting in some people, a food allergy can trigger a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. this can cause life-threatening signs and symptoms, including:constriction and tightening of airways swollen throat or the sensation of a lump in your throat that makes it difficult to breatheshock with a severe chat doctor. this is a medical emergency, and she should go to the nearest hospital if she gets a symptom suggestive of anaphylaxis. food allergy should not be confused with food intolerance which is much more common and is a less serious condition that does not involve the immune system. in food intolerance one may be able to eat small amounts of problem foods without a reaction. by contrast, in a true food allergy, even a tiny amount of food may trigger an allergic reaction. because a food intolerance may involve some of the same signs and symptoms as a food allergy does like nausea, vomiting, cramping and diarrhea, people may confuse the two. there are skin tests and blood tests to detect the foods your mother may be allergic to. a specialist in internal medicine or an allergy specialist will be able to arrange that. if you have further queried, i am available. best wishes for your mothers good health."

"i , i have a 6 month old child and had no period yet . have all symptoms of being pregnant , even pregnant shaped tummy and no weight anywhere else . done several prev tests over 8 weeks all negative . a am taking 60mg fluoxitine for and , could this affect the result of home prev tests ? what can i do ?",1,49266,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. if you last had your period on september 12th, and today is october 5th, your period is not yet late for october. most women have a 25-35 day cycle, so until you actually miss your period for october, there is no reason to assume you are pregnant. the folic acid and zinc you are taking are just extra vitamins that provide health to a growing pregnancy; these should not affect or change your menstrual cycle or its symptoms. if your period is late in october, you should purchase and perform an over-the-counter pregnancy test. modern pregnancy tests are very accurate and can be positive even 10 days after conception. if you do find out you are pregnant, there is nothing that needs to be done immediately as pregnancy is not a disease- it is a normal state for women in the reproductive phase of their lives. so it is important only to keep taking your vitamins, get plenty of rest, eat a balanced diet and avoid alcohol, caffeine and chat doctor. if your period is mate, but you are not pregnant, the delay in your cycle can have a number of causes, including hormonal imbalances, certain medical conditions like thyroid disease, and even the stress of worrying about pregnancy. if you miss more than 2 months of your cycle (no bleeding for 3 months) and your pregnancy test is negative, you should see a physician for a hormonal evaluation. so in summary, a late menstrual cycle can be caused by pregnancy, but there are other causes as well. i suggest you perform a pregnancy test if you are late, and if it is negative, try to be patient, and you will likely get it before another month goes by. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"dear doctor good morning , yesterday i has gone for a scanning and i came to know that i have got anteverted bulky uterus ... and cyst in both sides .. do i face problems for getting conceived ? wat is the remedy doctor ? am aged 34 , height 5feet , weight around 63 kos , i have severe pain during periods ... i have proper periods ....",1,107969,"hi. thanks for asking in chat doctor. the return of menstruation after a progesterone injection like demo proverb is usually delayed. the cycles take many months to normalize and sometimes there may be complete suppression of periods. the increase of weight in the abdominal area is due to bulky uterus. normally during period, the endometrial cells of uterus proliferate (multiply) resulting in thickening of endometrium (inner lining of uterus) due to the action of estrogen. when menstruation starts this endometrium is shed out as clots and the uterus reverts to the normal size. since you have not got the periods, the thickened endometrium has resulted in bulky uterus. also, the hormonal imbalance due to absent period has added to your problem of weight gain. an ultrasound of uterus will reveal the size of uterus and the endometrial thickening. since endometrial proliferation can be either simple or can result in problems like cancer, you should visit a gynecologist for a proper evaluation and to rule out problems like cancer. i hope this is useful."

a have a glossophyrangeal neuralgia that has broken through the neurontin/gabapentin mask . a can not seem to get it back under the medicinal mask and the pain is excruciating . are there any new medications that will expedite a recovery from the pain . a was taking force but stopped and went through withdrawal so a prefer not to use another addictive drug . this is the first time a have tried this and did not realize that there is charge . a can not believe that a took the time to type all of this information and was duped into thinking that a was going to get a free on line answer regarding the medicine or any new procedures to relieve the pain . boo hoo a think we should be warned up front that there is a charge for the service .,1,58987,"his am chat doctor. i have read your message. i think i can help you. first, a package test means that multiple tests are included that correlate to the test. cpk and spe can both be package tests as there are many related tests needed in a diagnosis. the symptoms that you seem to be facing as per the query is basically severe backache that increases on lying down or bending-in other words, anything that causes the spine to be under pressure. now she itself can cause the symptoms. the muscles and bone problems can arise in she itself and thus possibly one will feel that there is nothing more to do. however, in many situations, the doctors may get biased my a diagnosis. so, i think it is good that your doctor did not get biased with your pre-existing diagnosis of she and continued to look for other causes of backache. a severe backache can happen due to muscle disorders, a condition known as myopathy. the cause of myopathy may be she itself. the test commonly done to test myopathy is cpk or creatine phospholipase. this is a test done from blood. the idea is if the cpk is raised, it suggests myopathy. in this situation, your doctor will need to modify the therapy. i am unaware of your medication from the query. so i cannot really comment upon it. but some medicines themselves cause myopathy. and sometimes, the dose of existing medicines need to be stepped up for treatment of myopathy. so i presume your doctor wanted to check that. second test was spe or serum protein electrophoresis. this is one of the tests for multiple myeloma. this is a type of malignancy that affects the bones and causes bone pains and should be ruled out in middle-aged to elderly commonly if the backache is worsening and is specially bad when lying down. if the test is negative, there is nothing to worry about. if it does come out to be positive, multiple myeloma can be treated. so again you need not worry since the treatment is available. why the doctor did not tell you about the tests is something i can only speculate about. i guess it was because these are just doubts, considering you already have she- in medicine, the usual dictum is that one disease can explain the symptom, the other condition should not be sought. having said that, it's a folly to miss another diagnosis due to a pre-existing condition. i think he would have told you if the tests came out positive. so there should be nothing to worry about-the doctor was just making sure that there is no other problem. possibly since there was nothing else diagnosed, he did not tell you about it. i have tried to make it as simple as possible to understand the situation. in case there are still doubts, feel free to contact me for further details. best of luck,"

i have recently been diagnosed with hepatitis c. a have noticed lately my cheeks get red and i kind of get a warm feeling on my face . a am 23 yrs old and most likely contracted the virus in the last year . are these symptoms possibly related to the virus and should i be overly worried ?,1,64468,"hello, i understand your concern. most cases of mononucleosis, mono, are caused by infection with the epstein-barr virus (abv) and get it only once. sometimes mononucleosis symptoms may recur months or even years later. once you're infected with abv, you carry the virus for the rest of your life. the virus may reactivate off and on. the virus can then be detected in the saliva, but one does not usually become ill. in mono one often has a general feeling of malaise, starting with non-specific symptoms such as fatigue, headache and sore throat. your main symptoms are lack of appetite and lack of energy and these are not likely to be the cause of mono. i think you should see an internist and have your condition investigated and diagnosed."

pm 19yrs old and a had sex.we put the condom on late .. so just incas a took the morning after pill within 24hrs . its been about a week and live been urinating like crazy ! i can barley hold my bladder before dying to use the restroom . is there a reasonable explanation ?,1,1599,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the morning after pill is 90 percent effective if taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse. so, regardless of what happened with your pill taking before your pill-free week, the morning-after pill should still be effective. many women have a delayed period after taking the morning-after pill as a side effect, but the possibility of pregnancy still exists if you are late, so you should perform a urine pregnancy test just in case. if it has not been 2 weeks yet since your unprotected encounter, it may be too early to have a positive pregnancy test, so i would repeat it in a week if that is the case. in addition, many women have an irregular period or skip entirely after they stop the pill. if you are not pregnant, you can start a new pack of pills as soon as you get them, but just use a condom as a backup for the first two weeks. you should get a period in the pill-free week as you did previously. i hope i was able to answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"hello . a was just told a have an abscess tooth that needs to be removed . it is in a tooth that had a root canal and a do not have any pain in my mouth or face . however , a have been having pain in my neck for the last few weeks . any possibility they are connected ? thanks so much .",1,78428,hi. thanks for the query. it looks like you have reinfection below the root tips of your root canal treated tooth and due to infection and pus formation there is swelling. the other cause can be decay in adjacent tooth that might have become non-vital causing periapical abscess. as the nerve inside the root canal treated tooth is already removed during root canal treatment therefore you do not have pain in the tooth. so my suggestion is to further get it confirmed by an x-ray of the tooth that is already treated and along with it the teeth next to it should also be covered under x-ray. if there is infection in root canal treated tooth then first a script of antibiotics like augmenting will be advised to see if the infection resolves. if it still does not resolve then extraction should be done as tooth is already root canal treated twice. if any adjacent tooth is decayed then rot canal treatment is advisable. hope this helps. regards.

"i , a trying to conceive since the past few months a did every efforts but failed . by cycles are regular a last were over on the 6th of an so whats the best time to conceive ? also me a my husband are under the scored tablets and me also taking nominal by consulting a doctor.question is : hats is the best time to conceive and what else i can do to be pregnant .",1,111986,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. in normal healthy couples, it can sometimes even take up to a year to conceive. 80% of couples will conceive within one year if having regular unprotected intercourse (at least 2 to 3 days per week). it is best not to time the efforts of intercourse around ovulation unless you have accurately documented the ovulation date, with an ovulation predictor kit or with hormone levels checked at the doctor's office. the best way to try to conceive in the beginning is to have sex every other day from the time your period finishes until you start to feel premenstrual symptoms. premenstrual symptoms are caused by the same hormones as produced by pregnancy, so when you start to feel bloating, breast tenderness, nausea, or other pregnancy symptoms you do not need to continue to try to conceive that cycle, as you either already ovulated or are already pregnant. there are nearly 6 million sperm in every ejaculate from a man, so as long as some sperm is ejaculated inside the vagina, there is a possibility of conceiving. many women have sperm leak out after intercourse, however the ability of sperm to swim within the vagina ensures that a man with a normal sperm count has at least thousands of sperm that reach the egg if ovulation has been taking place. so in summary, many couples do not conceive within two months of beginning to try. i encourage you and your husband to have patience. in the meantime, the best way to prepare for healthy pregnancy is to get adequate rest, eat a healthy diet, avoid alcohol consumption, and take a prenatal vitamin or folic acid supplement which can help prevent birth defects. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"by sister a 14 year old son has indentation of his rib cage . is is tall for his age , and very slender . a have known other children with this condition that had to get surgically corrected . that is the term for what he has , and what is the surgery ?",1,831,"hi, thanks for writing in. it appears that your son has a melanoma that might have spread to neck lymph nodes. this is a possibility and has to be confirmed by doing a biopsy. what happens is that lymph nodes are found in many regions of the body and are small unless they are stimulated by disease process. when there is a disease in a person then the lymph nodes of a particular region get enlarged and this is a reaction by the immune mechanism. since your son has been told that he has a melanoma, it has probably involved the neck lymph nodes. the lymph nodes in the neck are close to the carotid artery and internal jugular vein, and it is possible that the lymph nodes have wrapped around these. doing a surgery in this condition is not possible and radiation usually works. it is suggested that you spend some time with your son by going over to his place and know more about the treatment he should be taking for his condition. please do not worry."

a need some advise.i was recently told my 3yr old will need 4 caps on his four front teeth . one dentist said they would do with local anastasia and novocain but couldn't get a x-ray . the other dentist said he would need general anastasia in a hospital setting and wont take my insurance . the 1st place will and already gave me a quote . that is the best option as far as him being comfortable during the procedure ?,1,96114,"dear friend. thanks for sharing your concern.first i would like to explain to you that the nerves of the teeth are not interconnected to any other organ like eye brain etc.extraction would not affect these organs for sure. every small part in our body has its own muscle and nerve supply, which does specific function related to that organ. now coming to your dentist advise, i think there is some misunderstanding regarding teeth extraction. he or she would have said that, you require four teeth extraction as there is no space in the jaw to move the proclaimed teeth. secondly remember it is premolars(back teeth)which is usually extracted never the front teeth.here is the best suggestion that i can give you is please revisit our dentist and understand complete treatment procedure before taking any decision in haste. extraction is required, for how many teeth, can be decided only upon taking an x-ray called cephalogram, and iowa x-rays. hope i have answered your query. for further query please let me know. thanks. take care."

what is the possible medical condition of a three year old who has blacked out when she hit her head . this has happened twice . once when she fell out of a chair after having a little tantrum about food that was on her plate . the second time hitting her head on a counter . the came around shortly after .,1,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"in the past few days a had a very bad attack of pain in the ruq and after ultrasound was diagnosed with gallstones and suggested gallbladder removal . by question is , if a have another attack before surgery will meloxicam 15mg ( being an said ) help with the inflammation and pain . the last attack lasted 6 hours and needless to say was excruciating . thank you",1,77921,"most people who have gallstones do not have symptoms. if you have symptoms, you most likely will have mild pain in the pit of your stomach or in the upper right part of your belly. pain may spread to your right upper back or shoulder blade area. sometimes the pain is more severe. it may be steady, or it may come and go. or it may get worse when you eat. you may decide to go to the doctor because of pain in your belly. in this case, your doctor will ask you questions about when the pain started, where it is, and if it comes and goes or is always there. your doctor may order imaging tests. these take pictures of the inside of your body. an ultrasound of the belly is the best test to find gallstones. this test does not hurt. your ultrasound may not show gallstones. but if your doctor still thinks you have a problem with your gallbladder, he or she may order a gallbladder scan. in this test, a doctor injects dye into a vein in your arm. then a machine takes x-rays as the dye moves through your liver, bile duct, gallbladder, and intestine. if you do not have symptoms, you probably do not need treatment. if your first gallstone attack causes mild pain, your doctor may tell you to take pain medicine and wait to see if the pain goes away. you may never have another attack. waiting to see what happens usually will not cause problems. if you have a bad attack, or if you have a second attack, you may want to have your gallbladder removed. a second attack means you are more likely to have future attacks. many people have their gallbladders removed, and the surgery usually goes well. doctors most often use laparoscopic surgery. for this, your surgeon will make small cuts in your belly and remove your gallbladder. you will probably be able to go back to work or your normal routine in a week or two, but it may take longer for some people. sometimes the surgeon will have to make a larger cut to remove the gallbladder. it will take longer for you to recover from this type of surgery. regards and take care"

"yea i started feeling really weak and feverish yesterday around afternoon . i have become very cautious , feverish , a slight cough and then lower left abdomen started with discomfort like a sharp pain but was very fatigue and has become more frequent and very uncomfortable . took temp . and it was 98.1 and upset stomach area last night and feel like i could throw up ... a just had a period and have a ensure device which is a permanent birth control since 2006 .",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

i a am currently on my third cycle of closed and my doctor has called me to say that my last day21 blood test showed my progesterone was 118.4nmols so he thinks a should be pregnant . one a home test and it a negative though . would a still be pregnant or is there another reason why my progesterone is so high ? by previous day21 results were 58.7 thanks laura,1,52747,"hello, and i hope i can clarify this for you. you are absolutely correct in the fact that the length of your cycle is related to when you ovulate... and your ovulation date is 14 days back from when you got your period, rather than counting 14 days from the start of your period. it is typical for most women to have a 14-day luteal phase, as you suggested. you absolutely may ovulate later in your cycle. i do not know how long you and your partner have tried to conceive before trying closed. i would not recommend trying closed at all unless you have tried for a year (meaning unprotected sex at least 2-3 times per week) and not become pregnant. a reproductive endocrinologist is an appropriate referral if you have a history of infertility for one year, and if you fail at least 3 cycles of closed. they can prescribe closed and combine it with intrauterine insemination, which can increase the success rate. even though you may have had a child together before, there can be an issue with the male partner too, and it would be advisable he gets his sperm count evaluated. but you can still have conceived this cycle if you ovulated on the closed, and continued to have unprotected sex at least a week after your ovulation kit showed positive. your progesterone level pre-ovulation is not relevant at all. so- if you don't get a period by day 35 or so, do a pregnancy test. and if you didn't conceive this cycle, a reproductive endocrinologist might be a better choice to manage your closed. i hope this answered your question, and best of luck in getting pregnant. take care,"

"hi , a am a bit curious and worried my brother in law is bleeding from both breast . discharge is also coming out . be also has a lump on his back and saying its fat . the breast is bleeding lot so much he has to wear about three shirts at the same time",1,82366,"hello friend, thank you for posting your query through chat doctor. i am a homeopath answering your query and the answer which i am going to give you may contain several thoughts which may appear strange or new for you. this i say because homeopathy is a new system of medicine and is almost unheard by the majority of the population. therefore, due to the high influence of the conventional medicine the people at large are brainwashed to believe and act according to the health education given by them. coming back to the fibroadenoma of your left breast in the year 1979, you had a psychological conflict in the mind level. you are a sensitive individual and that is why your left breast was affected. it must have been related with your child chat doctor. the sensitivity is genetic, and you reacted to the conflict through the brain according to a genetic programming. mind-brain - organ affection resulted in the development of a lump in your left breast in 1979. you consulted your gynecologist, and he suggested that it may turn to become cancerous in future and so it is better to remove it, and you subdued to his suggestion. actually the lump in the breast was an attempt of the body to cure you, or it was the result of a self defense mechanism. since you had not resolved the conflict in the psychological level, the lump remained there without getting resolved. but the body kept the lump protected in a cyst with minimum amount of inflammation called chronic cystitis. by removing the fibroadenoma or chronic cystic mastitis, you were not cured, but your lump in the breast was removed. in 1995 also you are the same person, you are the same sensitive person, and you underwent another more serious psychological conflict and the same left breast was again affected in a more serious manner. instead of recognizing the mass as a defense mechanism, you got the fear in you that you have cancer. the tissue changes also suggested that there is more serious pathology, and they labelled your lump this time as cancer and suggested removal of your left breast. if you could have recognized the lump as a defense mechanism and if you had no fear of cancer, you could have retained your breast. but the fear of cancer is such that it is associated with death and so you lost your breast. in no case, either by removal of lump in 1979 or by removal of your breast in 1995, you are not cured only your disease is cured. hope by this time you have got the answer for your query. both are related to each other because they are in the same individual, same sensitivity, same program. homeopathy cures the person and once the individual is cured all his diseases will be cured. with best wishes,"

flo doctor ... my mother is suffering from diabetes from the past 19-20 yrs ... recently we got her sugar level tested and results were shocking ... with fasting it was 197 and without fasting it was 210 ... the is taking glyz-m .... pizza suggest something for her,1,70463,"hello have gone through your question and understood your concern. fasting blood sugar (fbs) measures blood glucose after you have not eaten for at least 8 hours. it is the first test done to check for prediabetes and diabetes. if you were not fasting, then the result can not be taken in consideration for the diagnosis of pre-diabetes or diabetes. in my opinion, this result can be considerate like a random blood sugar (rbs) and measures blood glucose regardless of when you last ate. random testing is useful because glucose levels in healthy people do not vary widely throughout the day and blood glucose levels that vary widely may mean a problem. this test is also called a casual blood glucose test. it is true that your age, positive family history and being african american are risc factors for diabetes. but the test result can not be taken in consideration for the diagnosis because it is not fasting. a fasting blood sugar level from 100 to 125 mg/dl is considered prediabetes. if its 126 mg/dl or higher or a random blood sugar level of 200 mg/dl or higher ; on two separate tests, you have diabetes.(actually, if you were fasting, 129 mg/dl can be suggestive of diabetes not prediabetes and the next step will be to repeat the test for the confirmation of the diagnosis)in my opinion you don't have reason to be concerned because the test result is not a fasting but a random measurement, and we can not reach the diagnosis only with this test. so, be patient because the true fasting test will give the exact information about your situation. hope this is helpful. if you have other debts, feel free and ask. best regards."

"by doctor found a nodular mass in my annual exam yesterday . it is in the jul de sac between the uterus and colon . although a have not had pain , when she pressed on it , it was very tender and uncomfortable . the indicated that a should have an ultrasound and blood work . a am 49 and have had mini-cycles twice this year ( 14 days and 15 days after a regular cycle ) . however , she did not schedule the blood work or ultrasound yesterday and her assistant did not call today , so a don to think this is urgent . by question is : what percent of masses in this area are cancer ?",1,40763,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the clearblue test is not very accurate in predicting gestational age. the amount of pregnancy hormone in a women urine can vary depending on the time of day she did the test and how much water she had to chat doctor. furthermore, many women have some bleeding in the first trimester of pregnancy, so the bleeding she had in december and january may not have been her real period at all. the most accurate way to test the age of a pregnancy, is an ultrasound exam to measure the fetus. this is normally done during the course of her routine prenatal care. an ultrasound is also necessary to determine if there is more than one fetus present. in your sisters case, if she conceived in november, the measurements of her uterus at this point would be accurate. so i would recommend that she have an ultrasound exam (which i am sure will be done soon as part of her routine prenatal care) to confirm her due date and the viability of the pregnancy. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes to your sister for her pregnancy,"

"hello a am having pain deep inside my shoulder . it has been long term pain . it started about 5 years ago . a did 6 months of physical therapy . it got better but has recently been much worse after throwing a lightweight ball at a high velocity . it is like a deep achy pain . it gets fatigued very very easily . with certain movements it feels as though it is sliding in and out of the socket . there is also tenderness . a have meloxicam from a previous injury that a have been taking , but it has not made any difference .",1,24397,"there are quite a long list of other therapies for the pain. the operation issue intrigues me because the shoulder and the back are not connected. and the shoulder if it is the part down below the neck is inside the chest and doesn't get much wear and tear. if it is at the neck, then neck disk disease is very, very common and almost always shows up on regular x-rays. but. has nothing to do with back and legs in the vast majority. back to pain management: there are multiple levels. obviously the first level is what is broken and fixing it with the surgery. the second level is the pain produced from the problem. nerve pills sometimes work. muscle relaxants sometimes work. amitriptyline is both a nerve pill (like lidocaine) and a blocker of pain signals at the spine. the third level is the context in which the pain is held. while lately everyone is talking about mindfulness and yoga, frankly you might as well try a fidget spinner. i am highly dubious about all of them. but, having the pain be directed by oneself and having it decrease is known to be among the most effective modulators of pain. so, if you can do exercise or physical therapy in the context of making it painful, then the pain experience is less after creating the pain and with repeating it the pain goes down (except during the physical therapy where it goes up for the first 2 months then stabilizes but is still painful)."

a have been drinking quite a lot of energy drinks recently to get me through my exams but a have recently been unable to get an erection when with my girlfriend . a have never had this problem before so a was wondering whether the energy drinks have affected my ability to get an erection ?,1,54211,"dear service user, thanks for writing to chat doctor. i can understand your concern about loss of erection, inability to ejaculate hence unable to have pregnancy. ability to have sufficient erection and ejaculation during masturbation and not with the partner suggests psychological factors playing role behind this. occasional failure can occur to almost every man in his life. when this happens, one gets concerned about performance during next sexual encounter. he thinks whether he would be able to satisfy the partner or not. so, his mind thinks mostly about quality of erection and performance. for constant erection continuous exciting/romantic/erotic feelings should be there in mind. if mind is diverted to concern about erection (being scared in your case), you will lose erection. this in turn reduces your confidence, and it again affects the erection. behavior therapy like senate focus under guidance of psychiatrist will help you. wish you good health."

"hello doc , am having once scares in a face .is it worth buying mesoderm cream to reduce scares ? will they cause any side effects , if so tell me about that .",1,23925,"hello, thanks for writing your query to us. plasma is dark skin discoloration, which particularly occurs in women. mesoderm skin whitening cream is a natural product. this plasma treatment makes use of natural products and ingredients such as licorice extract, lemon juice extract, mulberry extract, vitamin b3 and emilia powder. all these ingredients are naturally extracted and used to produce the skin whitening cream. the cream helps in reducing the production of melanin. melanin is a substance formed due to excessive skin exposure in the sun, and the mesoderm plasma treatment helps to obstruct the formation of melanin. use of mesoderm for plasma treatment is not without side effects. depending on how your skin reacts to the natural ingredients, the cream can cause mild irritation sometimes. consult with your doctor first and know about your skin type. a doctor will be able to tell you whether the ingredients of the mesoderm treatment can cause any skin problems or not. take care."

"hi , in 14 , i had intercourse on the 18th of last month . i took the morning after pill the next day , then about 6 days later , i started bleeding , and it lasted 7 days . i haven got my first period yet . yesterday , i got heartburn , but it lasted for about 3 seconds . i feel lemma and headache today . in really paranoid about pregnancy , could this cause the symptoms ?",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

had biopsy of a enlarged lymph node it came back negative . but when i asked the the nurse if it was due to a infection in theory she said she did not think so and to follow up a act scan in the months . but my concern is what to do mean while because i was thinking that it was just a infection . but they are saying they done think so .,1,56216,"hi thanks for choosing chat doctor for your medical query. i'm sorry but your question is deficient in a lot of information that would have been very helpful for me to answer. you have not mentioned if this was the first episode of pain, or she has past history. you did not mention if she hd any accompanying symptoms like diarrhea, vomiting, blood in stool or vomits, fever, pallor or jaundice. was her abdomen tender to touch? has the pain gotten worse, or it has subsided in intensity? is it only present in the upper abdomen or has it shifted to some other area or extended further? you also did not specify which tests and scans were ordered and came out negative. i can infer that the pain was very severe from the fact that she was hospitalized. upper abdominal pain can be due to a number of causes she might have pancreatitis, cholecystitis or peptic ulcer. pancreatic enzyme levels, ultrasound scan and h pylori antigen should be performed to rule out these conditions. as you have mentioned she had work up done at a hospital so i assume she was evaluated for these conditions. if all other tests are normal she may have functional abdominal pain. it is common amongst girls between the ages of 5 years to 14 years. it is because of an altered mechanism for pain perception so that the affected individual is more sensitive to pain. no definitive cause for this pain can be found but that does not mean it's not real. it usually presents in anxious child chat doctor. it is usually accompanied by other symptoms like recurrent diarrhea, constipation and headaches. the usual sites are around the umbilicus and in the upper abdomen. if your child has been worked up fully for all serious condition the best course of action is to reassure her. try to eliminate stress as much as possible, incorporate soluble fibers in her diet. probiotics are also helpful. do not limit her activities due to pain and try not to let her miss school. talk to her teachers and explain to them the situation. do not dismiss her pain as nothing, acknowledge its presence but try to make your child see that she has to continue her activities in a normal fashion. hope my answer helps you if you have any father questions i would be happy to answer."

my granddaughter is 23 years old . she fell at work and cleaning chemicals ( she works cleanup at a hog processing plant ) splashed and she swallowed some . they had her rinse her mouth out and the burning finally went away . she was not sent for medical attention . now she is coughing up blood . seems to be quite a bit . she went to or but they seem to be afraid to touch her . she she be taken to or in bigger hosp .,1,64560,"hi, it's possible that your mothers coughing fits account to be normal, since it was a chat doctor. i would advise giving her only semisolid food that will be easy on her food pipe and her gut since she is prone to hemorrhoids. it will be easier for her to swallow and digest if the food is more soft and watery. her age is the reason her gastrointestinal tract must be narrowing, hence sometimes when swallowed too fast, food can go to the wrong pipe(viz air pipe), causing a coughing impulse, since the epiglottis is sensitive, and it responds to touch by a cough impulse. hence, i would say it is nothing to worry about, when she gets this coughing spell out her in a position where she can cough out everything she swallowed since it is necessary to avoid aspirating food. after the spell, and only after the spell has subsided, and she has thrown out all food, and she is in her senses, give her a glass of water that she can slowly sip n swallow, which will ease the healing. take care. good to know you care for your mother."

by 2 year old ( she will be 3 in july ) has a fever of 101.6 she is not eating and has committed she is also complaining that her eyes hurt .. should a take her to the doctor ? ? its been one day of feeling this way .. the is 34 pounds and 36 '' tall she was born at 33 weeks ..,1,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"hello doctor , a am young lady who suffer from acute allergy and due to it a suffer from acute sinusitis since young . recently , a visited a different doctor and he prescribed me to be on medication on a long term to control my allergy . the medications are such as rizal 5mg , brian of 500mg , glemont-ir10mg , faraday eye drops , nasonex nasal spray . besides this , a am also consuming doxycyxline to control my acne problem.my question here is that will there be any side effects on taking these medicines on a long term ? will it have any effects on my fertility or development of my babies if i were to be pregnant in future ?",1,74247,"greetings, welcome to chat doctor. chronic sinusitis is a very common condition these days. and people tend to have surgeries to get rid of it, but complete cure is usually not achieved. well there are many reasons for this long term issue but one of the most common problem that i notice in my clinic is that either the patient rides a motorbike and is exposed to fast blowing air or has had history of different allergies to different environmental factors. so foremost question here would be if you have either of these problems. secondly these problems is also common in those people who are used to keep the temperature of their air conditions of the car, office or the house very low. as they shift from cooler environment like the indoor to outside heat there is sudden change in temperature which worsens nasal congestion and hence sinusitis worsens.therefore, i would suggest that instead of taking too much of medication and surgeries, you should take care of all the above-mentioned factors and avoid mucus collection in the sinus altogether. to avoid allergies, it is advisable to visit an allergy clinic and sensitization protocols should be followed to reduce episodes of sinusitis due to allergies like pollen allergies. i hope the answer was helpful. in case of further assistance, feel free to contact in writing. chat doctor."
