"my grand daughter was premature , born at 7 and a half months gestational age . the was drinking milk well but from 8 months of age she started vomiting her food and she a taking landon junior , but even today at 10 months of age she doesn't eat semi solid food without liquefying it .",1,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"i , a am 37 weeks and 1 day pregnant and a was masturbating using only one finger . a was also laying on my back . all of a sudden a felt fluid run down in two pulses and did to feel like it as coming out of the pee hole . it was maybe the volume of about 1/2 cup total . when a smelled it , it was hard to tell if it smelled like urine or not . a have no had any contractions yet . to you think this was waters breaking ? ? should a wait and see if more comes out or if contractions start ?",1,8772,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the proper way to use the nearing is to put it in, leave it in for 3 weeks, take it out, wait one week, and replace it. during the week you are not wearing the ring, you should have some bleeding that is considered a menstrual cycle. if you wore the ring continuously for two months and then had a new one replaced but only removed it 3 days later, the pinkish spotting was your ""period"", which is caused by not wearing the ring. the bleeding was very light because you had suppressed it by continuously wearing the ring for over 2 months. so you should expect your next period about 4-5 weeks after the episode of spotting that you had. if you do not have menses by then, i recommend repeating the pregnancy test at that time. if you did not have regular monthly cycles before you used the ring, your cycle will follow your regular pattern that you typically have when not using hormonal contraception. if you are trying to get pregnant, you should have intercourse about every other day and begin taking prenatal vitamins as it benefits the health of the baby for the vitamins to be present at conception. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"i have been having heart palpitations for several weeks now . they are not constant and seem to occur later in the day . i can feel my heart fluttering , skipping and feel it beating in my throat . it makes me feel short of breath and gives me a headache instantly .",1,25338,"hello and thank you for using chat doctor. i carefully read your question and understand your concern. but you should not worry, its nothing serious. as you describe, my opinion is that it might be a rhythm issue. someone can feel strong and fast heart beats for different reasons. it may be a simple sinus tachycardia. this means that the heart is beating faster than 100 beats for minute. its normal range in a resting condition is between 60-100 beats for minute. when it goes up you may feel a strong heart beat in your chest and a sensation like your body is beating too. another reason for this sensation might be what we call an ekstrasystol.these is electrical heart impulses that generates in some parts of heart different from normal sinus rhythm. this generates an escaped beat that the person feels like jumping ore bumping. it gives the sensation like a beat is skipping, may experience palpitations or an anxiety sensation that your daughter explains like trembling. this extrasistoles may happen from different reasons from simple emotional stress to other pathologies like anemia, hyperthyroidism etc. so, my opinion as cardiologist is that you have nothing to worry. it is just a simple episode, and it is quite normal in younger ages. only if these symptoms persist and begins to interfere the daily live, if i was your treating doctor i will recommend some examinations like a blood analysis to exclude anemia, the thyroid hormones, an electrocardiogram, echocardiography and of course a holder monitoring. this will help us to document and see what happens with heart rhythm. at meantime, i will recommend your daughter to avoid coffee, caffeine products because they rise heart frequency and extrasistolic beats. i encourage her to have physical training because sometimes it helps in reducing extrasistoles, tachycardia, even making them disappear. wish i was helpful. take good care. best regards"

a have a lump on the thyroid cartilage left side a believe it has been there for several years however if became sore to touch and swallow the soreness was gone in 2-3 days lump is still there and may be somewhat increased in size what is the likely cause,1,33931,"hi michele jacobi the first thing that has to be done once you find a lump in the region of the chest wall is to confirm what it is. in your case a biopsy has already been done and let us await its result. you're understanding that cancerous lumps don't bleed after biopsy is correct. but i think your presumption that if it was scar tissue it would have bled is not correct. scar tissue also need not bleed. needle biopsies do not usually cause any bleeding unless a blood vessel is ruptured during the procedure since how long have you noticed this lump. is the size of the lump increasing ? if the biopsy comes as positive for cancer then you will have to undergo a series of investigation to find out he the extent of the disease. ? whether it is confined to the chest wall only or whether it has gone beyond the chest wall to other regions. treatment decision will depend on the results of this if the biopsy comes as negative for cancer then there are 2 options 1- if your physician thinks it is insignificant then you need to follow it up. just keep a check on your lump to see whether it is increasing in size and also get it checked by your physician regularly2- the second option (and my preference) is to do an open biopsy especially if the lump was detected recently and is increasing in size and also if the lump is firm to hard (and not very soft). the reason is needle biopsy can be negative, but this does not always mean there is no cancer especially if the tissue sample taken is not adequate. also time factor is important. you may lose time keeping the lump under follow up to see whether it is increasing in size hope you are satisfied with my reply. anyway don't worry. follow your doctors' advice chat doctor."
a have a lump on the thyroid cartilage left side a believe it has been there for several years however if became sore to touch and swallow the soreness was gone in 2-3 days lump is still there and may be somewhat increased in size what is the likely cause,2,31995,"hello, i can understand your concern. painful bump in front of ear could be due to infection of the ear or related to tmj. it would have been more helpful if you had mentioned exactly what problem you have been suffering from related to tmj for several years. however, if you are having pain in opening and closing jaws, side to side movements of lower jaw, while chewing, if the joint makes clicking/popping sounds while opening, then it is more likely that the lump is related to tmj. you are already suffering from tmj problems, so it is more likely the cause. in that case, you should visit an oral and maxillofacial surgeon for physical examination of the joint and further investigations to pinpoint the cause and treat it. if you are having pain in ear, suffering from cold, no tmj related symptoms etc., then the infection is more likely to be located in the ear. in that case, visiting an ent specialist would be helpful. do not worry regarding anything serious as the bump is in the lymph node area and painful, so it is related to infection and can be cured with course of antibiotics. as you are in pain, you can take ibuprofen 400 mg or motorola 10 mg up to thrice a day to have relief. i would caution you against doing heat application over the area, as the infection may worsen. i hope this information helps you. thank you for choosing chat doctor. i wish you feel better soon. best,"

by baby is two a half month old .. my breast feed is very low and a have to give formula milk to fulfill her requirement.bt a done know how much quantity should be given to my baby in each feed and its preparation coz as direction on roman ... feed seems concentrated,1,174,"thanks for posting on chat doctor. breast milk is the best possible food for a baby and there can be no alternatives for that. lactose or any other formula, is cow milk based and difficult to digest for the baby. so, in such a condition, the baby often vomits it out. try not to go for formula feeds and go for breastfeeding as far as you can. you may express your breast milk and store it in a refrigerator before you bring it to the normal temperature and give to the baby. in case of breastfeeding, insert the entire nipple along with the areola (not only the nipple) in the babies mouth. feed one breast at a time and alternate breasts with each feed. breast milk is produced as per the demands of the baby as express through the suckling. in case of formula feeding, the hunger of the baby is reduced, and the baby suckles less automatically reducing the amount of breast milk produced. so, reduce formula feeds as far as you can. the adequacy of the feeds would be expressed with the amount of urine passed. passing urine at least 5-6 times in 24 hours is to be considered adequate. hope that helps. feel free to revert with further queries if any."

(we call this osmosis phenomenon). for this effect, we need to check the blood sugar at midnight around 2am or so. if this midnight glucose level is very low, then we have to decrease your night insulin levels. therefore, the best for you is to go immediately to your treating doctor and adjust the insulin dose you are taking. regards"

by dad has gone through a major brain amperage .. there was a big blood clot on the right side of the brain .. neurosurgeon removed the clot and the operation took 6 hours long .. its been around 72 hours past after the operation and still hes in unconscious state .. hes in icu and is on life support system .. ecg was done 12 hours back and it does to show any activity in the brain .. are there any further treatment that can be followed to make the brain go active again ? or what is to be done next ?,1,104553,"hi, as you mentioned the symptoms it looks like the patient had an early stroke. during the brain stroke every single minute is important. stroke can be assessed by experiencing the slurred speech, slowing of motor functions, unable to respond to commands. the first thing need is to get admit to a nearby hospital with a ct or an mri facility. if the brain stroke is on the left side on the ct or mri scan than the symptoms will be on the opposite side due to the pyramidal tracts of the nervous system. the design of the human body and its control system by nature is made such that left side of the brain support the right side of the body. once stroke comes rushing into and emergency room is always advised. within 3 hours of the first symptom noticed is of priority and importance. any delay in every minute will damage the brain more. as the blood supply to the brain is restricted by the clot and the damage to the neural tissues keeps continuing. so as soon as one notices the symptoms the earliest you should reach to the emergency room and start the treatment. well, what could have lead to stroke will be the high blood pressure findings are in common. ecg can be normal can be abnormal. ecg is done to rule out certain factors and focus the whole treatment plan on the brain stroke. that is the reason the ecg is always taken. brain stoke can be confined by symptoms and later my mri or a ct scan. post stroke if the physical disability is found then a physical therapist is taken into consideration along with the medication prescribed by the neurologist and the cardiologist. if patient has diabetes than a planetologist should be contacted for the medical part. i hope i have answered your query. if any you have in particular to ask or didn't understand i will surely help you in it."

i took postinor2 about 2yrs ago as directed on the packet and i got pregnant . after that episode a took both pills together and after a couple of days my cycle starts again . recently a used the pills and experience lot of cramps on the right side in my pelvic area and my right leg . even contraction pains in my uterus . that can be the cause of this ....,1,105473,"hi, thanks for the query. since you have used birth control pills irregularly and also used plan b, it is difficult to predict when you will have a period. even with this, in most cases, for women using birth control pills, periods will come only after the active pills are over despite using plan b in the middle of the cycle. plan b works in more than 90% cases if taken properly. concomitant use of both does not decrease the efficacy of plan b, and it still works. it works by delaying ovulation and changing the lining of the uterus to prevent pregnancy from occurring. it does not work if pregnancy has already occurred. the best way to know if you are pregnant in this case would be to take a pregnancy test at least 3-3 1/2 week after using plan b using a morning urine sample. if it is negative, chances of pregnancy resulting from the sexual act on that day [before you took plan b] are negligible. another way to know is wait for your period while taking the sugar pills, if it is delayed a pregnancy test 7 days after the missed period will help. hope you find this useful. thanks for using chat doctor, and have a good day. chatdoctor bagdeconsultant obstetrician and gynecologist"

"sharp pain on the left side of my chest . hurts to breath , bend over , lie down , and when there is any kind of force big or small against it . its been on and of for several months but lately for the past 3weeks its been constant non stop pain all day everyday . why is this happening ?",1,44855,"greetings. welcome to chat doctor, and thank you for your question. i understand your concern. your age would help me a lot in constructing a differential diagnosis. however, i will explain some forms of chest pain, which we aim to exclude first, as the main and most dangerous organic causes of it. first, there is angina. angina is a moderate-to-severe chest pain, more characterized like a heaviness or tenderness or ""squeezing"" feeling, localized in the mid-chest, and then radiates to the both sides of the chest, the jaw, left shoulder and left arm. this is the pain originated from one or more blockages within the coronary arteries (arteries that supply the heart muscle with oxygen and nutrients). if this is your case, you should perform an ekg and an echocardiogram, and, depending on these two tests, a cardiac stress test. second, there is sharp, stabbing pain. this kind of pain can come from an enlargement of the root of the aorta and/or from aortic aneurysm. it is severe in intensity, and radiates to the back, between the wings. also, it can be caused by an acute or chronic inflammation to the linings within the rib cage, i.e. the pleura (lining of the lungs) and pericardium (the lining of the heart). this kind of pain - pleuritic pain - is less severe than that caused by aortic aneurysm, and relieves or aggravates from switching positions or the respiratory cycle. if this is the case, then echocardiogram (for pericardium and root of the aorta), chest x-ray (for the pleura and the lungs), and computed tomography of the aorta (in case we suspect that there is a problem with the aorta, higher than its root), should be performed. there is always a possibility of intercostal (between ribs) muscle or pectoral (chest) muscle soreness, and pain originated from problems with ribs and rib joints. if this is the case, you can use over the counter painkillers. i hope i was thorough with my answer. best regards."
"sharp pain on the left side of my chest . hurts to breath , bend over , lie down , and when there is any kind of force big or small against it . its been on and of for several months but lately for the past 3weeks its been constant non stop pain all day everyday . why is this happening ?",2,21962,"dear simone, there is one rule for doctors here in croatia: when you think too much, stop, and think again, but this time think for the simplest diagnose. if you have pain in abdomen and an umbilical hernia seen on us then the first thing to think about is ""abdominal pain caused by hernia"":). there are many conditions in medicine where pain doesn't need to beau localized near the ""pathology"". sometimes pain can be felt on the opposite side of the affected organ. it is known that one of common symptom of myocardial infarction is pain in the left shoulder. also, infection of the abdominal organs can give many types and localizations of pain. the reason for it is simple: when i see pain, i see nerves, not organs (this is my own phrase:)). nerves conduct pain, and nerves are all around, going from periphery to the brain, so pain can be localized on its pathway, so just let's go back to your problem. doctor should tell you the size of hernia and its content which can be only preperitoneal tissue, momentum or even intestines. this dark triangle...mmm.it can be nothing and everything. i usually don't trust our ultrasonographer because they are strange people... sometimes they don't see what they need to see, or they see what they don't need to see. all i see is that us is operator-dependent diagnostic test... but we shouldn't underestimate this finding. it can be uterine moma, endometriosis, cyst or tumor. and yes, it can cause pain you're describing. so what you need to do: 1. ct scan of pelvic and abdominal region. why? as i said, these us findings are always doubtful, ct is a high sensitive test which will find the exact problem for sure. it will tell you the size and severity of hernia and the morphology of this uterine lesion. it can also find some other problems in its early phase."

"by friend kicked me on the chest recently and my chest has been hurting . over since that happened , a have a hard time trying to eat and when a do , a would feel like a puking . however , a ended up puking the food that a ate today and in addition to small blood .",1,77258,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the sensation of feeling something stuck in your throat is a symptom of reflux-when the food that you eat or the acid in your stomach can back up and irritate it. this is common when you have a large belly at full term because your stomach is being pushed up towards your chest and also the hormones from the pregnancy cause the top opening of your stomach that connects to your esophagus to be looser, so food and acid can leak more easily. the best way to try to control this is to eat only small amounts at one time and to make sure you sit up for at least 2 hours after meals. taking antacids, which for the most part are all safe during pregnancy, can also help. trying to cough up what you feel in your throat will not help because there is not actually something solid coming up. these symptoms may be difficult to treat, but the good news is the symptoms will get better after you have the baby. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

"i had one ( 1 ) of injection for lower back stiffness and pain 6 days ago . it is one of series of three . the next one is to be injected on august 20th . my question is about the drug piroxicam , i was taken it up to four days before the injection then i had to stop for the injection . my i now resume the medication until four days before the next injection .",1,98329,"hi, i guess you concern is about follicular development and about the injection. usually a scan to assess follicular size is done from the 10th day of menstrual cycle. this scan is done consecutively for 4 to 5 days. it is difficult to comment on the follicular size based on 2 days scanning. so it is difficult for me to comment on your follicular size query. still, 11.7 mm on two different scan days may tell inadequate follicular development. however, your follicle may increase in size in next few days and in the scan report it may show that your follicles are developing. so it is difficult to comment on these two scan findings. your next concern about the injection. usually the standard protocol is to give injection 16-20 mm sized follicle to rupture. though, based on the treating doctor practical experience, he may decide the timing of injection. my advice:1. get consecutive 4 to 5 days scan done to comment on the follicular development.2. request your treating doctor to discuss freely about the timing of injection. i hope this information is useful, informative and helpful. let me know if i can assist you further."

by 5 month old granddaughter is staying the weekend with me and started running a fever of 100 . the started late yesterday afternoon not wanting to take her bottle - or seemed to have a hard time with it and will only eat a few bites of food with a spoon . the is little fussy but is still smiling and playing . she did take an unusual amount of naps yesterday and today but never slept more than 30 min . how do i know if she is teething or her throat is hurting ?,1,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

a a new to taking try sprinter . a take it religiously and the first pack a had my period 3 days before placebo week . this month however a a on my second placebo pill and no period . an a take a urinary pregnant test to ease my mind . and will it give me a true result or will the birth control force it to record positive because of the hormones in the try sprinter ?,1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"hello doctor ... my dad undergone a blood clot surgery in head last week.opertion went successful but there is still bleeding in the head , doctors are saying it all go away after time.is that true and also wat precautions we need to take further after surgery",1,49825,"hi, thanks for writing in. buccal mucosa cancer is treated with surgery in early stages. in recurrence after few months or years also surgery is done if possible and then followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy. what happens is some amount of cancer cells are still in the region and not eradicated by surgery. to destroy them completely, chemotherapy and radiation therapy is given to most patients of buccal mucosa cancer. survival in cancers of the head and neck region is better than most other cancers if detected in the early stage. since your doctor has told that your mother can go for another flap surgery therefore it is still in the early stage. survival is good, and many people continue to lead a near normal life after surgery. the 5-year survival even in stage 4 buccal mucosa cancer is more than 36 percent. therefor please get her surgery done and follow-up treatment, and she will recover. please do not worry."

good evening or ! by niece is 4 yrs old and has allergic asthma triggered by smoke and cold air . the has been prescribed wylosone 10 my when the attack comes . the keeps coughing and is unable to sleep and even if she does sleep one can hear her breathing in the entire house- it is so loud . recently there has been loss of hair also . is it because of her medicine ?,1,64560,"hi, it's possible that your mothers coughing fits account to be normal, since it was a chat doctor. i would advise giving her only semisolid food that will be easy on her food pipe and her gut since she is prone to hemorrhoids. it will be easier for her to swallow and digest if the food is more soft and watery. her age is the reason her gastrointestinal tract must be narrowing, hence sometimes when swallowed too fast, food can go to the wrong pipe(viz air pipe), causing a coughing impulse, since the epiglottis is sensitive, and it responds to touch by a cough impulse. hence, i would say it is nothing to worry about, when she gets this coughing spell out her in a position where she can cough out everything she swallowed since it is necessary to avoid aspirating food. after the spell, and only after the spell has subsided, and she has thrown out all food, and she is in her senses, give her a glass of water that she can slowly sip n swallow, which will ease the healing. take care. good to know you care for your mother."

hello a have been on the birth control pill for a year and am not getting ready to start ivf treatment . by fsh was 2.3 and my amh was 1.1 what does this mean and are my levels low because of birth control pill . also a turned 39 two months ago and never had a problem getting pregnant but a always miscarried because both my tubes are blocked .,1,26444,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, i want to reassure you that if you have been taking your birth control pills as directed and you didn't miss any that the chances of your being pregnant are tiny. the failure rate of birth control pills in general is about 1 in 200 per year, meaning one out of 200 women has a chance of getting pregnant on the pill over the course of a year. many women can miss periods for reasons not due to pregnancy. your period can be affected by diet, traveling or changes in your schedule, and especially stress. even worrying about pregnancy can cause enough stress to delay your cycle. also, some women stop menstruating completely when they have been on the pill for a long time, especially low-dose pills like the microgynon you are taking. i suggest you purchase a urine pregnancy test (the over-the-counter ones are just as accurate as a doctor's office) and follow the package directions. if you are not pregnant, you can just wait and see what happens with your cycle and even if you never bleed just start your new pack on time, and you will be protected against pregnancy. if your irregular periods continue to bother you, you may want to see your gun provider who may be able to prescribe a different pill for you that may help you have predictable cycles. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"
hello a have been on the birth control pill for a year and am not getting ready to start ivf treatment . by fsh was 2.3 and my amh was 1.1 what does this mean and are my levels low because of birth control pill . also a turned 39 two months ago and never had a problem getting pregnant but a always miscarried because both my tubes are blocked .,2,27194,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. tri-sprintec is a birth control pill that has a traffic regimen; which means that each color pill in the package has a slightly different dose of hormones. occasionally, women who take traffic pills may have some spotting in the first few days after each pill strength changes over the course of the month. this may cause some slight bleeding or spotting when were not supposed to have your period. whenever you had vaginal bleeding, regardless of the cause, usually there is some cramping that accompanies it. furthermore, it is not unusual to have irregular bleeding or spotting in the first 3 months of pill use. both sprinter and tri-sprintec are considered low-dose birth control pills, however there are many brands on the market that have a lower dose of estrogen than the pill you are currently taking. so you may have less irregular bleeding and spotting on a different kind of monophasic (same dose all month) birth control pill. regarding pregnancy, the chance of your conceiving while taking birth control pills and using a condom is basically nonexistent. so i believe the symptoms you were experiencing are side effects due to the new birth control pill. if your desire is for lighter, regular periods, a different brand of monophasic pill may work better for you with fewer side effects. i hope i was able to adequately answer questions today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"hi , my wife a period started on 30th july 2014 and today the very 6th day we had sex unprotected , though i din ejaculate inside ( took out at the time of ejaculation ) , i wanted to know what are the chances of having pregnancy , should she take unwanted72 , and , she is 23 years old , and have never taken any pills like that , pleasehelp",1,52155,"hello dear, i understand your concern. in my opinion as she had regular cycles the 3rd july comes under safe period. safe period is the one where in there is less scope for pregnancy even with semen ejaculation inside the vagina. so don't worry. there are rare or nil chances of pregnancy. if her expected period is on 23rd of july the ovulation day will be probably on 9th and the fertile or unsafe period comes to be between 6th july to 12th july. it is calculated by subtracting 14 days from expected date i.e. 23-14 =9. so 9th is ovulation date and 3 days on either side of it comes under unsafe period. so the unsafe and safe periods can be calculated by above method. and this is applicable to only regular cycles. and according to this 3rd july comes under safe period. so relax. hope this helps. best regards..."

"a am 5 weeks and 2 days pregnant , apart from breast tenderness/ pain , urination ( i generally drink lot of water ) , have no other symptoms . had a miscarriage last year and very worried with no symptoms whether a am of or not . a had a hard stool today but after an hour had a soft stool again , which haunt happened since a got to know that a am pregnant .",1,10535,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. pregnacare conception is simply a combination of vitamins that help a woman have a healthy pregnancy from conception. it has no hormonal effects and should not have any impact on the regularity of your cycle nor your ability to conceive, it is not unusual for women to bleed on and off for even 6 weeks after a miscarriage so the 19-day bleeding episode you had may not have actually been a menstrual period but still could have been bleeding leftover for your d and c. so you may not be ""late"" at all, but may just have not had a real period since the pregnancy. there is no reason to assume you would have problems getting pregnant again since you have conceived naturally twice in the last year. either way, the pregnancies conception vitamins have nothing to do with your irregular bleeding. it is generally advisable to wait to try to conceive again after your first real period-so i would wait until you bleed again to resume trying to conceive. if you do not get a real period by 3 months from your last bleeding episode, you should follow up for your gun for a re-evaluation of your hormones and treatment with progesterone, which can restart your period cycling. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful. best wishes,"

last year a my doctor said a had lyme but was puzzled as a had lyme in previous years but the antibody did not show . that was the third time a had lyme . a am not feeling symptoms of extreme tiredness shortness of breath . this happened at the same time every year . that else could this be .,1,59679,"hello dear. lyme disease is related to painful rashes on armpit and thigh, but may not be related to brain scarring. lyme disease is usually curable with antibiotics. this is so true that some authors of lyme disease research have stated that the most common cause of lack of response of lyme disease to antibiotics is a lack of lyme disease to begin with! the type of antibiotic depends on the stage of the disease (early or late) and what areas of the body are affected. early illness is usually effectively treated with medications taken by mouth, for example, doxycycline (tobramycin), amoxicillin (mobil), or cefuroxime acetic (certain). these generally result in a rapid cure of lyme disease. therefore, if a person finds a typical bulls-eye skin rash (described above) developing in an area of a tick bite, they should seek medical attention as soon as possible. generally, antibiotic treatment resolves the rash within one or two weeks with no long-term consequences. later illness such as nervous-system disease might require intravenous chat doctor. there are no home remedies to treat lyme disease. in those people with two or more episodes of erythema migrant rash, even years apart, it is felt that the episodes represent different infections or reinfection rather than persistence of the original infection. for relief of lyme disease symptoms, pain-relieving medicines might be added. swollen joints can be reduced by the doctor removing fluid from them (arthrocentesis). an arthrocentesis is a procedure whereby fluid is removed from a joint using a needle and syringe under sterile conditions. it is usually performed in a doctor's office. rarely, even with appropriate antibiotics, the arthritis continues. it has been suggested by researchers that sometimes joint inflammation can persist even after eradication of the lyme bacteria. this complication has been explained as an ongoing autoimmune response causing inflammation of the joint that was initially stimulated by the original bacterial infection. oral medications such as ibuprofen (motrin, turin) can also be used to reduce inflammation and improve function. there is no evidence that nonspecific fatigue that persists after treatment for lyme disease is related to persistent infection. the risks of prolonged treatments with antibiotics are far greater than any benefit in this situation. of note, recent research was done to study whether longer-term antibiotic treatment of persistent symptoms of lyme disease led to any better outcomes than shorter-term treatment. the study found that longer-term antibiotic treatment did not have additional beneficial effects on health-related quality of life beyond those with shorter-term treatment. specifically, the researchers determined that this longer-term antibiotic treatment had no more beneficial effect on fatigue, or musculoskeletal, neuropsychological, or cognitive symptoms and disorders from lyme disease than placebo hope i have answered your question. feel free to contact me if you have any more questions. i'll be glad to help you. all the besting warm regards"

i started with a toothache after a filling . now a have pain in my big toe and under my foot and instep . a few of my toes feel numb like a have been sitting on them too long . the is a swollen gland just under the tooth . this gets big or small at different times . this has happened for years . the pain is on the same side as the toothache . it is worse at night,1,13930,"hello, and thank you for your question. fortunately, you probably do not have fibromyalgia. there are several possible causes of pain just in the toe. if there is a pinched nerve in the lower spine, it can cause pain that can be just in one toe. if this is the case, you may find that the pain is worse with change in position, such as lying flat or standing up. pain in the toe, typically the big toe, is common in a disorder called gout, in which the body has too much uric acid. the pain usually lasts a few days at a time, and is usually associated with redness and swelling. pain in the toes can be caused by corns or other skin problems that look small but feel very severe. pins and needles, shooting, on-and-off pains can be caused by irritation to a nerve by diabetes, by lack of vitamins such as b12, or by pressure - similar to the ""foot falling asleep"" feeling we sometimes get if we cross our legs too long. fibromyalgia, on the other hand, is usually a ""pain all over"" problem - back pain, neck pain, arm pain, knee pain, without another cause such as arthritis. it usually does not cause just one part of the body to hurt - most patients say that ""everything hurts"". in my practice, i start with finding out as much as i can from the patient about how the pain feels and how long it has been going on, and if it seems related to anything else. then we examine the foot to look for anything going on with the skin, check if the nerves of the foot are normally sensitive, not as sensitive as usual, or more sensitive, and then we may check blood tests to detect diabetes or vitamin deficiency or other problems as needed. fibromyalgia is diagnosed by obtaining a careful history of where the patient is having pain, other medical problems, and completing a physical exam including what is called a ""painful point"" exam where the doctor pushes at certain places in the body - on the back and near the joints - to see if this causes pain. i hope that my answer to your question is helpful. if you have any further questions, please check back with us. i hope your toe is much better soon."

a have a question ? a left the nova ring in for 2 months then i had a or apt and she put a new one in well i took it out 3 days later cause in trying to have a baby . a have had very light spotting it was pinkish . a have taking a home test came back negative but in almost 3 weeks late .,1,8772,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the proper way to use the nearing is to put it in, leave it in for 3 weeks, take it out, wait one week, and replace it. during the week you are not wearing the ring, you should have some bleeding that is considered a menstrual cycle. if you wore the ring continuously for two months and then had a new one replaced but only removed it 3 days later, the pinkish spotting was your ""period"", which is caused by not wearing the ring. the bleeding was very light because you had suppressed it by continuously wearing the ring for over 2 months. so you should expect your next period about 4-5 weeks after the episode of spotting that you had. if you do not have menses by then, i recommend repeating the pregnancy test at that time. if you did not have regular monthly cycles before you used the ring, your cycle will follow your regular pattern that you typically have when not using hormonal contraception. if you are trying to get pregnant, you should have intercourse about every other day and begin taking prenatal vitamins as it benefits the health of the baby for the vitamins to be present at conception. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"by 11 or old daughter has shari 1 malformation and a have seen that canniboid oil has been helping kids with other conditions , my question is has there been any legitimate studies that show if it can help with the pain , insomnia and nausea that are the result of having shari and nerve damage ?",1,8854,"dear friend, i did some basic research and discovered that there are only anecdotal studies on the various benefits of oil extracted from the marijuana plant but hardly any hard-core scientific data. the material on the net shows only relief with inflammatory conditions and some types of cancer. in your children case, neither of these situations apply. rather, the symptoms of pain and insomnia are probably due to compression of nerve roots as they exit the brain. hence, in my humble opinion, i doubt if the cannabinoid oils can do much for the chiara 1 malformation. it might still be possible for you to try it if any recognized institute is planning to conduct trials on this kind of treatment. your child can then join such a trial after completing the requirements for joining it."

"in friday a called 911 and went to emergency by ambulance . after an ecg , x-rays , blood tests , oxygen , and an of , the attending doctor said that the chest pains , neck pain , tingling in my face and shortness of breath had been caused by elevated enzymes in my chest wall . the said it could have come from a strained muscle . but a didst have any muscle strain . that could have caused those symptoms ?",1,18895,"hello, welcome to chat doctor. anteroseptal infarct seen on ecg or ekg = electrocardiogram means that you did have a heart attack = the heart muscle was damaged by a clogged coronary artery and this is what causes the changes seen by the doctors on the ecg recording. these changes are quite specific and characteristic, and it is not likely that other medical conditions like indigestion would have produced them. also, since these changes were seen on several occasions, this makes an anteromedial infarct quite certain. after an infarct the damaged area of the heart muscle undergoes scarring, and it may also result in thickening of that area as seen on the echocardiogram. some patients, especially diabetics, do not have symptoms like chest pain when they are having their heart attacks, so it is possible to just see the ekg changes of an ""old mi"" old myocardial infarction on an ekg while the patient does not even know that they had a heart attack.typically, an acute heart attack causes severe chest pain, shortness of breath and makes one very ill and treatment in the hospital is required, where blood tests are done to confirm a diagnosis of so-called acute mi. hope this helps you understand this issue. wishing you best of health."

"hello air , today when i rubbed the side of my stomach , just above my hips i found a small knot or lump kind of marble shaped tiny ball inside , when i tried to push it , there was some small pain . pm afraid it might be cancer or tutor . however if i done touch it in not having problem , that should i do next , is it any cause of concern . god bless you . best regards",1,74210,"hello! thank you for the query. yes, umbilical hernia can always be a reason of abdominal pain. however, it can be also asymptomatic. hernia is simply a hole in the abdominal wall. when the hole is small, but big enough to let intestine or momentum to get through, the contents of hernia gets squeezed and that is what hurts. so if in your belly button is a lump which hurts when you pres it, that can be the cause of your symptoms. if hernia is empty, it should not hurt at all. if it is about ascites, in most cases it does not hurt at all. the only way it can hurt, is when there is so much liquid inside your abdomen, that intestines gets squeezed, and it can lead to intestine blockage. but it would be easily visible, and your abdomen would become unnaturally big, like with big ball inside. hope this will answer your questions. regards"

hello . a fee burning ( warm ) sensation in the left side of the brain with nick stiffness . also yesterday a walk up speaking jeberesh ( sounds not words ) not sure if there is an correlation . would you please help me decide if there is something to be concerned about ?,1,85630,"hello, your father sounds to be suffering from a spinal nerve being compressed if the problem is clearly over the same half of the head and face and can last as you say for hours at a time. he may be suffering from a cervical neuritis. that's one possibility. the other is that something in the brain could be causing this, so i would recommend obtaining an mri of the brain with gadolinium contrast to see if there could be something intracranial causing these intense pains such as a mass lesion affecting one of the sphenopalatiine ganglia which would give off the trigeminal nerve responsible for sensation of the face (on that side). also, imaging studies of the cervical cord may be necessary to look at the area of the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve to see if that is being compromised in some way. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further. take care chat doctor."
hello . a fee burning ( warm ) sensation in the left side of the brain with nick stiffness . also yesterday a walk up speaking jeberesh ( sounds not words ) not sure if there is an correlation . would you please help me decide if there is something to be concerned about ?,2,724,"hello, there could be a few reasons to your symptoms. since your blood pressure was so low, the first thought is that you were simply not getting enough blood to your brain. from you symptoms it sounds like your left hemisphere of the brain was affected given that you couldn't move your right leg and arm. language also resides most commonly in the left hemisphere, so speaking would also be difficult. you didn't mention your age, but when symptoms are isolated to a side of the brain, what needs to be done is an mr-angiogram (blood vessel imaging with mri) or ct-angiogram (blood vessel imaging with a ct) of the arteries in the neck and brain to make sure that there is no narrowing of the blood vessel that could result in the symptoms just affecting one side of the brain. if neither of those tests are possible, then as a bare minimum a carotid ultrasound should be done. alternatively, but much less likely is that you could have a migraine that caused paralysis and focal neurological symptoms. they are very rare, but still a possibility. the symptoms usually resolve in a few hours to a day. lastly, a seizure could have also occurred which caused you to lose consciousness. there is a condition where after the seizure, it takes the brain time to recover and there can be difficulty with movement and language. again, i feel that that is less likely. none-the-less you need more testing done to make sure the blood vessel are open. also, they need to investigate the cause of your low blood pressure. it can be due to a chat doctor. you should definitely speak with your primary care physician to have all of that investigated. i hope this helps. sincerely, kristoffer mission"

hello mam in my last cycle egg was not ruptured till 22nd day .its size was increased till 37 mm.in this cycle the size of eggs was not increased on 18th day it was 15.2but on 21 day they got smaller.pls tell me what should i do .,1,50190,"hallow dear, you were given in. chat doctor for induction of ovulation on days 15 and 19. the size of the follicle was 28x30 mm in size on day 19. this is not a good development for conception. what was the dose of chat doctor given to you - 5000 iu or 10000 iu? the follicle should have ruptured after the first chat doctor injection. it did not. moreover, the follicle has grown to quite a big size. follicles of size between 18 mm and 21 mm diameter release the healthiest eggs which have better chances of successful pregnancy. you should try induction of ovulation when the follicle is within this size range. also, please try to look for the thickness of the uterine lining (endometrium) at the time of expected egg release. endometrial thickness between 09 mm and 14 mm is most conducive for implantation of fertilized ovum. i hope you will discuss these issues with your gynecologist."
hello mam in my last cycle egg was not ruptured till 22nd day .its size was increased till 37 mm.in this cycle the size of eggs was not increased on 18th day it was 15.2but on 21 day they got smaller.pls tell me what should i do .,2,13108,"hi, i appreciate your query would clarify the report of your follicular study to you. on the 9th day, in the right and left ovaries (of and lof) - there was no df - which means, dominant follicle. again the same findings persisted till the 13th day, that is there was no dominant follicle in any of the ovaries. et - refers to endometrial thickness which was 8 mm on day 13. collection in pod was nil, which is normal. now, to explain a normal follicular study to you. by day 9, the ovaries start producing dominant follicles, that is among the many eggs present in the ovaries, one starts maturing to develop into the dominant egg for that month. by day 13 generally, if you have a regular 28-day menstrual cycle, the dominant egg reaches a size of 20 - 22 mm. generally on day 14, ovulation occurs, that is the mature dominant egg is released from the ovary, and it is then ready for fertilization by the sperm. this is the normal studyhowever, in your case, there is no dominant follicle seen till day 13, which means that you are having an ovulatory cycle. that is, no mature egg is developing for ovulation this month. anovulatory cycles are a major cause for not being able to conceive.pod (polycystic ovarian disease) is one of the leading causes of an ovulation, apart from other conditions. you need to consult a gynecologist, and undergo further investigations for pod to rule out the cause of this follicular study. also, you might require treatment and ovulation induction (medicines to stimulate formation of follicles in the ovary). in case your cycles are delayed (longer than 28 - 30 days), there is a minor possibility that your follicles are maturing later than normal, for e.g., in a 35-day cycle, the day of ovulation would be 14 days before periods, that is on day 20 or 21. hope this helped you."

"the clinic has changed my pill from falcon ( 5mnths ) , to corvette ( 2 ) month this , in angry al a tom , weepy , light pain on lower abdominal side ( rat ) . spotting , could this a a side effect , on falcon i did have sum problems but they stored after my 3rd cycle .",1,27194,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. tri-sprintec is a birth control pill that has a traffic regimen; which means that each color pill in the package has a slightly different dose of hormones. occasionally, women who take traffic pills may have some spotting in the first few days after each pill strength changes over the course of the month. this may cause some slight bleeding or spotting when were not supposed to have your period. whenever you had vaginal bleeding, regardless of the cause, usually there is some cramping that accompanies it. furthermore, it is not unusual to have irregular bleeding or spotting in the first 3 months of pill use. both sprinter and tri-sprintec are considered low-dose birth control pills, however there are many brands on the market that have a lower dose of estrogen than the pill you are currently taking. so you may have less irregular bleeding and spotting on a different kind of monophasic (same dose all month) birth control pill. regarding pregnancy, the chance of your conceiving while taking birth control pills and using a condom is basically nonexistent. so i believe the symptoms you were experiencing are side effects due to the new birth control pill. if your desire is for lighter, regular periods, a different brand of monophasic pill may work better for you with fewer side effects. i hope i was able to adequately answer questions today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"
