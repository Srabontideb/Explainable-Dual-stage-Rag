a have a 11 yrs old girl . the is having intermittent stomach pain and we took treatment for liver . recently pornography results indicate mild fluid collection in pod and mild enlargement of spleen . does liver dysfunction affect in anyway the spleen . the is having still pain now .,2,87329,"hi, thanks for writing in to us. splenomegaly is a common complication of cirrhosis. many cirrhotics have platelet counts in the 60,000s. it is not something to worry about. and it doesn't need to be treated. you have plenty of platelets to properly clot your blood. blood flows from the spleen...through the portal vein...then through the liver. scar tissue in the liver (cirrhosis) can interfere with that blood flow, causing pressure to build up in the portal vein (portal hypertension), and the spleen to enlarge (splenomegaly). as the spleen enlarges, it traps platelets. (the amount of platelets in the bloodstream is reduced because the spleen is busy trapping them). so usually people with cirrhosis end up having a problem with portal hypertension and an enlarged spleen, and a reduced platelet count in the bloodstream. as time goes by, the liver may try to repair itself by growing new cells. if there is a lot of scar tissue already present the new cells grow between scar tissue (and result in abnormal nodules). the nodules and scar tissue further interfere with blood flow through the liver. so over time people with advanced cirrhosis can end up having a problem with more and more abnormal nodules and scar tissue forming which interferes even more with blood flow through the liver which makes the spleen continue to enlarge, and the platelet count continue to chat doctor. the splenomegaly is usually not reversible. please go for regular medical follow up. hope this helps"

hi i have a four years old daughter and i want to get pregnant for the second time but not able to conceive . name happened during my first pregnancy and my doctor did dnc after which i was able to conceive . now do i have get through the same process or can medicines help me in conceiving ?,2,76346,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. fertomid is a type of fertility medication used help to cause ovulation in women who have trouble getting pregnant. because you did get pregnant (even though you had a miscarriage), unless you have been trying since then for over a year and been unable to conceive, the fatimid medication will not likely increase your chance of pregnancy significantly. therefore, even if you forgot to take some pills, you still have a significant chance of pregnancy as you are still very young, especially if you have regular menstrual cycles. if you and your husband have not been trying to conceive for more than a year on your own, i would not recommend using any fertility medication. using fatimid for more than four menstrual cycles can actually reduce your risk of pregnancy, as it decreases the effect of estrogen on your uterine lining. 80% of healthy couples will conceive within one year if they are having regular (at least 2 to 3 days per week) intercourse without contraception. one in 10 pregnancies will end in miscarriage, which means that 90% of the time couples will conceive a perfectly healthy pregnancy after a miscarriage without any form of medical treatment. so in summary, missing the fatimid tablets this particular month will not likely affect your chance of conceiving this cycle if you already ovulate naturally. i strongly recommend trying to get pregnant naturally for one year before using any type of fertility medication, as your body has proven that you can conceive even though that pregnancy did not work out. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this additional information was helpful. best wishes,"
hi i have a four years old daughter and i want to get pregnant for the second time but not able to conceive . name happened during my first pregnancy and my doctor did dnc after which i was able to conceive . now do i have get through the same process or can medicines help me in conceiving ?,3,43820,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, i want to reassure you that no matter what your endometrial measurement may be, 80% of couples will conceive within one year naturally. couples are not diagnosed as infertile until you have been trying and been unable to become pregnant for over one year. endometrial thickness is really only relevant in the context of couples trying to get pregnant through in vitro fertilization. the thickness of your uterine lining is somewhat related to your estrogen levels. when couples are undergoing ivf, treating with additional estrogen can thicken the uterine lining. however, because you've been only trying to get pregnant for four months, your endometrial lining may have absolutely nothing to do with the reason why you have not yet conceived. furthermore, unless your husbands' sperm count has been shown to be decreased, magazine should not have any effect on fertility nor should affect any health of a developing baby should you conceive. medications taken during pregnancy by the mother can affect the fetus, but not any medication taken by the father, because medication cannot be transmitted before fertilization through sperm. so unless the medication causes the sperm count to be low or abnormal, there is no medical reason why your husband needs to be off his medication for colitis in order for you and need to conceive successfully. i suggest that if he needs the medication for his health that he continue to take it. as for is maximizing your chance of healthy pregnancy, the best thing you can do is get plenty of sleep, eat a well-balanced diet, take prenatal vitamins, and tried to have regular(at least 2 to 3 days a week) unprotected intercourse from the time your menstrual period finishes until you begin to feel premenstrual symptoms. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and i wish you and your husband the best of luck in conceiving. best wishes,"

by daughter has been told she has a blood clot on the outer edge of her brain .. only symptom was a tingling in her cheek ... she is being treated with blood thinners ... and hospitalization for 3 or 4 days ... is this a dangerous situation ? hes had it for several weeks now ....,1,91332,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the complication of getting blood clots in the legs, called a dvt, or groin is uncommon but not rare during pregnancy. normally, the clock will gradually disappear with the aid of blood thinners. it actually takes somewhere between one even more than three months for the clock to actually dissolve and be reabsorbed by the bloodstream. therefore, the symptoms of pain, and swelling in the leg where the blockage occurred are not unusual while this is taking place. the most dangerous complication of a blood clot in the legs for pregnant woman is if a piece of the clot actually breaks off it can travel through the bloodstream towards the lungs and cause serious complications for breathing and sometimes even death. so symptoms your daughter-in-law should watch out for our shortness of breath, chest pain, or feeling very anxious with a rapid heartbeat. in terms of pain control for right now, applying a hot water bottle (comfortably hot) to the groin or soaking in a warm bath can help to relieve the pain symptoms at this time. your daughter-in-law should discuss the further management of her blood clot with her doctor but in the meantime it is much too early to see improvement in the pain. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was helpful. best wishes to your daughter-in-law for the rest of her pregnancy,"

in the morning when a wake up i find it had to breath as when a do there is quite an intense pain below my ribs ( diaphragm ) area and stomach when a push gently between ribs in the middle it a very painful i find a little bit of relief laying on my side but this can also make the pain worse on the side i lay on . a generally sleep on my stomach so i thought it was.probably just that .,1,91109,". i read your question carefully, and i understand your concern. from the information you gave, the first thing i suspect is muscle strain. the suspicion for this condition is even higher after you have done examination, even a ct scan. regarding the amoxicillin therapy, it is an antibiotic and i can't find a reason for taking that, but for sure the doctor that prescribed it had a reason for that. i do have some questions though. is the pain localized in you abdomen or between the lower ribs in your right side. the pain is steady, or it begins or worsens with movement? do you have any swelling or bruising? is it tender when you touch it? if it is more localized between your ribs, it gets worse with movements or sneezing or deep breathing, it might be tender when you touch it than probably it is just muscle strain (as i said you excluded major conditions with examination. besides this, the condition how it started (stretching too much to get something) and an acute onset, all lead to muscle strain. in general, muscle sprain can be treated with rice therapy - rest, ice application, compress and exercise. to alleviate the pain you could take pain medication like ibuprofen or naproxen. it is necessary to limit the movement of the torso (rest, but just the firs days). gentle stretching exercises can help strengthen the muscles. pain can be alleviated applying an ice pack for 15-20 minutes 2-3 times a day (ice should not be in direct contact with the skin). for a full recovery it can take 4-6 weeks. feel free for additional questions. i hope the answer helped you. best regards"

"hello , my daughter has achondroplasia she was born preterm at 28 weeks she is now in scab , a v.p shunt was done for her . the problem is that is still on mechanical ventilator and suffers sudden episodes of denaturation . the has already completed two months . please tell me when she will be able to breath alone ? ?",1,50068,"thanks for your question on chat doctor. i can understand your concern. honestly speaking, her prognosis is very poor. i don't think she will be able to breath without the support of ventilators. you said that she is on mechanical ventilator for 2 months. 2 months is very long duration for ventilation. and prognosis worsens with increase in number of days of ventilation. so she is now ventilator dependent and not taking her breaths by her own. i don't think she will recover from this, so not giving you false hopes. hope i have solved your query. i will be happy to help you further. wishing good health to your daughter. thanks."

"good evening sir .... in suffering the severe pain in my chest and mid stomach part around but not exact stomach , the pain is not the continuous pain but it just happens when i eat or drink means when i swallow sting inn .... sir it pains lot for more than a minute and i take more than half hour to eat even a small quantity of food .... please help me",1,77258,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the sensation of feeling something stuck in your throat is a symptom of reflux-when the food that you eat or the acid in your stomach can back up and irritate it. this is common when you have a large belly at full term because your stomach is being pushed up towards your chest and also the hormones from the pregnancy cause the top opening of your stomach that connects to your esophagus to be looser, so food and acid can leak more easily. the best way to try to control this is to eat only small amounts at one time and to make sure you sit up for at least 2 hours after meals. taking antacids, which for the most part are all safe during pregnancy, can also help. trying to cough up what you feel in your throat will not help because there is not actually something solid coming up. these symptoms may be difficult to treat, but the good news is the symptoms will get better after you have the baby. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

(regular use of emergency pill is harmful)conception occurs if she was in 10th to 18th day of her cycle(in a regular cycle of 28 day duration). you can ask her at what day she is in and wait for next cycle to occur. if it delayed by 7 days then get done upt to diagnose if pregnant and then the required treatment can be taken. regards"

a was bitten by a spider and the symptom that a experienced was of mild tendon and muscle soreness starting in the arm that was bitten . however through the day the pain and soreness moved from the right arm to the right shoulder and chest and then moved to the left shoulder and chest then went away completely . a was wondering what spider could have cause this ?,1,41649,"hello. thank you for your question and welcome to chat doctor. i understand your concern. well, i am going to try and explain the differences between various origins of the pain which can arise from the rib cage. there is angina. it is described more like mid-chest heaviness or squeezing sensation, that is triggered by exercise and relieved by rest, which radiates to the both sides of the chest, to the jaw and left arm and shoulder. it is indicative of a blockage within one or more coronary arteries and reflects the lowering of blood supply to the heart muscle. an ekg obtained in the moment of chest pain, if it fills this description, would be helpful. then there is pleuritic chest pain. this kind of pain is sharp, stabbing pain that can happen in any part of the chest area. no radiation like in anginal pain. it arises from acute or chronic inflammation of the linings that are within the rib cage: pleura (lining of the lungs) or pericardium (lining of the heart) or both. in this regard, i would recommend a chest x-ray for pleural inflammation or effusion. in case of pericardial pain and anginal pain, echocardiogram is helpful, by evaluating the size, motility and function of heart muscle and valves, and also by assessing the pericardium and whether there is fluid build-up within it, or not. other causes of chest pain are related to the locomotion system of the rib cage: muscle soreness, bone and cartilage-related pain. in the end, stress can also cause chest pain. i hope i was helpful with my answer. best regards,"

"a was diagnosed with stage 2a breast cancer in february 2011 . a have had a bilateral mastectomy and chemotherapy and now have saline breast implants . for the past few days , a have been experiencing pain between the 5th and 6th ribs to the left of my sternum . the pain is worse when a breathe . is this costochondritis ? a problem with the implants ? metastasis ? please give me your thoughts . thank you .",1,82366,"hello friend, thank you for posting your query through chat doctor. i am a homeopath answering your query and the answer which i am going to give you may contain several thoughts which may appear strange or new for you. this i say because homeopathy is a new system of medicine and is almost unheard by the majority of the population. therefore, due to the high influence of the conventional medicine the people at large are brainwashed to believe and act according to the health education given by them. coming back to the fibroadenoma of your left breast in the year 1979, you had a psychological conflict in the mind level. you are a sensitive individual and that is why your left breast was affected. it must have been related with your child chat doctor. the sensitivity is genetic, and you reacted to the conflict through the brain according to a genetic programming. mind-brain - organ affection resulted in the development of a lump in your left breast in 1979. you consulted your gynecologist, and he suggested that it may turn to become cancerous in future and so it is better to remove it, and you subdued to his suggestion. actually the lump in the breast was an attempt of the body to cure you, or it was the result of a self defense mechanism. since you had not resolved the conflict in the psychological level, the lump remained there without getting resolved. but the body kept the lump protected in a cyst with minimum amount of inflammation called chronic cystitis. by removing the fibroadenoma or chronic cystic mastitis, you were not cured, but your lump in the breast was removed. in 1995 also you are the same person, you are the same sensitive person, and you underwent another more serious psychological conflict and the same left breast was again affected in a more serious manner. instead of recognizing the mass as a defense mechanism, you got the fear in you that you have cancer. the tissue changes also suggested that there is more serious pathology, and they labelled your lump this time as cancer and suggested removal of your left breast. if you could have recognized the lump as a defense mechanism and if you had no fear of cancer, you could have retained your breast. but the fear of cancer is such that it is associated with death and so you lost your breast. in no case, either by removal of lump in 1979 or by removal of your breast in 1995, you are not cured only your disease is cured. hope by this time you have got the answer for your query. both are related to each other because they are in the same individual, same sensitivity, same program. homeopathy cures the person and once the individual is cured all his diseases will be cured. with best wishes,"

a have a friend who is a borderline sep a case . that can be done to convert him from borderline to negative . the doctor has told him that he should not be worried because it is a borderline case . the doc says that he is a carrier and that there is no medication for it . an someone comment on the case . is this something new ? what have people who were borderline cases done which this friend of mine can do ?,1,47037,"hi there, if he is still having fevers and lethargic, i'd be worried that one of his grafts were infected. sometimes, it takes many weeks or even months to get over a major surgery, but he should start to improve and not decline. blood cultures would be the first place to start, as if he has blood cultures that show infection, i'd be very worried that his arterial grafts were infected. if he has negative blood cultures, that is more reassuring. if his incision is getting better, that's certainly a good sign. i would have a straight forward conversation with the surgeon who did the surgery and ask him why your husband hadn't fully recovered, and what his expectation for his recovery should be. if he's not eating well and having pain, then there are certain things that can be due such as a nasogastric feeding tube, or perhaps even iv nutrition. if he's having pain issues, then he should refer him to a chronic pain doctor. and finally, if he's having fevers, i'd ask the surgeon if he has an infection of the grafts, and if he says no, i'd ask him where he thought the fevers were coming from this far out of surgery. in this case, it sounds like you really have to push your surgeon for answers. no one will know the answers to these questions unless it's the surgeon who did the operation, who should be following him closely. i hope this is helpful. please contact me if you have any further questions."

(this is not a common scenario when compared to encountering an antibiotic resistance). so next spike of fever, kindly take your son to er, and it is better to get him admitted in the hospital, do blood and urine test and cultures and treat accordingly after ruling out other infectionsregards"

i a need help . pm having braces soon because a want my undermine to be fixed . should a get braces or a jaw surgery will be the best way to correct ?

i for the past 3 days a be been having a thick light orange/pink looking discharge and a a not sure what it a from . a get my period in 11 days and it a usually always on time . a a not sure if it a because a recently started taking birth control . thank you for your help !,2,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"i a few days ago a was sleeping and woke up because of a nightmare , at the moment of waking up a heard a pop on the left side of my skull followed by a sharp pain that ran to the back of my head ! it a been a few days and a still feel something a slight pain discomfort !",1,77239,"hi there. looks like your son with the prior history of pain over the far right side of back and difficulty in standing up has developed a spasm of the back muscle. these muscle spasms need not be always related to what the affected individual was doing at the time of having the onset of pain, but can be related to any abnormal posturing such as bending for a long time prior to the onset of the pain which would have fatigued his back muscles. the pop sound he heard or felt could be probably a disc problem that may lead to a secondary spasm, so if he is having a persisting pain radiating to the right side alone and not subsiding with rest and pain medications, kindly get an mri scan of the spine and get him evaluated. so in the acute setting a few days of bed rest, local analgesic ointment, a 3-day course of tramadol should be enough. in case of pain radiating down the leg or the hip, or any weakness of lower limb on one side, get additional scans and get him checked."

"by grandmother was having pain that comes and goes in her lower right abdomen . the though maybe a hernia because it feels like pulling but when pain comes it is severe . when the pain is present she has a metallic taste in her mouth . her doctor ruled out hernia with a sonogram . be seemed not concerned , but it has been persistent and going on for about 7 weeks . that other things could it be that we need to rule out ? thank you for your help",1,56216,"hi thanks for choosing chat doctor for your medical query. i'm sorry but your question is deficient in a lot of information that would have been very helpful for me to answer. you have not mentioned if this was the first episode of pain, or she has past history. you did not mention if she hd any accompanying symptoms like diarrhea, vomiting, blood in stool or vomits, fever, pallor or jaundice. was her abdomen tender to touch? has the pain gotten worse, or it has subsided in intensity? is it only present in the upper abdomen or has it shifted to some other area or extended further? you also did not specify which tests and scans were ordered and came out negative. i can infer that the pain was very severe from the fact that she was hospitalized. upper abdominal pain can be due to a number of causes she might have pancreatitis, cholecystitis or peptic ulcer. pancreatic enzyme levels, ultrasound scan and h pylori antigen should be performed to rule out these conditions. as you have mentioned she had work up done at a hospital so i assume she was evaluated for these conditions. if all other tests are normal she may have functional abdominal pain. it is common amongst girls between the ages of 5 years to 14 years. it is because of an altered mechanism for pain perception so that the affected individual is more sensitive to pain. no definitive cause for this pain can be found but that does not mean it's not real. it usually presents in anxious child chat doctor. it is usually accompanied by other symptoms like recurrent diarrhea, constipation and headaches. the usual sites are around the umbilicus and in the upper abdomen. if your child has been worked up fully for all serious condition the best course of action is to reassure her. try to eliminate stress as much as possible, incorporate soluble fibers in her diet. probiotics are also helpful. do not limit her activities due to pain and try not to let her miss school. talk to her teachers and explain to them the situation. do not dismiss her pain as nothing, acknowledge its presence but try to make your child see that she has to continue her activities in a normal fashion. hope my answer helps you if you have any father questions i would be happy to answer."

a just had an ultra sound done because a had a trace of blood in my urine and when the test was done they found a spot on my left kidney . by creatine levels are on the upper end of normal . a have an appointment for a mri to do look further . are all spots cancer or are there any other things that could create spots ?,1,34445,"hi, thanks for writing in. the collecting system of the kidney is made of renal calyxes and pelvis. this collects the urine formed in kidney and transports it through the ureter (tubes connecting kidneys and urinary bladder) to the urinary bladder. the pelvicalyceal system is the mouth of the kidney where it connects with the upper end of the ureter. i guess that you have got ultrasound scan done, and it shows mild fullness of the pelvicalyceal system in the left kidney, that is a term applied to increase in diameter of the collecting system in your left kidney. it is not a critical situation, and please do not worry if you do not have any urinary symptoms. since it is mentioned as mild fullness and no kidney stones have been found, therefore(i) it can be that your bladder was completely full at the of ultrasound scan(ii) your kidney pelvicalyceal system is appearing full by itself (extrarenal pelvis) and is an extension of normal appearance.(iii) rarely an infection of urinary system and kidneys (recent or old) can cause such a finding, but this is likely only if you have symptoms like pain in the region of kidney and problems like burning urination or discoloration of urine or any kidney infections in the past.(iv) stones in kidney or ureter can also cause fullness of pelvicalyceal system and since you do not have any stone therefore this does not apply to you. it is important to know if your scan was repeated after passing urine and still there was persistent mild fullness of the pelvicalyceal system on left side. this can also be confirmed by doing an mvp which is injecting a contrast and taking 5 to 6 x-rays to study the functioning of the kidneys in a better way. please consult the urologist."

"please tell what it means to my son , a life if he has . he has upper left or right quadrant pain . he is seeing a doctor where he lives and they are running tests . the doctors have ruled out gallstones so far and found a black sludge in his gallbladder . what does this mean ?",2,77921,"most people who have gallstones do not have symptoms. if you have symptoms, you most likely will have mild pain in the pit of your stomach or in the upper right part of your belly. pain may spread to your right upper back or shoulder blade area. sometimes the pain is more severe. it may be steady, or it may come and go. or it may get worse when you eat. you may decide to go to the doctor because of pain in your belly. in this case, your doctor will ask you questions about when the pain started, where it is, and if it comes and goes or is always there. your doctor may order imaging tests. these take pictures of the inside of your body. an ultrasound of the belly is the best test to find gallstones. this test does not hurt. your ultrasound may not show gallstones. but if your doctor still thinks you have a problem with your gallbladder, he or she may order a gallbladder scan. in this test, a doctor injects dye into a vein in your arm. then a machine takes x-rays as the dye moves through your liver, bile duct, gallbladder, and intestine. if you do not have symptoms, you probably do not need treatment. if your first gallstone attack causes mild pain, your doctor may tell you to take pain medicine and wait to see if the pain goes away. you may never have another attack. waiting to see what happens usually will not cause problems. if you have a bad attack, or if you have a second attack, you may want to have your gallbladder removed. a second attack means you are more likely to have future attacks. many people have their gallbladders removed, and the surgery usually goes well. doctors most often use laparoscopic surgery. for this, your surgeon will make small cuts in your belly and remove your gallbladder. you will probably be able to go back to work or your normal routine in a week or two, but it may take longer for some people. sometimes the surgeon will have to make a larger cut to remove the gallbladder. it will take longer for you to recover from this type of surgery. regards and take care"

i have 4yrs 9 months girl baby . she had rashes and one dermatologist suggested acute 5mg . she is 18 pkg . i am afraid to start the dosage as i read the warning given in the tablets . is there any food restrictions when she take acute ? kindly suggest,3,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"my granddaughter was born 6 was early . it 3lbs 8 of . other had no amniotic fluid . born with an enlarged liver . but liver function level are wnl . spleen was not functioning . has had 2 units of blood , but platelet count is still low . the also had low blood sugar , but it is now wnl also . now dangerous is the spleen not functioning properly . a a an lpn , but a know that preemies are not the same as term babies .",1,100031,"the major concern with this ultrasound is the cirrhotic liver with ascites. when the liver is badly damaged with scarring (cirrhosis), it doesn't work very well. blood flowing through the scarred liver gets backed up and creates high pressure in the liver, which in turn results in fluid leaking in to the abdomen (ascites). unfortunately, cirrhosis with ascites may be an indication that his liver is starting to fail. the kidney shows that a stone is present, but that does not seem to be causing any problems. no other findings are of significance. what needs to be done now is to take a sample of the ascites fluid and determine if it is truly related to the liver cirrhosis or something else. liver disease is the most common cause of ascites, but other conditions may cause it as well, and treatment may differ. further investigation of the liver status may also be needed, such as a biopsy. usually the spleen is enlarged when ascites develops with a cirrhotic liver, and his spleen is normal, so perhaps another more treatable condition is present. liver failure from cirrhosis is the worst case scenario. further evaluation should help define his situation better. hope this helps."

"by day 76 yrs died last week due to lung cancer and in the death summary it was mentioned as advanced carcinoma lung with septicaemia . 2 cycles of chemo was also done . just wanted to know how did the blood infection happen . be was very normal , fit and fine till the last days .",1,10194,"hello and i hope i can help you today. baby aspirin (81 mg dose) is literally an aspirin dose that is safe for child chat doctor. it is commonly prescribed during pregnancy as a mild blood thinner for prevention of different disorders during pregnancy, like recurrent miscarriage, preeclampsia and others. it is very safe and even though it is not recommended to take adult dose aspirin during pregnancy, this dose is safe and also may help the prognosis of your current pregnancy. so you need not worry at all about the medication and its effects on the baby. however, it concerns me that you are being treated with this medication without actually knowing the cause of death of your last child. i do not know if an autopsy was performed on the baby or if you had any tests after the baby died. stillbirth can be caused by a number of factors, some due to maternal clotting disorders, infection, birth defects or complications with the pregnancy itself that may not be helped or prevented by just taking aspirin. in addition, many practitioners would recommend monitoring of your babies heartbeat in the doctor's office on a regular basis (non-stress test) to watch for any signs of distress before the baby is born. so in summary, the aspirin you were prescribed is safe but may not be beneficial to you if the death of your baby was unexplained. tests like screening of your blood for thrombophilia (inherited disorders of blood clotting) and infections (torch liters) really should be done if you haven't done so already to make sure that your aspirin treatment is not the only thing that can be done to help prevent complications with this pregnancy. consultation with a high-risk pregnancy doctor (also called a dermatologist) may be helpful in figuring out if you have a condition that can adversely affect this pregnancy. i hope that this information was helpful and that i was able to answer your question. best wishes for the rest of your pregnancy,"

by 7 year old son has just got in from school and said his willy hurts . a asked him to show me and he can to pull the foreskin back very far and it looks red . there is no pus or anything but he said it is sore when he goes for a wee . be did go swimming today but he said it was of then . have you any ideas or advice please ?,1,104085,"! jacky i really appreciate your efforts for the treatment for your son, and you are not overreacting at all. from what you have said in question i can say from my clinical experience that your son is having some autistic features (as he strictly follows the same routine and throws tantrums when routine is changed). his mood swings might be related to such events as i can guess otherwise he would talk to you normally. you have not mentioned so, but such people are also strict about their dietary habits and may go to extremes patterns to follow it. the point which is against autism is that he developed this pattern just a year back and not from childhood. such features are also seen in a condition called ocd. you have said that he looks depressed, which can be seen in ocd (comorbid depression). you have mentioned mood fluctuations in which one side is that -- he gets angry and yells and screams, but the other side is not reflective of manic features, so, i donor think that he is bipolar. however, making a correct diagnosis the psychiatrist must interview the patient herself. one thing is definite that your son needs help and i'm sure that medicines will help him a lot, more than you may even think of. so, i would suggest that you must make a visit to a psychiatrist with him. when medicine will start showing effect his diet will also improve apart from his behavior, this will help in managing diabetes as well. you have asked if these symptoms are related to diabetes or not. well, i have not gone across any such research work till now where diabetes itself is a cause for such symptoms in any patient. so, it looks unlikely to be so. as you have mentioned that he had a breakup, which can be taken as a stressor, i think it might be related to his current condition to some extent. hope the reply is useful for feel free to ask more questions"

"a have a strong family history of breast cancer ( mother at 47 and aunt at 49 ) . a am 22 years old , and had a biopsy on a spot in my left breast that they removed completely in 2009 . they stated it was a fibroadenoma at the time . in august 2010 a had an ultrasound , and they said that they could no longer see the fibroadenoma . last week a had another ultrasound and the spot is about the same size as it was when it was originally biopsied . they stated it could be a phyllodes tutor , but want me to wait 6 months to have another ultrasound . from what a have read about phyllodes tutors , if this is one , a done want to wait that long . should a see a breast surgeon ?",1,82366,"hello friend, thank you for posting your query through chat doctor. i am a homeopath answering your query and the answer which i am going to give you may contain several thoughts which may appear strange or new for you. this i say because homeopathy is a new system of medicine and is almost unheard by the majority of the population. therefore, due to the high influence of the conventional medicine the people at large are brainwashed to believe and act according to the health education given by them. coming back to the fibroadenoma of your left breast in the year 1979, you had a psychological conflict in the mind level. you are a sensitive individual and that is why your left breast was affected. it must have been related with your child chat doctor. the sensitivity is genetic, and you reacted to the conflict through the brain according to a genetic programming. mind-brain - organ affection resulted in the development of a lump in your left breast in 1979. you consulted your gynecologist, and he suggested that it may turn to become cancerous in future and so it is better to remove it, and you subdued to his suggestion. actually the lump in the breast was an attempt of the body to cure you, or it was the result of a self defense mechanism. since you had not resolved the conflict in the psychological level, the lump remained there without getting resolved. but the body kept the lump protected in a cyst with minimum amount of inflammation called chronic cystitis. by removing the fibroadenoma or chronic cystic mastitis, you were not cured, but your lump in the breast was removed. in 1995 also you are the same person, you are the same sensitive person, and you underwent another more serious psychological conflict and the same left breast was again affected in a more serious manner. instead of recognizing the mass as a defense mechanism, you got the fear in you that you have cancer. the tissue changes also suggested that there is more serious pathology, and they labelled your lump this time as cancer and suggested removal of your left breast. if you could have recognized the lump as a defense mechanism and if you had no fear of cancer, you could have retained your breast. but the fear of cancer is such that it is associated with death and so you lost your breast. in no case, either by removal of lump in 1979 or by removal of your breast in 1995, you are not cured only your disease is cured. hope by this time you have got the answer for your query. both are related to each other because they are in the same individual, same sensitivity, same program. homeopathy cures the person and once the individual is cured all his diseases will be cured. with best wishes,"

"a was on loestrin 24 for 2 years , switched to april due to spotting for a year and a half , and recently restarted the loestrin . a had a normal period the first month on the loestrin , and took the next two packs simultaneously to miss my period for a vacation . after the 3rd pack , my period was very light , much lighter than usual , and much lighter than it was when a was on loestrin the first time . a take my pill at the exact same time every day , by an alarm clock . should a be worried about being pregnant ?",1,83337,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the althea contraceptive contains a combination of estrogen, progesterone and an ingredient that is an anti-an chat doctor. you take the pill every day (at the same time if possible) every day for three weeks of the month. for one week a month, you take no pills, and should have your period start during this time. you should start the pill on the first day of your next period, and it will protect against pregnancy immediately. birth control pills are 99 percent effective in preventing pregnancy, and usually give you a short, light period every 28 days or so. so you finish the three weeks of pills, and then start a new pack exactly 7 days after you finish the old one. the birth control injection, called demo proverb, has only the hormone progesterone in it, so it doesn't have any known benefits for your skin. you get the injection every 3 months and usually the shot causes spotting and irregular bleeding for the first 6 months followed by no periods at all. the shot is nearly 100 percent effective and you don't need to remember to take a tablet every day, but many people dislike the injection due to the bleeding side effects. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful to you. you can also google althea and read the instructions for taking the pill on the pharmaceutical website. best wishes,"

"pm 40 , weigh 85kg and in 5ft 8inches tall . a had a myomectomy a year ago and my periods stabilised , though live been trying to conceive without success.i was given vacate and live been using it for 3 weeks now . what do a need to do to increase my chances of conceiving ?",1,76346,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. fertomid is a type of fertility medication used help to cause ovulation in women who have trouble getting pregnant. because you did get pregnant (even though you had a miscarriage), unless you have been trying since then for over a year and been unable to conceive, the fatimid medication will not likely increase your chance of pregnancy significantly. therefore, even if you forgot to take some pills, you still have a significant chance of pregnancy as you are still very young, especially if you have regular menstrual cycles. if you and your husband have not been trying to conceive for more than a year on your own, i would not recommend using any fertility medication. using fatimid for more than four menstrual cycles can actually reduce your risk of pregnancy, as it decreases the effect of estrogen on your uterine lining. 80% of healthy couples will conceive within one year if they are having regular (at least 2 to 3 days per week) intercourse without contraception. one in 10 pregnancies will end in miscarriage, which means that 90% of the time couples will conceive a perfectly healthy pregnancy after a miscarriage without any form of medical treatment. so in summary, missing the fatimid tablets this particular month will not likely affect your chance of conceiving this cycle if you already ovulate naturally. i strongly recommend trying to get pregnant naturally for one year before using any type of fertility medication, as your body has proven that you can conceive even though that pregnancy did not work out. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this additional information was helpful. best wishes,"

"a am a 42 year old woman with regular periods . we have been trying for 2 years w/o any luck . there are sooooooooooooo many fertility drugs , herds , shots etc .... available . are there any that you would recommend ? a would like of try naturally before any further expensive.sincerely of . trying of have a baby . omaha , neb .",1,76346,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. fertomid is a type of fertility medication used help to cause ovulation in women who have trouble getting pregnant. because you did get pregnant (even though you had a miscarriage), unless you have been trying since then for over a year and been unable to conceive, the fatimid medication will not likely increase your chance of pregnancy significantly. therefore, even if you forgot to take some pills, you still have a significant chance of pregnancy as you are still very young, especially if you have regular menstrual cycles. if you and your husband have not been trying to conceive for more than a year on your own, i would not recommend using any fertility medication. using fatimid for more than four menstrual cycles can actually reduce your risk of pregnancy, as it decreases the effect of estrogen on your uterine lining. 80% of healthy couples will conceive within one year if they are having regular (at least 2 to 3 days per week) intercourse without contraception. one in 10 pregnancies will end in miscarriage, which means that 90% of the time couples will conceive a perfectly healthy pregnancy after a miscarriage without any form of medical treatment. so in summary, missing the fatimid tablets this particular month will not likely affect your chance of conceiving this cycle if you already ovulate naturally. i strongly recommend trying to get pregnant naturally for one year before using any type of fertility medication, as your body has proven that you can conceive even though that pregnancy did not work out. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this additional information was helpful. best wishes,"

"i a had my period 2 weeks ago everything was fine but a have had unprotected sex in the last week & now a a bleeding again it a light bleeding & kind of pinkish . would a be pregnant or are there any other causes , a a 22 years old & after my last unprotected sex a was worried so a took 2 birth control tablets a am waiting to start the pill until my next regular cycle .",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

i my name is sarah and i have a question the back of my mouth started hurting and i could barley open it and i went to the hospital and they said it look like there was tissue building up around my wisdom teeth and they gave me penicillin and some pain medication and today it feels better but i looked at it and there is a hole in the back of my gum ? ? ? id if its because its healing or getting worst ? ? ?,1,31396,"hi. thanks for the query. as there was stinky white stuff from a hole in the gum in the very back region of mouth, then it is most probably due to the hole from which wisdom tooth is about to erupt. many a time if the wisdom tooth is impacted the hole or opening is formed in the gum, but the tooth does not erupt and there is food lodgment in that area. so my suggestion is to consult a dentist if there is any problem and get an x-ray of the area done. if the wisdom tooth is impacted and if there is any problem repeatedly like infection and bad smell you can get the tooth extracted. as of now always gargle after meals and do not let food accumulate in that area. hope this helps. regards."

(considering your period of 30 days). so the ovulation day falls on 8 feb. thus the fertile period would be from 3 february till 11 feb. if your period is different from 30 days, please add or subtract those many days in this calculation. according to your calculation, the fertile period starts on 2 feb. so the chances of pregnancy due to intercourse on 31 jan. are remote, though cannot be completely excluded, since variation by couple of days has to be expected. it is too close to the fertile period. though there was no ejaculation, you cannot exclude pre-ejaculation fluid passage which happens unknowingly. it does contain some sperms which are capable of fertilizing an ovum. so though the maximum chances of conception are due to sex on 2 feb., for legal purpose, you may opt for dna test to ascertain the paternity. i hope this helps you."

"a am a 34 or old male and a have been experiencing pain where the thigh connects to the hip , between my side and my groin . a think in the past someone had mentioned my hip flexor ? a don to remember doing anything to strain it and been feeling the pain for about 6 months , just now starting to become uncomfortable . an a try any home treatment or should a consult my physician ?",1,44020,"i'm sorry to hear about your pain and how it is affecting you physical activity. now hip pain can be tricky. many times patients feel they have hip pain when actually the pain is from the sacroiliac joint. to differentiate, first imagine where you would point to if someone asked you where the most pain occurs. if the pain is in the groin and worsened with walking, climbing stairs, getting in and out of the car or a seat, it is likely hip joint pain. if the pain is actually out to the side and above your buttocks (picture someone placing their hands on their ""hips""), it is likely sacroiliac joint pain. many times patients with sacroiliac joint pain can have symptoms radiate down the leg, while hip pain typically radiates into the groin and sometimes to the same sided knee. the best way to figure the problem out is to have a x-ray of your hip and also of your low back and sacroiliac joint. i hope this answer is helpful. in either case, the good news is that stretching, anti-inflammatory medications and even a joint injection can be very helpful. i hope you feel better and get out golfing again soon!"

"by 2 year old was playing in a friends house and saw her eating something , when a took it out of vermouth realised it was a tablet . checked the pack and its a neuron 200mg tablet.there are 3 missing from pack but friend thinks shes had a couple . little one seems fine but done know if shes swallowed one or not and should a be worried ?",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

that could a red help about the size of a quarter that appears in elbow and then it goes away in about a week and then comes back and it does to hurt if you touch it but it feels weird and sometimes itches and when it goes away there is still a little spot like a scar,1,77921,"most people who have gallstones do not have symptoms. if you have symptoms, you most likely will have mild pain in the pit of your stomach or in the upper right part of your belly. pain may spread to your right upper back or shoulder blade area. sometimes the pain is more severe. it may be steady, or it may come and go. or it may get worse when you eat. you may decide to go to the doctor because of pain in your belly. in this case, your doctor will ask you questions about when the pain started, where it is, and if it comes and goes or is always there. your doctor may order imaging tests. these take pictures of the inside of your body. an ultrasound of the belly is the best test to find gallstones. this test does not hurt. your ultrasound may not show gallstones. but if your doctor still thinks you have a problem with your gallbladder, he or she may order a gallbladder scan. in this test, a doctor injects dye into a vein in your arm. then a machine takes x-rays as the dye moves through your liver, bile duct, gallbladder, and intestine. if you do not have symptoms, you probably do not need treatment. if your first gallstone attack causes mild pain, your doctor may tell you to take pain medicine and wait to see if the pain goes away. you may never have another attack. waiting to see what happens usually will not cause problems. if you have a bad attack, or if you have a second attack, you may want to have your gallbladder removed. a second attack means you are more likely to have future attacks. many people have their gallbladders removed, and the surgery usually goes well. doctors most often use laparoscopic surgery. for this, your surgeon will make small cuts in your belly and remove your gallbladder. you will probably be able to go back to work or your normal routine in a week or two, but it may take longer for some people. sometimes the surgeon will have to make a larger cut to remove the gallbladder. it will take longer for you to recover from this type of surgery. regards and take care"

i or a have acne last 5 year but a take dermatologist treatment and acne problem solve but in between sometime this problem occur and leaves a scars on skin and now a day again same acne again prevent on face and its a red spots that are inner side the skin hard type and also pain after few day its made white pimple then leave it spot on skin a a so worried about it coz already have scars on skin,1,78259,"hello rama, welcome to chat doctor forum. it is very common to get pimples (acne)at this age due to the hormonal changes taking place in your body with puberty. they do subside as age advances.however, it is advisable to get it treated if you are getting pustules or nodular acne which leave behind hyperpigmented scars on the face causing the face to appear dark. so a consultation with a dermatologist would be beneficial if you really suffer from bad acne scars.meanwhile, here are some tips to help prevent breakouts and clear them up as fast as possible: 1. wash your face twice a day with warm water and a mild soap. gently massage your face. don't scrub. overwashing and scrubbing can cause skin to become irritated. 2.don't pop pimples. its tempting, but you shouldn't: popping pimples can push infected material further into the skin, leading to more swelling and redness, and even scarring. 3. avoid touching your face with your fingers or leaning your face on objects that collect sebum and skin residue like your phone. touching your face can spread the bacteria that cause pores to become inflamed and irritated. to keep bacteria at bay, wash your hands before applying anything to your face, such as treatment creams or makeup.4. keep hair clean and out of your face to prevent additional dirt and oil from clogging your pores.5. protect your skin from the sun. it may seem like a tan masks acne, but its only temporary. a tan may worsen your acne, not improve it. tanning also causes damage to skin .6. avoid over the counter acne creams as each skin type is different and creams prescribed by doctor after examining your skin are preferable. you may apply natural aloe vera gel for better results. regards"

(regular use of emergency pill is harmful)conception occurs if she was in 10th to 18th day of her cycle(in a regular cycle of 28 day duration). you can ask her at what day she is in and wait for next cycle to occur. if it delayed by 7 days then get done upt to diagnose if pregnant and then the required treatment can be taken. regards"
"hi my fiancee is currently 26 weeks pregnant and has had a tooth removed today , she is suffering from a large amount of pain , is there anything she can take safely to ease the pain ? ?",3,42968,"basically your mother is suffering from breast cancer which has been operated upon, and she is a known patient of heart disease for which she has been scented. the biopsy shows that at least one node has tumor. ideally in such a situation i would recommend chemotherapy to her. but that she can't take safely due to her heart condition. what i would like to know before i can comment upon her survival is the size of the tumor that was removed and whether it has spread to other parts of the body (on chest x-ray, ultrasound abdomen, bone scan). if it's an early tumor (less than 5 cm in size, not spread), then the chances of her being cured just with surgery are nearly 80%. we can further improve these chances by knowing her receptor status. this test can be done on the tumor that has already been removed and is called er (estrogen receptor) and pr (progesterone receptor). if any of these are positive then she can be placed on a tablet for 5 years. this tablet will not affect her heart and decrease the chances of disease recurrence by almost 33%."

a had nexplanon put in july 9 and had constant red and brown spotting so a had it removed on september 23 but the spotting still has to stopped and a be went through a month of birth control pills since ! why is this happening to me and how can a stop it ?,1,27194,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. tri-sprintec is a birth control pill that has a traffic regimen; which means that each color pill in the package has a slightly different dose of hormones. occasionally, women who take traffic pills may have some spotting in the first few days after each pill strength changes over the course of the month. this may cause some slight bleeding or spotting when were not supposed to have your period. whenever you had vaginal bleeding, regardless of the cause, usually there is some cramping that accompanies it. furthermore, it is not unusual to have irregular bleeding or spotting in the first 3 months of pill use. both sprinter and tri-sprintec are considered low-dose birth control pills, however there are many brands on the market that have a lower dose of estrogen than the pill you are currently taking. so you may have less irregular bleeding and spotting on a different kind of monophasic (same dose all month) birth control pill. regarding pregnancy, the chance of your conceiving while taking birth control pills and using a condom is basically nonexistent. so i believe the symptoms you were experiencing are side effects due to the new birth control pill. if your desire is for lighter, regular periods, a different brand of monophasic pill may work better for you with fewer side effects. i hope i was able to adequately answer questions today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

(the amount of platelets in the bloodstream is reduced because the spleen is busy trapping them). so usually people with cirrhosis end up having a problem with portal hypertension and an enlarged spleen, and a reduced platelet count in the bloodstream. as time goes by, the liver may try to repair itself by growing new cells. if there is a lot of scar tissue already present the new cells grow between scar tissue (and result in abnormal nodules). the nodules and scar tissue further interfere with blood flow through the liver. so over time people with advanced cirrhosis can end up having a problem with more and more abnormal nodules and scar tissue forming which interferes even more with blood flow through the liver which makes the spleen continue to enlarge, and the platelet count continue to chat doctor. the splenomegaly is usually not reversible. please go for regular medical follow up. hope this helps"

hi i have started taking akt3 from 9th dec it is just three days a at the same time i a trying to conceive will there be any problem in getting pregnant .. actually coz of to my end is very thin so will it become thicker after taking the treatment of to .. ? ?,1,108096,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. it is true that theoretically you should have been clear of the injection within three months of discontinuation, however many women after being a depo-provera for a long time do not resume having ovulatory, regular, menstrual cycles until 6 to 9 months or even up to a year after discontinuation. unfortunately, it is difficult to artificially induce ovulation in women who are coming off depo-provera. if you were not trying to become pregnant, your cycle could be regulated temporarily with birth control pills, but if you're actually trying to get pregnant the best thing you can do with this point is to just keep trying and wait and see. if you feel any symptoms of pregnancy, and you haven't gotten your period for a while, i would do pregnancy test just to make sure. there is always a possibility even if your periods are not regular that you do ovulate sometimes. so in summary, continue having unprotected sex every other to every three days and give it some more time. 80% of couples will conceive within one year, and if after a year of trying you and your partner are unsuccessful, it might be a good idea to see a fertility specialist for an evaluation. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes, and good luck getting pregnant,"
