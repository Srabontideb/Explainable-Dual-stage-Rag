"a am undergoing testing for breast cancer . in 01-27-14 the doctor removed my nipple , areola and some tissue under the skin . the results showed cancer . another surgery on 03-10-14 resulted in removal of lymph nodes and a lumpectomy and removal of additional tissue . the surgeon thinks it is early stage 2 . a saw an oncologist today , and we are planning a pet-scan . the said a have globular breast cancer . a also discovered a small lump on my left breast , and 2 different colleagues concurred that there was a lump . depending on the outcome , maybe mastectomies on bone breasts followed by chemotherapy . a lot to take in one sitting .",1,82366,"hello friend, thank you for posting your query through chat doctor. i am a homeopath answering your query and the answer which i am going to give you may contain several thoughts which may appear strange or new for you. this i say because homeopathy is a new system of medicine and is almost unheard by the majority of the population. therefore, due to the high influence of the conventional medicine the people at large are brainwashed to believe and act according to the health education given by them. coming back to the fibroadenoma of your left breast in the year 1979, you had a psychological conflict in the mind level. you are a sensitive individual and that is why your left breast was affected. it must have been related with your child chat doctor. the sensitivity is genetic, and you reacted to the conflict through the brain according to a genetic programming. mind-brain - organ affection resulted in the development of a lump in your left breast in 1979. you consulted your gynecologist, and he suggested that it may turn to become cancerous in future and so it is better to remove it, and you subdued to his suggestion. actually the lump in the breast was an attempt of the body to cure you, or it was the result of a self defense mechanism. since you had not resolved the conflict in the psychological level, the lump remained there without getting resolved. but the body kept the lump protected in a cyst with minimum amount of inflammation called chronic cystitis. by removing the fibroadenoma or chronic cystic mastitis, you were not cured, but your lump in the breast was removed. in 1995 also you are the same person, you are the same sensitive person, and you underwent another more serious psychological conflict and the same left breast was again affected in a more serious manner. instead of recognizing the mass as a defense mechanism, you got the fear in you that you have cancer. the tissue changes also suggested that there is more serious pathology, and they labelled your lump this time as cancer and suggested removal of your left breast. if you could have recognized the lump as a defense mechanism and if you had no fear of cancer, you could have retained your breast. but the fear of cancer is such that it is associated with death and so you lost your breast. in no case, either by removal of lump in 1979 or by removal of your breast in 1995, you are not cured only your disease is cured. hope by this time you have got the answer for your query. both are related to each other because they are in the same individual, same sensitivity, same program. homeopathy cures the person and once the individual is cured all his diseases will be cured. with best wishes,"

"hello , a was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2002 and was on avonex to treat it for many years . about 2 years ago a came off of the avonex and haven to started anything since . two weeks ago a started to feel some numbness and tingling on the tip of my tongue and just the other day it spread to my lower lip and now my chin . to you think this is all related to my of ? thank you for your help ! michele",1,44715,"hello, i can understand your concern. it would have been helpful if you had mentioned which tooth was treated for root canal. as you are mentioning that the tooth was black and had cracks in it, i am assuming that the tooth is in the lower front region, and you had had some trauma to the lower jaw area which made the tooth dead and also hurt the chin and lip. other possibility is that if the tooth was dead for many years, it may have developed a periapical cyst in relation with the tooth which might be pressing on the mental nerve supplying lower lip and chin and may cause numbness of those areas. alternatively, the numbness may have started after taking local anesthesia in the lower front area for some tooth problem and the injection might have been given deep. in any case, it seems that the nerve supplying sensation to the lower front area of jaw along with lower lip and chin (mental nerve) is damaged. usually, if the nerve is damaged, it can regenerate in 3-6 months and the sensations can return. if you are not sure regarding the crown on the tooth, you can avoid it for some months and take care not to bite hard things with that tooth so that it does not fracture. you can get the crown after the numbness is solved. i would also advise you to visit an oral and maxillofacial surgeon for the examination of the area and regarding numbness. he/she might take an x-ray to rule out presence of periapical lesion or cyst in relation with the tooth. crown should surely be postponed until this possibility is ruled out. i hope this information helps you. thank you for choosing chat doctor. i wish you feel better soon. best,"

"by brother has been diamond with tutor in the femur bone two years back , had surgery and tutor removed.during that time doctor told him if at all it occurs again it will be at same place.but recently he had severe pain and after the bone san its revealed that he has tutors in other places.we are worried about the type of tutor .so kindly advice",1,43960,"hi, thanks for writing in. your situation needs a more professional approach than taking out all the hardware inserted during surgery and replacing it with cadaver bone. the bone we have within us is a living tissue though it is hard and stronger than other tissues. this is because of calcium deposition and there is regular exchange of minerals between the bone and other tissues. the bone also gets its blood supply and remains alive. therefore, please do not consider cadaver bone replacement for yourself. the problem with two cages and its displacement at operated site requires proper management. back fusion surgeries might not provide a good level of pain relief in some patients. though the pressure on nerve roots at strategic locations seems to be relieved by doing surgical procedure, the patient might often complain severe lower back pain even after surgery. this happens in about 20 to 40 percent of patients and the reason is that the affected nerve roots are still under pressure in areas other than where surgical manipulation has been done. if laser is not an option for you then please discuss new methods like radiofrequency ablation and how effective it will work for you. the problem for your extended suffering was the infection that unfortunately developed in the operated site. now that it is cured, healing should occur fast. wishing you the best for hip surgery."

hi my is ashley in a 21 year old female i have just had a baby 4 months ago and a am exclusively breast feeding and have the i.u.d birth control i had unprotected sex two day before getting it inserted but used the pull out method as a form of birth control live had my i.u.d in now for about three months and a half i have not had a central cycle so far and in am starting to feel dizzy and nauseous with a fluttering feeling in my stomach every couple of days mostly at night could these systems be a side effect from the i.u.d . ?,1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"hello , my husband finished chemo for bladder cancer ( stage 2 ) and was told he need to have his bladder removed . be can to have radiation because of artificial hips . apparently it would not work because of the titanium in joins . is that the only possible solution to have bladder removed even though his symptoms of any cancer are no longer present . to bleeding at all .",1,48341,"hi, thanks for writing in. sorry to hear about your husband who is having advanced stage gall bladder cancer. this cancer is difficult to treat and doing surgery extends survival. since there is spread to liver therefore he is having stage 4 cancer. doctors might have suggested chemotherapy to stabilize the disease progress and control it. however, since he has refused chemotherapy, it is possible that his disease has progressed in uncontrolled way and spread to the liver. the expected survival in case of stage 4 gall bladder cancer is 2 years with good cae and recommended treatment. since chemotherapy was not given therefore the survival in your husband might be reduced from 6 months to a year. he must be under a lot of physical pain and please discuss with pain relief doctor and make him comfortable. please do not worry."

hey . in a pharmacist . in on toyama and have tried to stop taking it several times . it makes me lose weight and inhibits my though process . i started it for migraines . now i have seizures . not a pretty thing . the last one was new years eve in a grocery store . will kappa work ? don to care about the migraines anymore . just fix the seizures but let me work .,1,90927,"hi, i am chat doctor. i have read your message. i think i can help you. first, the symptoms that you have described are highly suggestive of seizures. here is why- 1. they come in night-seizures are commonly triggered when the patient sleeps or just around the sleep. of course, they can occur at other times too.2. they start from the leg and move up and then spread to the rest of the body.3. the episodes last 3-4 minutes and then resolves. i assume (you have not mentioned it) that it is never remembered by him, the episode that is. i think you should both take it very seriously. there is a high possibility that there is an intracranial problem that he is having which is extending and progressing undetected in the brain just because you do not want to visit a neurologist. i think you should meet a neurologist as soon as possible and request an mri brain (with spectroscopy if needed) and video eeg. if he does turn out to have a pathology, treatment will have to be initiated for the pathology in addition to regular anti-epileptic medicines. i suggest taking a video of these episodes that he is having. it may help convince him that he needs to visit a doctor, and it may be helpful to the doctor in seeing the condition that your husband has. yes, you need to visit a neurologist as soon as possible. ideally, i would also like to know if he has been having headaches for the past years? does he seem to be having episodes where he does not recollect what he has been doing for a certain duration of time? you may need to talk to his colleagues at work and find out if he has been having seizures or any abnormal behavior at work. there is a high chance that he knows that he has been having seizures at work and not telling you about it. i have tried my best to help you. unfortunately, i cannot initiate / suggest medicines as long as the diagnosis is not confirmed because the anti-epileptics may have severe side effects. best of luck,"

i a be been experiencing pain in my knee for three years now it has spread into both my hips and all trough my legs making everything painful a be been to many doctors and they all say the same nothings wrong so a was wondering if a all had any advice or if there was any tests a can ask to have performed a be had rays and an mri on my left knee is there anything else a need relief a want my life back,1,91001,"hi, thank you for providing the brief history of you. a thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised. as mentioned you had undergone the tkr almost a year back, did you perform any physical exercises to get the optimum results of the post tkr? usually all joint replacement surgeries are successful, but the post tkr rehabilitation is not followed properly and later stages there are issues. also, since you mentioned you have pain in the calf muscle, and you cannot apply weight, first thing to do is to take an x-ray of knee and see if the prosthesis is intact. as in 99% of cases they are intact. performing clinical test like - slr will help guide further. as you already have a tkr, there will be a change in the gait mechanism and the abnormality in the spine due to abnormal weight-bearing on either side. like if you had tkr on right then the left has more load and vice versa. now tkr was performed due to pain in knee joint due to osteoarthritis and reduced joint space. so it can be possible you have the oa knee from at least 5 years ? these 5 years have changes the biomechanics of the weight-bearing joints and may be tilting of the pelvic. now to not go much deeper into the technical aspect of the situation, i will advise you to take an mri of the lumbar spine to see any soft tissue abnormality. if the test comes positive the treatment will be guided for the same - rest, medication and physical therapy. so mention little brief here - that there is change in the anatomy of the spine due to oa knee and the symptoms arise before or after surgery. this is my personal clinical experience with patients. so when tkr is performed in our clinical practice we strengthen not only the muscles of the knee but also the core, spine, pelvic floor and whole lower limbs on each side. as we believe in our clinic that body functions as a single unit and disturbance in the unit may lead to symptoms at later stages. our tkr cases in clinical setting are 100% success without any aches and pains for years. i recommend you to undergo an mri of the lumbar spine and undergo physical therapy later. i am sure you will be 100% fit and back to life. regardsjay in chat doctor."

"a had unprotected sex 2 months ago . a took the morning after plan a pill . the problem is that a am on birth control - odessa - so a only have my period like every 3 months in a given year so a cant tell if a missed a period . 2 weeks before a did it , a haunt been taking the birth control regularly but a have been . a took 2 pregnancy tests with the first response . one was a month ago and the other digital one a took a week ago and both were negative . a know because a am on birth control the hormones might be screwed up though and screw up the test . is there any way a can know for sure ? of not , a intend to visit the doctor around dec. 20th or so .",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

an diuretics cause sweating ? a have polycyclic kidney disease stage 3 and flirting with congestive heart failure . a have rash from kidney problem unless a take the prescribed diuretic + potassium supplement . a seem to be between a rock and a hard placeyyyy @ yyyy,3,31373,"hello. welcome to chat doctor, and thank you for your question. i carefully read your query. supplemental oxygen always helps in congestive heart failure patients. some of these patients need it with higher percentages of ejection fraction and some with lower. a congestive heart failure patient with a 20% function of the left ventricle is advised to be confined only to every-day duties and not various strains of a healthy heart or a slightly decreased heart function. a 20% functioning heart means that 80% of its content remains in the left ventricle (normal being 30-45%) in every cardiac cycle. this means that blood coming from the pulmonary circulation does not have space to empty, and all of this is interpreted as a raised pressure in this circulation. this produces fluid build up in lungs and difficulty to breath (dyspnea). therefore, the lower the heart function percentage, the higher and the more often the need for supplemental oxygen. besides oxygen, a good support to lowering the above-mentioned pulmonary circulation high pressure, are the diuretics, and in these figures, i would recommend a loop diuretic and a potassium-sparing diuretic to her therapy. no salt should be used in her diet, whatsoever, because it retains the water and further raises the pulmonary pressure. i hope i was helpful with my answer. take care. best regards,"

"i , may a answer your health queries right now ? please type your query here ... a have been sick to my stomach overnight for the last 3 weeks and today for the first time pm sick in the morning . also accompanied by a headache . there is no way a can be pregnant cause we use condoms and a have also had a pap smear and 2 years ago a colon copy and at the same time a endoscopy . all they found was that a may have ibs . that could these symptoms possibly be ?",1,33341,"hi, if you came to my clinic with those complaints i would ask you to stop worrying. many women that start using the pills for the first time experience similar problems. i understand that you have taken the inactive pills first and then started on the active pills. also, you have had intercourse only after your period was over that is about 11 days ago. the chances of pregnancy occurring after a single act of unprotected sexual intercourse are only 4%. also, for women that have regular periods the chance of getting pregnant is more if intercourse occurs after 11-12 days since the first day of the period. hence, the chances of getting pregnant are low if you have had contact before this period. you are also having a sick feeling in the stomach and most probably a cramp like feeling. this may be due to the pills as some females take time to get adjusted and may improve with continuous use and by taking the pills with food. the pills are not known to cause any major effect on the baby if they are inadvertently taken in early pregnancy. since you have started taking the active pills late, i would recommend that you use a backup contraceptive measure like condoms, for the next 7 days while you still take the pills to avoid pregnancy. i would be pleased to answer any further queries that you may have, enjoy a wonderful day."

"the other morning my 5 year old daughter woke up with a rather large `` white headed '' pimple on her forehead , as the day went on and today , she has a few more ..... i was putting an oily senate cream in those areas for her dry skin .. could that have clogged her pores and caused this ? any help would be appreciated .",1,14711,"hello. thank you for asking at chat doctor. i went through your daughters' history. i would like to know more about your daughter like - how frequently does she have nose symptoms (running nose, nasal congestion, sneezing)? how frequently dose she has wheezing/difficulty in breathing? does she always have fever with symptoms or sometimes symptoms can be present without fever? which are the worst seasons for her or does she have symptoms throughout the year? does she have any other allergies? does she have anyone in family with allergies/asthma? above details would help to decide whether she may have childhood asthma. diagnosis of childhood asthma is difficult up to age of 5-6 years. from your given history, i would like to make suggestions for your daughter as follows:1. were i treating her, i would suggest her montelukast and levocetirizine/cetirizine on regular basis, which may reduce her symptoms.2. whenever she has wheezing/breathing difficulty, i would suggest her to use albuterol/levosalbutamol inhaler on as-and-when-needed basis. metered dose inhaler with spacer with mask would be the best inhaler device for her in my opinion.3. i would also suggest her a healthy diet rich in vitamins & minerals (adequate amounts of green leafy vegetables, fruits, sprouts, etc.) which will improve her immunity and will be helpful in a longer run.4. personally i would suggest her allergy testing which will help you to identify the substances causing troubles to her and also to know the measures to avoid them.5. were i treating her, i would prescribe her vitamin c for 2-3 months which may reduce frequency of colds.6. please try to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes & air pollution as much as possible. hope above suggestions will be helpful to her. should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at chat doctor. wish your daughter the best of the health. thank you & regards."

"for the past 3 weeks ever since i felt sick in school one day i have had the nervous feeling constantly and it would feel like i have a lump in my throat and feel like in going to throw up , which would cause me not to eat because it would feel like i was on a gag or throw up . a feel like i keep worrying that in going to feel like this the next day and the next day and that it wont go away , also i get more afraid before i eat because i a worried i a on a get that throw up feeling in my throat . a have dry heaved and threw up from this a couple of times but not this week . this feeling goes away a bit on the week ends but is the worst on mondays . now can i stop this ?",1,77258,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the sensation of feeling something stuck in your throat is a symptom of reflux-when the food that you eat or the acid in your stomach can back up and irritate it. this is common when you have a large belly at full term because your stomach is being pushed up towards your chest and also the hormones from the pregnancy cause the top opening of your stomach that connects to your esophagus to be looser, so food and acid can leak more easily. the best way to try to control this is to eat only small amounts at one time and to make sure you sit up for at least 2 hours after meals. taking antacids, which for the most part are all safe during pregnancy, can also help. trying to cough up what you feel in your throat will not help because there is not actually something solid coming up. these symptoms may be difficult to treat, but the good news is the symptoms will get better after you have the baby. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

i may i know why veranda operation is done ? hats the main cause of it ? that they all do ?,2,62052,"hello, how are you? stones in the gall bladder are a fairly common finding during ultrasound of the abdomen. you do not need any additional tests to confirm the presence of gall stones. but not all gall stones need treatment. in most cases, the stones do not cause any symptoms to the patient. it is especially true if there is a single stone. in some cases, when there is a small stone, it can spontaneously get expelled from the gall bladder. it is usually accompanied by pain and occasionally jaundice. the main danger of gall stones is when the stone blocks any of the ducts (tubes) chat doctor. the stone can get stuck at the opening of the gall bladder (cystic duct) or in the main bile duct (especially at the lower end where it is joined by the pancreatic duct, and together they open into the intestine). it causes bile to back up and will cause pain in the abdomen and vomiting, fever and jaundice. this scenario is more common when the stone is small enough to pass through the gall bladder opening, but for some reason gets stuck in the bile duct. it will need an ercp to extract the stone. it is much more common when the gall bladder has multiple small stones. in 99% of the cases, the treatment is accomplished by laparoscopic cholecystectomy (removal of gall bladder by making three small cuts on the abdomen, guiding the surgery through a small camera inserted). it is a fairly routine surgery and could be done at most hospitals safely. unfortunately, there are no medical therapies available once the stones have already formed. in your wives case, there are multiple small stones. since you are apprehensive about surgery, i could suggest a wait and watch policy with a very low threshold for operation, meaning i would get the gall bladder removed at the earliest and the mildest of symptoms. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

hi there .. i am a 49 or old female with history of diverticulitis and hemmoroids and bleeding as well as chronic anaemia .. i have asked my dr. to request a colonoscopy ... i am wondering if in your opinion this would warrant an `` urgent '' requisition ... at least 80-90 % of my bowel movements result in bleeding and hemmorhoids ...,1,90247,"hello,erinlynn0730,you mention having difficulty with bowel movements periodically. if you are constipated and have hard stool and strain during defication.it is possible to have hemorrhoids or fissure from which you can bleed. with fissure or tear in the lining of the very end of rectum, you get severe burning sensation. if you have internal hemorrhoids, they can prolapse or protrude after straining, and you could feel a lump. if you don't have these and are having bright red blood, you need to see a colorectal surgeon or a gastroenterologist to have endoscopy, either sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy to rule out ulcerative colitis or bleeding polyps. if you have a family history of colon cancer, you need to have colonoscopy for sure. the other problem associated with right lower abdominal pain and bleeding is acute diverticulitis or bleeding from diverticulosis, pockets from the colon due to infection. usually there may be fever, chills, bloody diarrhea and rightsized abdominal pain. hope this gives you some idea for what to discuss with your own doctor. i wish you well."

"i , by had has to undergo kidney dialysis . is there any risk ? that is the life expectancy after that ? does he need this dialysis on a continue basis ? thanks",1,40579,"hello and welcome to chat doctor. as a urologist and transplant surgeon, i can understand your anxiety. your nephew has kidney failure with h.t.and now on maintained dialysis. he needs to undergo a kidney transplantation or continue with dialysis. as his kidneys have failed, till a transplant is done, a dialysis is only option. the kidney function is reflected in the creatinine level, so it's done regularly. if his dialysis is reduced to twice-weekly, his general condition will worsen. if you've any doubts, send all the reports to me, as a direct question. chat doctor. manga."
"i , by had has to undergo kidney dialysis . is there any risk ? that is the life expectancy after that ? does he need this dialysis on a continue basis ? thanks",2,107643,"hi, kidney disease is broadly classified as two types. acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease. in aka, the chances of long term dialysis is less and patient recovers with time with normal kidney function. but in ckd, patient is on regular hemodialysis for long time or frankly say for lifetime. in that condition, we should consider kidney transplant. because dialysis is not a cure, it only prolongs the life expectancy along with some patient well-being. so for permanent cure, you have to think about kidney transplant. but kidney transplant is not so easy process. before it a battery of investigations are done to find out how is the risk benefit ratio. if all important factors are favorable then we proceed for transplant. in your case, one major risk is heart so first cardiologist asses the heart function, and then he will tell you about how risky is this process?there is no specific criteria for creatinine level for transplant. if creatinine level is stable without dialysis and patient has no symptoms then better you can wait for transplant. but if he needs regular dialysis to control creatinine level then better you think for transplant. heart failure patient can be taken for transplant if he has good ejection fraction. so you can go for kidney transplant if he has ckd with good ejection fraction of heart. thank you"

"i , a am at work and taking a break . a am looking for a doctor that can help me with my daughter . a believe my daughter has a very bad odd behavior . the is my fourth child and a know the difference of the behavior . the is 12 years old . her behavorial is not getting any better . the is always angry , sad , depressed , clumsy . when a talk to her , its as a am a bother to her . the done want to be with the family.she does not communicate with the family and she blames everyone but herself . the is not a mean child but she is not lovable at all .",1,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"hello in 22 years old , weigh 68kg and in 1.58m , experience painful sudden acceleration of heart beat and i started experiencing this burning sensation when urinating and even after that i always felt like i needed to urinate but i started using gina guard and i didst feel anything until i stopped using it , i am sexually active so it might be an infection because the intimate wash product could have just been suppressing it and i sometimes have this dry brown discharge which looks like the things after a menstrual cycle but in usually not on my periods at that time ... so any ideas ?",1,25338,"hello and thank you for using chat doctor. i carefully read your question and understand your concern. but you should not worry, its nothing serious. as you describe, my opinion is that it might be a rhythm issue. someone can feel strong and fast heart beats for different reasons. it may be a simple sinus tachycardia. this means that the heart is beating faster than 100 beats for minute. its normal range in a resting condition is between 60-100 beats for minute. when it goes up you may feel a strong heart beat in your chest and a sensation like your body is beating too. another reason for this sensation might be what we call an ekstrasystol.these is electrical heart impulses that generates in some parts of heart different from normal sinus rhythm. this generates an escaped beat that the person feels like jumping ore bumping. it gives the sensation like a beat is skipping, may experience palpitations or an anxiety sensation that your daughter explains like trembling. this extrasistoles may happen from different reasons from simple emotional stress to other pathologies like anemia, hyperthyroidism etc. so, my opinion as cardiologist is that you have nothing to worry. it is just a simple episode, and it is quite normal in younger ages. only if these symptoms persist and begins to interfere the daily live, if i was your treating doctor i will recommend some examinations like a blood analysis to exclude anemia, the thyroid hormones, an electrocardiogram, echocardiography and of course a holder monitoring. this will help us to document and see what happens with heart rhythm. at meantime, i will recommend your daughter to avoid coffee, caffeine products because they rise heart frequency and extrasistolic beats. i encourage her to have physical training because sometimes it helps in reducing extrasistoles, tachycardia, even making them disappear. wish i was helpful. take good care. best regards"

a a suffering from a severe gout attacker 30 days in both feet a have been drinking black cherry and drinking alkaline water while watching purine intake . could this be related to kidney problems or my diagnosed reflex sympathetic dystrophy in my knees ?,1,22490,"hi, gout is a disease of high uric acid content in blood that is due to increased purine intake as you have rightly understood, and decreased elimination by kidneys. there is a certain amount of uric acid that your kidneys can handle, if your intake of purine containing foods is more than what your kidneys can handle, the extra uric acid remains in the blood and gets deposited in various parts of the body, like skin and joints. this is what has happened in your case. in fact extra uric acid even stagnates in kidneys causing stones. to that extent, yes it is a kidney problem. however, it has no relation to sympathetic dystrophy. regards"

hey i had several bloodclots in my left upper arm after 9 months they took me off warfarin at the time the clots were gone i was off warfarin 30 days and they come back now i think there gone again i have been on blood thinner for 2 years they say my blood is of this week it is 2.7 but my arm is killing me can you still get clots if your blood is that thin ? a,1,16236,"hi, this is chat doctor. welcome. the condition you are telling is a serious thing. if there are clots inside your heart & they are moving than you should be alarmed. these clots can go to brain (as you said they have already gone), lung-causing pulmonary embolism which is also a serious condition. they can go to extremities like hands & legs and can cause gangrene. we generally give blood thinner to such patients which helps in keeping the blood thin & thus decrease embolism. these blood thinner should continue life long. you will also need a trans esophageal echo(tee) to know exactly the size of hole & whether it could be closed. so please make an appointment with your cardiologist soon for further management. if you want any further help, i'll be happy to assist you. thanks"

"hello . a have a burning in my chest , up my left side of neck and my left arm feels funny .. my hand tingling . in tuesday a went to the of for severe chest pain in heart ( that is what it felt like ) . it was to crushing but it was in heart and down arm , a was nauseated and very anxious . ekg was normal don to know what blood results were . a a 43 with elias as well . a a scared now . nobody seems to take this seriously . thank you .",1,28983,"hello. thank you for your question and welcome to chat doctor. i carefully read your query. first, i believe that you know what does a chest pain originated from coronary arteries feel like. this is called angina, and is more like a severe heaviness or tightness in the mid-chest and which spreads to the left arm. sharp pain with the highest probability does not reflect a pain originated from a blockage in the coronary arteries. on the stent side, since it has been seven years you underwent stent implantation, i assume that the stents are patent and working well, since the highest probability for them to narrow is within 6 to 12 months after implantation, depending on from the stent placed. however, once you had coronary artery disease, although treated at that time, you have an independent risk factor to develop coronary artery disease again. i would recommend you to undergo a cardiac stress test, based on the above-mentioned fact, and the strain you felt in your heart area. as for the sharp pain in your left arm, my opinion is that it is not connected to coronary arteries. i hope i was of help. kind regards."

"i get a muscle like cramp in the center of my chest , just to the right , it seems like it is right under the right breastbone , ( where i can not rub it out ) ... it starts burning super bad , then i get really really hot and have a difficult time breathing , although i am taking plenty of breaths . if i lie on the floor with arms spread wide and a fan and ice pack , slowly the cramps release and after a few minutes , you can not even tell i had this episode .",1,91109,". i read your question carefully, and i understand your concern. from the information you gave, the first thing i suspect is muscle strain. the suspicion for this condition is even higher after you have done examination, even a ct scan. regarding the amoxicillin therapy, it is an antibiotic and i can't find a reason for taking that, but for sure the doctor that prescribed it had a reason for that. i do have some questions though. is the pain localized in you abdomen or between the lower ribs in your right side. the pain is steady, or it begins or worsens with movement? do you have any swelling or bruising? is it tender when you touch it? if it is more localized between your ribs, it gets worse with movements or sneezing or deep breathing, it might be tender when you touch it than probably it is just muscle strain (as i said you excluded major conditions with examination. besides this, the condition how it started (stretching too much to get something) and an acute onset, all lead to muscle strain. in general, muscle sprain can be treated with rice therapy - rest, ice application, compress and exercise. to alleviate the pain you could take pain medication like ibuprofen or naproxen. it is necessary to limit the movement of the torso (rest, but just the firs days). gentle stretching exercises can help strengthen the muscles. pain can be alleviated applying an ice pack for 15-20 minutes 2-3 times a day (ice should not be in direct contact with the skin). for a full recovery it can take 4-6 weeks. feel free for additional questions. i hope the answer helped you. best regards"

"hello . yesterday a noticed a hard ( but moveable ) bump inside my clitoral hood . it a quite sensitive and estimated size of the top of a pencil eraser . to you know what it could be ? it a definitely inside and there is no outside evidence that it a there , minus some swelling .",1,57281,"hello. thanks for asking from chat doctor. i can understand your concern. the painless bump over skull without recent history of trauma can be due to: degenerative changes - with age, our bone degenerate, and it leads to sclerosis and bone lysis. it can sometime form bony bump. it is asymptomatic, painless and noticed incidentally. treatment is observation only. ct head can confirm diagnosis, but it is needed only if there is any kind of doubt.: bony mass - sometimes bony lesions like fibrous dysplasia or osceola can cause bony swelling. the swelling may be mildly painful, hard, immobile, appears as bump like with stretched skin over it, skin free over it. to confirm it, you have to correlate your features and consult doctor. the doctor will feel it and may advise ct head to rule out it. diagnosis is confirmed by excising it and sending biopsy. small swelling less than 1 cm size may be observed even patient does not want surgery. both above swellings are benign.: calcified hematoma - it usually occurs after trauma. blood collects in skin layers and then its covering gets calcified. it presents as hard lump, mobile over skull bone, painless or may be mild pain, skin free, with history of trauma. again ct head is needed for confirmation of diagnosis. treatment is surgical excision if painful, large size, cosmetically unacceptable. you can correlate your features and reach up to some conclusion. skull flattening could be age related degeneration or bony changes associated with above-mentioned pathology. hope it will help you. thanks take care. chat doctor."

left leg from below hip to knee is numb on left side and has pain and burning sensation when a get up from a sitting position or just walking . main and burning sensation is getting worse and more frequent - what can a do ? have used heat and cold and cosemidin,3,44020,"i'm sorry to hear about your pain and how it is affecting you physical activity. now hip pain can be tricky. many times patients feel they have hip pain when actually the pain is from the sacroiliac joint. to differentiate, first imagine where you would point to if someone asked you where the most pain occurs. if the pain is in the groin and worsened with walking, climbing stairs, getting in and out of the car or a seat, it is likely hip joint pain. if the pain is actually out to the side and above your buttocks (picture someone placing their hands on their ""hips""), it is likely sacroiliac joint pain. many times patients with sacroiliac joint pain can have symptoms radiate down the leg, while hip pain typically radiates into the groin and sometimes to the same sided knee. the best way to figure the problem out is to have a x-ray of your hip and also of your low back and sacroiliac joint. i hope this answer is helpful. in either case, the good news is that stretching, anti-inflammatory medications and even a joint injection can be very helpful. i hope you feel better and get out golfing again soon!"

hello a a a 22 year old female ... a am having some period issues . by period came on at its regular time but a only spotted and after it went off a took a pregnancy test and it was negative . now 2 weeks later its coming back on and my period is extremely regular . a don to take any birth control or any morning after pills or any other medications . a have been super stressed with my job lately and have gained about 15 pounds in a month ... a a not sure if that has anything to do with it at all .,1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

(we call this osmosis phenomenon). for this effect, we need to check the blood sugar at midnight around 2am or so. if this midnight glucose level is very low, then we have to decrease your night insulin levels. therefore, the best for you is to go immediately to your treating doctor and adjust the insulin dose you are taking. regards"

a have a friend of my family who was in a car accident in october . be hit the right side of his head but did not sustain head trauma . be had multiple tests done including a mri and a and of scan . initially the doctor said they saw an tourism on the left side of the frontal lobe . when another test was done and they said there was nothing . be has been to a neurologist and was given seizure medication . be is 16 and is now suffering from migraines on the left side and when the migraine comes on his pupil get very big . be and his family on scared and getting no answers .,1,724,"hello, there could be a few reasons to your symptoms. since your blood pressure was so low, the first thought is that you were simply not getting enough blood to your brain. from you symptoms it sounds like your left hemisphere of the brain was affected given that you couldn't move your right leg and arm. language also resides most commonly in the left hemisphere, so speaking would also be difficult. you didn't mention your age, but when symptoms are isolated to a side of the brain, what needs to be done is an mr-angiogram (blood vessel imaging with mri) or ct-angiogram (blood vessel imaging with a ct) of the arteries in the neck and brain to make sure that there is no narrowing of the blood vessel that could result in the symptoms just affecting one side of the brain. if neither of those tests are possible, then as a bare minimum a carotid ultrasound should be done. alternatively, but much less likely is that you could have a migraine that caused paralysis and focal neurological symptoms. they are very rare, but still a possibility. the symptoms usually resolve in a few hours to a day. lastly, a seizure could have also occurred which caused you to lose consciousness. there is a condition where after the seizure, it takes the brain time to recover and there can be difficulty with movement and language. again, i feel that that is less likely. none-the-less you need more testing done to make sure the blood vessel are open. also, they need to investigate the cause of your low blood pressure. it can be due to a chat doctor. you should definitely speak with your primary care physician to have all of that investigated. i hope this helps. sincerely, kristoffer mission"

i am 46 with a history of endometriosis and was just diagnosed with andomysis . the opposite of endometriosis . i have found a lump in my right breast a little closer to my arm pit but not under it and it has been hurting since . off and on . my right breast also has shooting pain in it once in awhile and feels hot sometimes . i just had a memo and an ultrasound and they said it was dense breast tissue . i am scared of cancer . can you help,1,82366,"hello friend, thank you for posting your query through chat doctor. i am a homeopath answering your query and the answer which i am going to give you may contain several thoughts which may appear strange or new for you. this i say because homeopathy is a new system of medicine and is almost unheard by the majority of the population. therefore, due to the high influence of the conventional medicine the people at large are brainwashed to believe and act according to the health education given by them. coming back to the fibroadenoma of your left breast in the year 1979, you had a psychological conflict in the mind level. you are a sensitive individual and that is why your left breast was affected. it must have been related with your child chat doctor. the sensitivity is genetic, and you reacted to the conflict through the brain according to a genetic programming. mind-brain - organ affection resulted in the development of a lump in your left breast in 1979. you consulted your gynecologist, and he suggested that it may turn to become cancerous in future and so it is better to remove it, and you subdued to his suggestion. actually the lump in the breast was an attempt of the body to cure you, or it was the result of a self defense mechanism. since you had not resolved the conflict in the psychological level, the lump remained there without getting resolved. but the body kept the lump protected in a cyst with minimum amount of inflammation called chronic cystitis. by removing the fibroadenoma or chronic cystic mastitis, you were not cured, but your lump in the breast was removed. in 1995 also you are the same person, you are the same sensitive person, and you underwent another more serious psychological conflict and the same left breast was again affected in a more serious manner. instead of recognizing the mass as a defense mechanism, you got the fear in you that you have cancer. the tissue changes also suggested that there is more serious pathology, and they labelled your lump this time as cancer and suggested removal of your left breast. if you could have recognized the lump as a defense mechanism and if you had no fear of cancer, you could have retained your breast. but the fear of cancer is such that it is associated with death and so you lost your breast. in no case, either by removal of lump in 1979 or by removal of your breast in 1995, you are not cured only your disease is cured. hope by this time you have got the answer for your query. both are related to each other because they are in the same individual, same sensitivity, same program. homeopathy cures the person and once the individual is cured all his diseases will be cured. with best wishes,"

hi- a had to have a root canal redone on monday- and have had a very bad toothache since- a called the doc on wed. and he said to keep taking the clindamycin and it should get better- its now thurs morning and its still one pumping toothache - the kind that will not let you sleep- how long till these beds kick in or is something else going on here ?,1,10075,"the data you have given is not sufficient to reach a definitive diagnosis. was the tooth infected and/or operated for a root canal treatment before the crown placement? how long has it been since the rct/crown placement done? for now, with the data given, i would guess it might be due to a periodontal abscess in the region. and if there had been an infection and rct was done, chances are infection may not have resolved completely before the maturation which may have caused a periapical cyst or an abscess. a radiograph of the tooth is needed to confirm/rule out the diagnosis. if present, it may require an antibiotic and anti-inflammatory treatment and if that doesn't work you may need to get your rct redone. either case you will need to visit your dentist to get a clear picture."

a have a high indicator on one of my antibodies test . it is monoclonal gammopathy and was wondering what that indicator might be . a have sjogrens and also have sea ssh indicators for years . will monitor other in a few months but can not find info on this antibody . thanks,1,49674,hit hanks for askingbased on your query and findings my opinion is1. esr is quite high in your fathers case and is probably related to the fever and now to the joint pains. 2. esr is an indicator of an underlying disease process which raises with disease and settles to normal with resolution of the cause. it is only a prognostic indicator and not a diagnostic indicator.3. in your fathers' case it will reduce with the resolution of joint pains as chronic inflammation around joints have raised the esr.4. you need to focus on bringing down joint pains rather than worrying about a raised esr. hope this helps

"i had gallbladder surgery on an 4th , pm still feeling tired and have been experiencing pain in my upper abs area . a had a ultrasound and blood work taken yesterday which was normal but how long does it take for this feeling to go away ? a had the slls procedure which is done only thru the belly button .",1,77921,"most people who have gallstones do not have symptoms. if you have symptoms, you most likely will have mild pain in the pit of your stomach or in the upper right part of your belly. pain may spread to your right upper back or shoulder blade area. sometimes the pain is more severe. it may be steady, or it may come and go. or it may get worse when you eat. you may decide to go to the doctor because of pain in your belly. in this case, your doctor will ask you questions about when the pain started, where it is, and if it comes and goes or is always there. your doctor may order imaging tests. these take pictures of the inside of your body. an ultrasound of the belly is the best test to find gallstones. this test does not hurt. your ultrasound may not show gallstones. but if your doctor still thinks you have a problem with your gallbladder, he or she may order a gallbladder scan. in this test, a doctor injects dye into a vein in your arm. then a machine takes x-rays as the dye moves through your liver, bile duct, gallbladder, and intestine. if you do not have symptoms, you probably do not need treatment. if your first gallstone attack causes mild pain, your doctor may tell you to take pain medicine and wait to see if the pain goes away. you may never have another attack. waiting to see what happens usually will not cause problems. if you have a bad attack, or if you have a second attack, you may want to have your gallbladder removed. a second attack means you are more likely to have future attacks. many people have their gallbladders removed, and the surgery usually goes well. doctors most often use laparoscopic surgery. for this, your surgeon will make small cuts in your belly and remove your gallbladder. you will probably be able to go back to work or your normal routine in a week or two, but it may take longer for some people. sometimes the surgeon will have to make a larger cut to remove the gallbladder. it will take longer for you to recover from this type of surgery. regards and take care"

"hello , dr. lynne , a be been a type 2 diabetic since february 1999 and a a being treated for hypertension . both conditions are presently well-controlled . in september 9 of this year , blood test revealed egfr of 57 , creatine 1.36 , calcium 10.8 . by physician told me a was mildly anaemic ( a told her that a had eaten any meat for 9 months ) and she said she a test again in 3 months ( end of november ) . the also said she suspected a was dehydrated and she directed me to resume eating meat and to report for biweekly b-12 shots . blood test results taken during work-related physical on october 3 indicated egfr of 54 , creatine 1.36 ( again ) and calcium 10.8 ( again ) . showed second set of results to my physician who told me not to be too concerned and to await follow-up blood test scheduled for end of november . the does to believe a have ckd at this point and feels that the totality of my bloodworm does to justify this diagnosis . the stated that egfr values can move up and down given many factors at time of testing . a have read that once egfr diminishes , it can not recover ... doctor , is it possible that a don to yet have kidney disease ? and is it possible for egfr to improve ?",1,58987,"his am chat doctor. i have read your message. i think i can help you. first, a package test means that multiple tests are included that correlate to the test. cpk and spe can both be package tests as there are many related tests needed in a diagnosis. the symptoms that you seem to be facing as per the query is basically severe backache that increases on lying down or bending-in other words, anything that causes the spine to be under pressure. now she itself can cause the symptoms. the muscles and bone problems can arise in she itself and thus possibly one will feel that there is nothing more to do. however, in many situations, the doctors may get biased my a diagnosis. so, i think it is good that your doctor did not get biased with your pre-existing diagnosis of she and continued to look for other causes of backache. a severe backache can happen due to muscle disorders, a condition known as myopathy. the cause of myopathy may be she itself. the test commonly done to test myopathy is cpk or creatine phospholipase. this is a test done from blood. the idea is if the cpk is raised, it suggests myopathy. in this situation, your doctor will need to modify the therapy. i am unaware of your medication from the query. so i cannot really comment upon it. but some medicines themselves cause myopathy. and sometimes, the dose of existing medicines need to be stepped up for treatment of myopathy. so i presume your doctor wanted to check that. second test was spe or serum protein electrophoresis. this is one of the tests for multiple myeloma. this is a type of malignancy that affects the bones and causes bone pains and should be ruled out in middle-aged to elderly commonly if the backache is worsening and is specially bad when lying down. if the test is negative, there is nothing to worry about. if it does come out to be positive, multiple myeloma can be treated. so again you need not worry since the treatment is available. why the doctor did not tell you about the tests is something i can only speculate about. i guess it was because these are just doubts, considering you already have she- in medicine, the usual dictum is that one disease can explain the symptom, the other condition should not be sought. having said that, it's a folly to miss another diagnosis due to a pre-existing condition. i think he would have told you if the tests came out positive. so there should be nothing to worry about-the doctor was just making sure that there is no other problem. possibly since there was nothing else diagnosed, he did not tell you about it. i have tried to make it as simple as possible to understand the situation. in case there are still doubts, feel free to contact me for further details. best of luck,"

hello i have a question my young daughter who is 3 has had to episodes of nose bleeding within 24hours apart and they both occurred after she was screaming very highly would this be the reason that she is having the nose bleeds in the first place ? and should i run her to the of ?,1,40763,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the clearblue test is not very accurate in predicting gestational age. the amount of pregnancy hormone in a women urine can vary depending on the time of day she did the test and how much water she had to chat doctor. furthermore, many women have some bleeding in the first trimester of pregnancy, so the bleeding she had in december and january may not have been her real period at all. the most accurate way to test the age of a pregnancy, is an ultrasound exam to measure the fetus. this is normally done during the course of her routine prenatal care. an ultrasound is also necessary to determine if there is more than one fetus present. in your sisters case, if she conceived in november, the measurements of her uterus at this point would be accurate. so i would recommend that she have an ultrasound exam (which i am sure will be done soon as part of her routine prenatal care) to confirm her due date and the viability of the pregnancy. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes to your sister for her pregnancy,"

"my 3 year old daughter is just over viral gastroenteritis as diagnosed by my of . while she had it ( 2 weeks ) she had minor itching on her torso and limbs . since the vomiting has stopped the itching is getting worse - especially at night and she is tearing at herself and keeping herself up at night . a have tried hydrocortisone 1 % to no effect , lateran bath , is this itching related and is there anything else a can do for her ?",1,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

a have a family member who they believed may have suffered a tia a couple of years ago . the is now suffering severe short term memory loss as well as some cognitive issues . is there no real way to treat someone suffering from tia . the doctors at the time said the mri and brain scans did not show a stroke so they really assumed it was a very mild tia . the was given beds for her sever of but that was really it . again she now several years later is dealing with this memory loss . neurologist cant really say anything other than it looks like she may continue to get worse until she may not have any memory . is there any hope that she could get better from this ?,1,105496,"his am chat doctor. i have read your message. i think i can help you. first, i do not think that your prior stroke is involved. what you have described is a type of aphasia neurologically speaking. and aphasia is usually caused by a left sided brain problem-not right like you state in your query. second, if it was truly due to the stroke, the problem would have been since 2009. brain problems in stroke don't get delayed. so, i don't think that your prior stroke has anything to do with the issue. second, the main causes of aphasia are stroke and dementia. it is not a stroke as per prior ct scan, and not dementia-dementia is memory loss, and from the query, your memory is pretty good-you remember the year 2009 clearly (suggests long term memory is good), and you remember the medicines (suggests short term memory is good as well). so like your doctors, i don't think its dementia either. however, i disagree with the choice of investigations- the ct has clearly missed your pre-existing stroke as well. so i cannot be sure whether it has missed a newer stroke as well. so, i would have ideally suggested another mri brain (a more sensitive study than cat scan) and a cv doppler. however, i still don't think it is a stroke. a stroke starts suddenly. and you have definitely not said that there was a sudden onset of symptoms. if however you have forgotten to mention this in the query, you should definitely think about stroke and plan an mri and cv doppler as suggested before. third, a significant history that you have given is the loss of work and lack of hobbies and physical exercises. i won't call it depression or anxiety. and therefore i don't think your medicines will work either. in your case, the age-old adage-all work and no play makes jack a dull boy-is probably most appropriate. so my suggestion is that you need to stop smoking and get some company and daily activities. it may sound odd to you, but inactivity does take its toll. i don't think medicines are needed in your case. you just need to fill in your time with more activities so that your mind is active again. i have tried to make it as simple as possible for you to understand. feel free to ask another query with a specific doubt based on the information i have given you. i would be happy to help you further. best of luck,"

hello doctor .. a am having a question regarding my mothers blood pressure.her blood pressure usually remains high 170/95 and it can not be controlled by medicines also . is she is also a diabetic patient she is having an infection on her leg and this is further causing many problems tools i wanted to ask that how can her blood pressure can be controlled .,1,38684,"hello, thank you for your query. i understand your concerns. for ideal blood glucose control the fasting blood glucose should be less than 110 mg/dl, the 2-hour post radial blood glucose should be less than 160-170 mg/do. i am not sure of your mothers age as these values are patients who are less than 55-60 years old and who are reasonably in good health. as a person becomes older or if there is a diabetic patient who has multiple problems, then these target values would also be a little higher than too tight control of an elderly persons blood glucose will cause them to have low blood glucose (hypoglycemia) and this can cause in serious complications. i am also not sure how often your mother is taking the glycimark m and the logo 0.2 mg. assuming your mother is less than 60 years old and that she is reasonably good health, if she is taking glycimark m 40/500 only once a day then it can be increased to twice a day (15 -30 min before breakfast and before dinner). if she is already taking this tablet twice a day, then she can increase the dose of this, she can take glycimark m 80/500 twice a day. recheck her blood glucose levels in 2 weeks. if her blood glucose is still high then she can take logo 0.2 mg either twice a day (if previously she has been taking it only once) or up to three times a day (if she has been taking it only twice a day). if at any point she experienced low blood glucose symptoms like sweating, hunger, dizziness, fast heart beat, mood changes etc., then it is the glycimark-m that is causing the symptoms, and she needs to reduce the dose of this. the immediate treatment of low blood glucose is by taking a tablespoon of honey/sugar, sugar candies, glass of fruit juice or regular pepsi/coke etc. this should be followed by a carboy chat doctor. her blood pressure is fine, and she needs to continue with her advance and cretan. i hope this answer has helped you. regards"

"it seems that a am having symptoms of a bladder infection , but not sure . a feel pressure in my left lower abdomen , almost like something is in there pushing to get out . a had severe pain in the area of my ovaries last evening , but it went away . any ideas of what it may be ?",2,30579,"hi ! your flu and the diarrhea with abdominal cramps may or may not be related. in case of child chat doctor. the first diagnosis comes to the mind is a food poisoning. possibly you did not receive proper complete treatment for it and this led to more severe cramps in your abdomen. you did not mention anything about fever. if it was there, then it goes more in favor of infection in the intestines. there is no harm in taking antacid and antiflatulents, but i am not in favor of your taking enema. after any loose motions, it is but natural that the bowel becomes empty, and it takes time for the bowel to get loaded with fecal matter to get the urge of passing stool again. also, without knowing the exact cause of the cramps in your abdomen which could be any surgical cause like diverticulitis, one should not opt for an anemia. it is difficult to tell whether the swelling on the left side of your lower abdomen is due simple inflammation with mass formation or a leaking diverticulitis precipitated by self enema by yourself. in my opinion, you should consult at your earliest a general surgeon, who may advise some routine investigations for you apart from going for an ultrasound / ct scan depending on the initial examination findings. one more possibility of the swelling is left sided inguinal hernia, but your history does not go much in favor of it. anyways i think it is time for you to see your general surgeon and seek his advice. good luck."

"i my name is erika a went to the dentist nov 13th to get a wisdom tooth out . now i keep getting sinus infections , a took a 10 day dose of anti-biotics but my infection came back with a cold and another sinus infection and this morning a woke up with a swollen face on the side where the wisdom tooth was pulled . a need advice on which doctor to go to a done have insurance and a done want to be going to three different doctors , should a go back to the dentist , a reg of doctor or a ear nose and throat doctor ? thank you erika martin",1,57293,"hi. welcome to chat doctor. as per your complaint it seems that you have inflammation of the gum flap surrounding the wisdom tooth and the condition is known as peritonitis. pericoronitis occurs if food gets lodged between wisdom tooth and the gum flap covering the wisdom tooth... and by food it does not mean that you see big food particles stuffed in there, but it also means uncleaned area and bacterial growth below gum flap... it leads to inflammation of the flap leading to pain swelling and as the area lies close to the throat there can be sore throat and swollen lymph nodes. but pain in the tooth in front of the wisdom tooth can be infection or decay in second molar tooth. the line of treatment is antibiotics, painkillers, mouthwash but only this is not enough to you, you should go to dentist again and ask him to irrigate the area between gum flap and wisdom tooth with saline, betadine solution and hy chat doctor. . other thing is done warm saline gargles, it will help you to reduce inflammation... carry on with the course of your antibiotics and painkillers, your pain and swelling must go in two three days. once you get relieved of your discomfort visit the dentist again and get an iop ar (x-ray) done to find out whether wisdom tooth will erupt to proper occlusion or is impacted (means having an obstruction and won't erupt to occlusion). if it is not impacted just get your gum flap removed known as operculectomy and if impacted get your tooth extracted... this will be your ultimate treatment and finish your problem forever. if the second molar tooth is also decayed leading to pain you can get root canal treatment done to save the tooth and resolve infection. hope you recover soon. thanks and regards."

hello my name is carissa bernard i am 12 years old and for the past year i have been dealing with bouts of severe abdominal pain . the bouts occur every 14-20 days . i have been to 8 doctors and gotten many tests whicchatdoctore back normal . it would be a blessing to me and my family if i could get an answer .,1,56216,"hi thanks for choosing chat doctor for your medical query. i'm sorry but your question is deficient in a lot of information that would have been very helpful for me to answer. you have not mentioned if this was the first episode of pain, or she has past history. you did not mention if she hd any accompanying symptoms like diarrhea, vomiting, blood in stool or vomits, fever, pallor or jaundice. was her abdomen tender to touch? has the pain gotten worse, or it has subsided in intensity? is it only present in the upper abdomen or has it shifted to some other area or extended further? you also did not specify which tests and scans were ordered and came out negative. i can infer that the pain was very severe from the fact that she was hospitalized. upper abdominal pain can be due to a number of causes she might have pancreatitis, cholecystitis or peptic ulcer. pancreatic enzyme levels, ultrasound scan and h pylori antigen should be performed to rule out these conditions. as you have mentioned she had work up done at a hospital so i assume she was evaluated for these conditions. if all other tests are normal she may have functional abdominal pain. it is common amongst girls between the ages of 5 years to 14 years. it is because of an altered mechanism for pain perception so that the affected individual is more sensitive to pain. no definitive cause for this pain can be found but that does not mean it's not real. it usually presents in anxious child chat doctor. it is usually accompanied by other symptoms like recurrent diarrhea, constipation and headaches. the usual sites are around the umbilicus and in the upper abdomen. if your child has been worked up fully for all serious condition the best course of action is to reassure her. try to eliminate stress as much as possible, incorporate soluble fibers in her diet. probiotics are also helpful. do not limit her activities due to pain and try not to let her miss school. talk to her teachers and explain to them the situation. do not dismiss her pain as nothing, acknowledge its presence but try to make your child see that she has to continue her activities in a normal fashion. hope my answer helps you if you have any father questions i would be happy to answer."

hello doctor i have a problem of varicocelectomg but i done have a child in my family my is in india so he can a help me or guide me at this moment doctor told me that i have to go for laser operation so is important for this laser operation for me i am 39 yrs old a my wife is 34 yrs old she is in india right now after two months i am going to india what is better for me,1,36900,"hi, i guess your concern is wife not getting pregnant after 2 yrs of marriage, right? i got the picture what you are going through. don't worry i am here to help you sir. let's start discussing with the information you have shared with us. when you were a kid you got operated at penis. then heard the doctor saying you may not become a father. but sir what kind of operation it is? you haven't shared, or you may not be knowing as you were kid at that time. so cant say whether that operation is causing this problem. anyway let's keep this kid operation aside. you haven't shared how old is your wife? what her exact age is? is it a late marriage. if it's a late marriage then getting pregnant takes some time sir. have patience. women from 18-40 years of reproductive age group, the chances of pregnancy are high, after 50 years, chances of pregnancy are very less, and 42-45-transition zone, chances are not as high as reproductive age neither as less than after 50 years. you have to judge where wife stands, where? i would like to focus on the medical term-fertile period. it is from 10th-16th day of menses cycle where chances of becoming pregnant are very, very high. here sperm fertilizes ovum and women become pregnant, that's why it's called fertile period. well, with above discussion you can try out my suggestions:1. have patience, things will settle down slowly.2. i insist you and your wife to do sex in fertile period (mechanism i have told above). do this for next 6-8 months. you will get results by this time.3. if you are in a hurry, or you want to really know is that your kid operation is hindering you from becoming father, you can visit your nearby gynecologist or infertility specialist for sorting of things. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"a have had recurring lower back pain for about 2weeks . a initially experienced it when a slept in a bed away from home so assumed it was just the bed . however , since then , the symptoms have continued , initially fairly constant so took advil and applied heat .... with some relief . however , the discomfort does not feel like the typical muscle spasms a have experienced in the past . it times , it seems more pronounced on the left side . it times , it disappears all together . but it recurs at site after a have bee sleeping for a few hours and it is difficult to find a comfortable position . abdominal discomfort accompanies it at times as does a boating feeling . a also feel more tired than usual .",1,91109,". i read your question carefully, and i understand your concern. from the information you gave, the first thing i suspect is muscle strain. the suspicion for this condition is even higher after you have done examination, even a ct scan. regarding the amoxicillin therapy, it is an antibiotic and i can't find a reason for taking that, but for sure the doctor that prescribed it had a reason for that. i do have some questions though. is the pain localized in you abdomen or between the lower ribs in your right side. the pain is steady, or it begins or worsens with movement? do you have any swelling or bruising? is it tender when you touch it? if it is more localized between your ribs, it gets worse with movements or sneezing or deep breathing, it might be tender when you touch it than probably it is just muscle strain (as i said you excluded major conditions with examination. besides this, the condition how it started (stretching too much to get something) and an acute onset, all lead to muscle strain. in general, muscle sprain can be treated with rice therapy - rest, ice application, compress and exercise. to alleviate the pain you could take pain medication like ibuprofen or naproxen. it is necessary to limit the movement of the torso (rest, but just the firs days). gentle stretching exercises can help strengthen the muscles. pain can be alleviated applying an ice pack for 15-20 minutes 2-3 times a day (ice should not be in direct contact with the skin). for a full recovery it can take 4-6 weeks. feel free for additional questions. i hope the answer helped you. best regards"

"okay , so a had the demo injection 2 weeks ago today and was advised to use condoms because a was to on my period but the wednesday after , the condom split . to about 13 hours after a took the morning after pill ( the doctor said it would be 95 % effective because it was within the first twenty four hours ) and since the friday after the unprotected sex , a be had this weird pain when urinating , like a uti . it a now nearly 2 weeks after the unprotected sex and a a worried that a would be pregnant or have an sti . a friend says it could be due to the mass of hormones a took in such a short period of time but a don to want to be 17 & pregnant .",1,22940,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, the depo-provera injection becomes immediately effective against pregnancy the day you get the shot. the reason why it is recommended for you to start taking demo while you have your period is to make sure that you have not already become pregnant and get the injection while pregnant. so if you had a shot two weeks ago, even if you had a condom accident, and especially since you took morning-after pill, there is no reason to suspect that you are risk for pregnancy. however, a urinary tract infection, which is inflammation of the bladder, can occur after sex if chafing during sex especially externally rubs bacteria into the urethra (the urinary opening). this is common in women who use condoms as the ring on the condom can irritate this area during penetration. so i think you can be reassured that your symptoms are not due to pregnancy. however, i think you most likely do have a uti and should visit your local physician or clinic for evaluation, so you can get a prescription for antibiotics to treat it. if you are now going to be having unprotected sex with your current partner, you both should be tested for stds to make sure that you are not at risk of giving anything to one another. however, this point there is no evidence that your symptoms could be caused by an std. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

by sister ( age 61 ) reports a lump on her back ( left shoulder blade area ) which has grown in the past year and now causes pain when she tries to sleep on her left side . the lump is the size of a small mandarin orange and it bled when she tried to squeeze it . should she go to an emergency or get an appointment with a dermatologist ?,1,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"hello sir , my grandmother is suffering from paralysis attack from a month , her left part of the body doesn't work ( she can feel sensation ) ! her age is near about 70 years ! what type of exercise is required and also she is not able to eat ( swallow ) any type of food but she can drink .. please advice which kind of juice or anything we should give her ?",1,52429,"hello hiram.ks10, thank you for posting your query through chat doctor. i can understand your concern for your granny. radiation is the method of treatment of choice for this type of cancers by the conventional medicine. you can ask for the outcome what the doctors expect out of the treatment and the percentage of chances for her to get cured and survive. i am a homeopath, and so i will be advising you differently, and it is for you to take the judicious decision about it. in my opinion your granny must have undergone a shocking psychological conflict at this age almost prior to the development of the stricture of the esophagus. on examination of the throat for difficulty in swallowing it was found out that esophagus is having this deformity. it is said that she had an experience of something that she could not swallow. now you may go back to her life situations and find out whether she had anything that she could not swallow. get to know what she felt- whether rejection, indignation, grief, rage, depression etc.- towards this incident. this will tell her genetics. the cause of any cancer is in the mind and is mediated through the brain. which tissue is to be affected and what should be the type of affection-all these are determined by the mind-brain - organ axis. give her homeopathic constitutional treatment for giving maximum possible longevity of relatively healthful days ahead. abstain from radiation or any other unnatural surgical procedures. if you so desire, i can help her by taking her case in detail and prescribe for her, her genetic constitutional curative remedy. give counselling to her in the fashion i explained her disease above and request her to have positive attitudes to the incident and to her present disease condition. with best wishes, chat doctor. j. varese, homeopath,"

yes want to some of the signs to early pregnancies i guess am pregnant but am not certain because i was on pills to avoid pregnancies and also had my menses again in two weeks after the actual date and since then i have been having regularly want to know the cause,1,106329,"hi there,it must be really traumatic to lose two pregnancies one after another. sorry for your loss. i need to know a few things about you, 1. your age?2. your partners age?3. since how long have you been trying to conceive?4. are you taking folic acid?5. do you have any medical problems such as thyroid, epilepsy, diabetes, she?6. are you on any medications, if so which? usually, 1 in 6 pregnancies miscarry, which is fairly common. two consecutive miscarriages are also seen in about 3% of the women. but if a woman has 3 miscarriages in a row we need to check for problems. i would advise you to try to conceive and take folic acid 5 mg at least three months before getting pregnant. once pregnant follow up regularly with your doctor, most women after 2 miscarriages go on to have normal full term pregnancies. unfortunately in a few if miscarriage happens do send the aborts for chromosomal analysis, as that could give us a clue to the cause. hope this helps. regards."
yes want to some of the signs to early pregnancies i guess am pregnant but am not certain because i was on pills to avoid pregnancies and also had my menses again in two weeks after the actual date and since then i have been having regularly want to know the cause,2,74652,"hallow dear, trust pills are birth control pills having ethanol estradiol, levonorgestrel and ferrous fumarate. the last is iron to complete 28 days. first two are the hormonal components which give the effect of birth control. after getting the menses, you shifted to daphne which contains lynestrenol (progesterone). both these pills are good birth control pills provided they are consumed regularly. however, i would suggest you to stick to trust. you had sexual intercourse 3 days after your menstruation while on the pills. so the chances of the pregnancy are very rare. when you are taking birth control pills regularly, you are well protected from the pregnancy, whenever you may have intercourse. moreover, your intercourse was not during the fertile period. !4 days prior to the next menses (when you are not on pills), the egg release (ovulation) occurs. egg has got a life of 24 hours and sperms are active for 72 hours. hence, a period of about one week around the day of ovulation is considered as fertile period. your intercourse was far away from this period. also, you are not having any feel of the pregnancy too. furthermore, you are on the pills regularly. so you are not forming eggs. therefore, most probably you are not pregnant. the delay in your menstruation may be due to change and irregularity in the composition of the pills. progesterone only pills are known to cause less bleeding. delay by two days should not be considered as delay. still to confirm the diagnosis, please wait for 1 week more and then perform urine pregnancy test on the overnight morning first urine sample. earlier these tests may give false negative results. if you do not want to wait that long, you may go for beta chat doctor test which gives reliable results even few days before missing period. this should take away your stress. and finally, even if the pills have failed (which is very rare) and you are pregnant, you can terminate the pregnancy safely by medicines up to 9 weeks. i hope this helps you."
