"a just found out a have genital herpes and a done know any details ... would a of had this for awhile and not known or gave it to anyone ? a had a severe mouth infection on the inside with sores inside mouth mostly on tongue was put on valtrex for that , , , could this be latter of that ? can a still have oral sex ?",1,35013,"hi, thanks for posting in chat doctor. i understand your concern. genital herpes is a disease caused by the herpes simplex virus (hsv). hsv is of two types: 1. type 1 (hsv-1), which usually causes oral herpes in the form of infection of the lips and mouth. symptoms are commonly known as cold sores or fever blisters. in the past, hsv-1 was not known to cause genital herpes, but that is changing, especially among people who begin having sex at a young age. 2. type 2 (hsv-2), which, in most cases, causes genital herpes. hsv-1 is usually passed from person to person by kissing. hsv-1 can also spread from the mouth to the genitals during oral sex. if infection occurs, it becomes a case of genital herpes.hsv-2 is most often passed by vaginal sex and anal sex. but just as hsv-1 can infect the genitals and cause genital herpes, hsv-2 can pass from one person's genitals to another persons mouth, resulting in oral herpes. hence, hsv-1 can also be transmitted to the genitals through oral/genital sex and about 40% of genital herpes is caused by hsv-1. it would be advisable not to have oral sex at this stage as it carries a risk for transmission of infection. hope the information provided would be helpful. all the best."

"year air , a have a son who is become 2 years old this an 12 . since march 2011 he has been getting constant cold and later developing in wheezing . this is a recurrent issue happen twice in a month . be has been admitted twice in 2011 for this condition . the latest one being december for which the medicines prescribed were as follows pulmicort , actrovent , ventolin , innate , expect , zyrtec and nycomed . a am very worried",1,607,"ventolin (albuterol) is a bronchodilator and your doctor has prescribed it because often in case of such cough, bronchospasm occurs. he has not prescribed the wrong medicine. but if you feel that she does not have wheezing, you may skip giving it and reserve if for times of respiratory distress, if it occurs. the side effect of ventolin is increased heart rate but let me assure you that this is a very widely used medicine and well tolerated and so you need not worry about the side effects. give your child steam inhalation twice or thrice a day and i think that she would get some relief. also add some antiallergic syrup like relent which will also help in diluting the cough. the cold has been caused by a viral infection and generally takes 5-7 days to recover. please be patient till then."

"by daughter was born with what looked like a bruise on her shoulder , she is 14 months , now it has turned to a mushy lump and it is still blue in color.its about the size of a dime . a done think that it causes any pain , she has no reaction when a touch it . should a be concerned",1,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"occasionally , maybe 5 or 6 times a year , maybe more , just below left side of lower lip feels numb . all the way down to my chin . this sometimes spreads around my mouth only on left side . when my lips start to tingle . the whole thing usually lasts 20-30 minutes but the initial numbness on lower left side of lip and chin lingers on and off sometimes for a day or two . that do you think is happening ?",1,45642,"don't worry. the lower tooth is supplied by a nerve on each side called the mandibular nerve that supplies the tooth and the lower lip and chin on each side. there has been some trauma to the mandibular nerve that supplied the teeth, tongue, and lip on that side. this can range from a tingling to total numbness of these areas. healing of nerve tissue is a slow process but in almost all cases comes back. it can take from a few days to few months. tingling is a good sign and the damage is not as severe as total numbness. waiting, at this time, is your only recourse. there are surgical procedures to reattach the nerve if injured, but with your dentist the only one who might know the extent of injury, i would suggest that you wait and see if the numbness does resolve. be patient and time should take care of the problem. good luck."

"i , a was just worried , a a 16 and just recently a feel my tight and heavy and mild pain in my chest , it hurts a little more when a lie on my back and a lot worse when a swallow food but not when a drink , it only hurts when a seem to expand my chest . to you think you can tell me the problem ? should a see a doctor ?",1,94135,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. many women get pain in their chest from reflux or gastritis. when your stomach starts to secrete acid, like when you eat, the pain may get worse. acid reflux literally means that the acid from your stomach sloshes up into your esophagus, and that can cause it to spasm, which you are feeling when you lie down. taking your german at the full adult dose (150 mg) daily will gradually help the symptoms, but i also suggest you purchase a calcium-containing antacid (like tums) and take two whenever you feel the spasms or pain in your shoulder. trying to only eat upright and staying upright at least 2 hours after eating will help to reduce the reflux as well. if you always feel the pain when you lie down, try to prop yourself up on pillows, so your head is higher than the rest of your body. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

i ... a be had a hide scan twice .. first time my number was a 57 . the second time it was a 70 . the pain in my rib cage is bad and a am sick a lot .. a was wondering since a got a 70 the second time shouldn't a not have anymore attacks . a done have any gallstones,1,53629,"hi, how are you? my name is chat doctor. i am a liver and pancreas surgeon and i hope to answer your question today. i am sorry that you are having these symptoms. an ultrasound can be used to see the contractability of the gall bladder if the first scan is done on a fasting state and a second scan is repeated after a meal. the gb usually contracts to empty its contents into the intestine after eating, esp a fatty meal. unfortunately this is not a very sensitive indicator. a hide scan on the other hand provides real time imaging of the gb and hence can visualize the gb contracting and emptying the radio active substance given into the intestine and based on how much content it empties, the percentage contractility is measured. your ejection of 6% is definitely on the lower side esp if the function was measured in response to a meal or a special hormone administered during the scan. i take it that they have not found any gb stones on any of your usg scans as it could explain your symptoms. i would advise you to get an amylase level done the next time you suffer a bout of back pain to rule out pancreatitis. hope this helps and hope you start to feel better. pl do not hesitate to contact me for any further clarifications needed. have a great day"

i .i have long history of kidney stones now ultrasound gives minimal fullness of collecting system of of stones now there . is mild bilateral dull pain tolerated pain goes without analgesic my question is is that dangerous and may affect kidney function,1,34445,"hi, thanks for writing in. the collecting system of the kidney is made of renal calyxes and pelvis. this collects the urine formed in kidney and transports it through the ureter (tubes connecting kidneys and urinary bladder) to the urinary bladder. the pelvicalyceal system is the mouth of the kidney where it connects with the upper end of the ureter. i guess that you have got ultrasound scan done, and it shows mild fullness of the pelvicalyceal system in the left kidney, that is a term applied to increase in diameter of the collecting system in your left kidney. it is not a critical situation, and please do not worry if you do not have any urinary symptoms. since it is mentioned as mild fullness and no kidney stones have been found, therefore(i) it can be that your bladder was completely full at the of ultrasound scan(ii) your kidney pelvicalyceal system is appearing full by itself (extrarenal pelvis) and is an extension of normal appearance.(iii) rarely an infection of urinary system and kidneys (recent or old) can cause such a finding, but this is likely only if you have symptoms like pain in the region of kidney and problems like burning urination or discoloration of urine or any kidney infections in the past.(iv) stones in kidney or ureter can also cause fullness of pelvicalyceal system and since you do not have any stone therefore this does not apply to you. it is important to know if your scan was repeated after passing urine and still there was persistent mild fullness of the pelvicalyceal system on left side. this can also be confirmed by doing an mvp which is injecting a contrast and taking 5 to 6 x-rays to study the functioning of the kidneys in a better way. please consult the urologist."

i so about 3 or 4 weeks ago a was rough housing with a male friend at work and he slammed his body on me and a ended up hitting the rail with my breast a felt pain for a while after that and it was still a little swollen so a did to think anything of it a never had any issues before that and now a have lump where the trauma took place could this be because the tissue is dead or ? ? a a just scared and want some type of answers a am 24 years old thank you !,1,82366,"hello friend, thank you for posting your query through chat doctor. i am a homeopath answering your query and the answer which i am going to give you may contain several thoughts which may appear strange or new for you. this i say because homeopathy is a new system of medicine and is almost unheard by the majority of the population. therefore, due to the high influence of the conventional medicine the people at large are brainwashed to believe and act according to the health education given by them. coming back to the fibroadenoma of your left breast in the year 1979, you had a psychological conflict in the mind level. you are a sensitive individual and that is why your left breast was affected. it must have been related with your child chat doctor. the sensitivity is genetic, and you reacted to the conflict through the brain according to a genetic programming. mind-brain - organ affection resulted in the development of a lump in your left breast in 1979. you consulted your gynecologist, and he suggested that it may turn to become cancerous in future and so it is better to remove it, and you subdued to his suggestion. actually the lump in the breast was an attempt of the body to cure you, or it was the result of a self defense mechanism. since you had not resolved the conflict in the psychological level, the lump remained there without getting resolved. but the body kept the lump protected in a cyst with minimum amount of inflammation called chronic cystitis. by removing the fibroadenoma or chronic cystic mastitis, you were not cured, but your lump in the breast was removed. in 1995 also you are the same person, you are the same sensitive person, and you underwent another more serious psychological conflict and the same left breast was again affected in a more serious manner. instead of recognizing the mass as a defense mechanism, you got the fear in you that you have cancer. the tissue changes also suggested that there is more serious pathology, and they labelled your lump this time as cancer and suggested removal of your left breast. if you could have recognized the lump as a defense mechanism and if you had no fear of cancer, you could have retained your breast. but the fear of cancer is such that it is associated with death and so you lost your breast. in no case, either by removal of lump in 1979 or by removal of your breast in 1995, you are not cured only your disease is cured. hope by this time you have got the answer for your query. both are related to each other because they are in the same individual, same sensitivity, same program. homeopathy cures the person and once the individual is cured all his diseases will be cured. with best wishes,"

( a am trying to get in to see someone today who takes my insurance ) .,2,108096,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. it is true that theoretically you should have been clear of the injection within three months of discontinuation, however many women after being a depo-provera for a long time do not resume having ovulatory, regular, menstrual cycles until 6 to 9 months or even up to a year after discontinuation. unfortunately, it is difficult to artificially induce ovulation in women who are coming off depo-provera. if you were not trying to become pregnant, your cycle could be regulated temporarily with birth control pills, but if you're actually trying to get pregnant the best thing you can do with this point is to just keep trying and wait and see. if you feel any symptoms of pregnancy, and you haven't gotten your period for a while, i would do pregnancy test just to make sure. there is always a possibility even if your periods are not regular that you do ovulate sometimes. so in summary, continue having unprotected sex every other to every three days and give it some more time. 80% of couples will conceive within one year, and if after a year of trying you and your partner are unsuccessful, it might be a good idea to see a fertility specialist for an evaluation. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes, and good luck getting pregnant,"

i my son was at the doctors office today and it was noted he had high ketones and both blood and protein in the urine . the doctor immediately put him on an antibiotic but said it will need further investigations ? be is 2 yrs old he is one developing a cough ?,1,9445,"hellothanks for usingchatdoctor for your health problems. i read careful your question and understood your concern. you doesn't explained clearly why your dad was prescribed the antibiotic and antimicrobial therapy anyway i presume that it has an infection when he was discharged. the infectious disease and maybe the psychologic stress that is caused by the infection can raise the blood glucose in a diabetic person. his blood glucose is high and nausea can be a symptom of diabetic ketoacidosis. diabetic ketoacidosis is a serious complication of diabetes that occurs when your body produces high levels of blood acids called ketones. for this reason my advice is to check his ketone level in the blood and in the urine. if the result is positive you need to take him in an emergency room as soon as possible because it can be dangerous if it is not treated. in most cases, people with diabetic ketoacidosis need to be treated in hospital. if the test of ketones in his blood and urine is negative, i suggest consulting an endocrinologist in your area because in my opinion the metformin monotherapy is not effective, and it is necessary to add another antidiabetic chat doctor. i want to remember that the diabetic diet and more physical activities(if not contraindicated)are other important elements for the control of your dads' diabetes. i recommend to not be negligent. hope i have answered to your question. if you have further queries, feel free and ask. for treatment recommendations, and individual therapy, you can ask me at chat doctor at my private link: bit.do/chatdoctor-"

i have got my blood test days back . in that bilirubin direct is 0.27 mg/dl . my age is 47. and also 2 years back doctor told me that there is a minor stone in my gall bladder . is this related to bilirubin direct . and what precautions should i take to cure this . also is there any serious concern .,1,65018,"hi thanks for the question. i assume that your baby is more than a week old. most of the babies have yellow discoloration of skin and sclera during the first few days of life. this is called physiological jaundice, and it subsides on its own without any intervention. this is a normal phenomenon as a result of transition from fetal to extrauterine life. you should be aware when jaundice is a cause of concern: 1. if jaundice appears on first day of life2. if the level of bilirubin is more than 12 mg/dl. bilirubin is the substance that causes the yellow coloration of skin. its level can be checked with a blood test .3. if the rise in bilirubin level is more than 5 mg/dl/hr. for this your doctor my prescribe repeated test and then plot the levels on a graph to predict the expected rise in bilirubin.4. if direct bilirubin is more the 2 mg/dl or 20% of the total. bilirubin is of two types physiological jaundice is due to the water insoluble indirect bilirubin so if direct component is high it means it's not physiological and should be a cause for concern. the direct and indirect breakage is given in the blood test. 5. if your baby is otherwise unwell e.g. is lethargic, is not feeding well, has fever or difficulty breathing then its not physiological jaundice because in that case your baby will be otherwise totally ok. you have asked if your baby needs incubator care. incubators are for premature babies who can not maintain their body temperatures as they have arrived earlier, and temperature control mechanisms have not yet been established. the incubator provides specific temperature. incubators are not used for the treatment of any type of jaundice. phototherapy is used for that. these are specially lights that convert the indirect water insoluble bilirubin into water soluble forms that can then be excreted out through urine. as i have told high levels of direct bilirubin are a cause of concern and these need treatment with a phototherapy unit. your doctor may prescribe phototherapy if your child has any of the criteria i have mentioned earlier, but incubator care is not needed as your baby is not premature and is at least older than a week. if you have any other questions i will be happy to answer."

"when a was little a friend of my mods would try to beat confessions out of me , trying to get me to admit a did things that her own son was responsible for , she would hold me underwater in the bathtub till a nearly drowned and she would repeat this till a confessed . could this cause mental or physical damage that would affect you six or seven years later ?",1,27023,"hi, thanks for writing to us, as you have explained, your daughter has had a difficult childhood being brought up by a single mother. she also might have witnessed her fathers' attitude towards the family or towards you who is her mother and as you say he was promiscuous. she has not had a father figure in her life and may have had improper parental supervision for many of these stated reasons. all this can have a negative impact on the development of a children personality. a person can have deviant personality traits which make them more vulnerable to problems like addiction or excessive usage of things like the internet and mobile phones to an extent of neglect of routine activities, seeking fulfillment of emotional needs from strangers, especially of the opposite gender or confabulating or manipulating by making up stories in order to get what they want. firstly it would be advisable to get a detailed psychiatric evaluation at this point to rule out the possibility of any underlying mental illness. to make sure she does not truly believe the stories she has been telling people. you also need to make sure she is not having any genuine adjustment problems in the hostel. if this happens to be her way of manipulating you into getting her out of hostel then it would be advisable to keep her in the hostel till she gets used to it eventually. get in touch with her hostel authorities and try to be aware of her behavior and also see if they can help you out by keeping her constantly engaged in some activities by making a schedule for her daily activities till late in the evening, by including sports, studies, projects, monitoring etc. this would help her a great deal. hope this helps, chat doctor."

for the last several months my right foot is burning inside and hurts so bad . when a first noticed it was after new years and a thought maybe a might of had too much fun and injured it . to way a be had pulled muscles and such this is unlike anything a be ever felt . even right now sitting up on the couch with legs up a can feel the burning inside come and go . its in between the top and bottom of foot on the inside and starts from mid toe up the side of my foot going half way up foot . some times a can do things without any pain and other times not and sometimes not moving at all it still burns often its like a sharp burn .,1,9369,"cannot say what in your particular case without direct examination. but i can say everything that is in the foot includes bones, joints, tendons, circulation, and muscle. with a lot of pressure there can be stress fractures of the bone. they give intense, constant pain. the joints and tendons can get strained. this occurs most in the part of the foot with the most bend (the middle at the top or in the arch). this area goes up and down in pain during the day. it goes up with use, it hurts when that part is bent either by flexing the foot or by directly moving that area. muscle can hurt; they have a particular muscle ache. there are no prominent muscles in the top middle of the foot, more joints and tendons. circulation can make the whole foot ache and there has to be signs of poor circulation. the pain comes either with use, with blue swelling, or with lack of blood, being pale/white/cold and achy with use but would be the whole foot (really, really doubtful in this case). joints and tendons are helped with changes in shoes and activity, with aspirin like chat doctor."

"a am 29 yrs old last period 6 was ago , blocked tubes not by choice , never been more than 5 days late , neg hot , nausea , bloating , lowers abdomen distended and hard , uterus and cervix are very low in vaginal cana , very fatigued , sore breasts . what could cause this ?",1,40826,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, if you have been using contraception (even a barrier method) every time you have sex, your chance of pregnancy is extremely low no matter what your symptoms are. secondly, having occasional abnormal vaginal discharge is more likely a symptom of a vaginal infection than pregnancy. slight bleeding can be caused if the vaginal canal is very irritated, and if your discharge is thick, there is a possibility you may have a vaginal yeast infection that is causing inflammation in the vagina. pregnancy symptoms vary widely between women, but the most common sign of pregnancy is missing your period. nausea, fatigue, bloating, breast tenderness and mood changes are some other symptoms that are commonly associated with pregnancy, however all these can also be caused by irregular hormone production. so if your period is not late, i strongly believe that your symptoms are likely due to an infection in your vagina rather than pregnancy symptoms. i recommend evaluation by a gynecologist or your women's health provider to examine your vagina and determine the cause of the discharge. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was helpful. best wishes,"

"a have been experiencing pain in the area directly below where my rib cage ends on the left side for the past week . a am very active and initially thought that a had pulled a muscle . the pain is severe at times resulting in me actually yelling out when a cough , breath in deeply , turn over in bed , and ever bend over to tie my shoes . a can pinpoint the pain by pressing on the soft tissue area following along the curvature of my rib cage . is it possible that something is going on with my spleen ? according to my research that is the organ that is located in that area .",1,41649,"hello. thank you for your question and welcome to chat doctor. i understand your concern. well, i am going to try and explain the differences between various origins of the pain which can arise from the rib cage. there is angina. it is described more like mid-chest heaviness or squeezing sensation, that is triggered by exercise and relieved by rest, which radiates to the both sides of the chest, to the jaw and left arm and shoulder. it is indicative of a blockage within one or more coronary arteries and reflects the lowering of blood supply to the heart muscle. an ekg obtained in the moment of chest pain, if it fills this description, would be helpful. then there is pleuritic chest pain. this kind of pain is sharp, stabbing pain that can happen in any part of the chest area. no radiation like in anginal pain. it arises from acute or chronic inflammation of the linings that are within the rib cage: pleura (lining of the lungs) or pericardium (lining of the heart) or both. in this regard, i would recommend a chest x-ray for pleural inflammation or effusion. in case of pericardial pain and anginal pain, echocardiogram is helpful, by evaluating the size, motility and function of heart muscle and valves, and also by assessing the pericardium and whether there is fluid build-up within it, or not. other causes of chest pain are related to the locomotion system of the rib cage: muscle soreness, bone and cartilage-related pain. in the end, stress can also cause chest pain. i hope i was helpful with my answer. best regards,"

a have trade iii piles . today i had my blood checkup and found that my plate counts is somewhere 87.1 and suffering from basophils and leucotopenia . that does that indicate ? a often bleed once or twice a week . it is due to piles or something else ? ? ply answer . pm very much worried,1,38184,"i am glad that you have put up your query at chat doctor. piles or hemorrhoids is a condition wherein the veins in the rectum get engorged due to a backflow of blood from the liver which is responsible for processing and detoxifying the food that we eat and digest. it can also be caused due to constipation which causes abrasions in the rectum causing it to bleed. the piles get relief on using stool softness like isabel husk or lactulose syrup. relief is also obtained by site bath wherein you have to sit with the anal opening dipped in water so warm that the skin can take. unless there are issues with improper hygiene causing microbes to be passed on to the baby, there is no direct relation of piles with the baby breastfeeding. you can continue breastfeeding the baby and need not be concerned."

hello sir am a psychotic patient under risperidone therapy.though my thinking pattern is normal i feel depressed all the time . due to sideeffects of antidepressants my psychiatrist has stopped it.what should i do now ? can risperidone cause depression.my father is also a psychotic under treatment with risperidone and antidepressant and is doing well .,1,35260,hi dear good to see you. i understand your concern. no risperidone does not cause depression. feeling like depression is the part of illness itself. or sometimes psychotic illness co morbid with depressive features. i do not think so antidepressant in a low dose can lead to serious side effects. i suggest to stat antidepressant which has low side effect like ssri if you have depressive features but sometimes negative features of psychotic illness look like depression. so need to differentiate between this two. risperidone has no role in depression at all. yes olanzapine has dual role it is anti-psychotic but useful in depression also. so take proper advise and start antidepressant in low dose and get well soon. if you have q query then feel free to ask. thank you. take care.

a had surgery for tarsal coalition about 11 years ago . but recently my foot is in a lot of pain . when i walk form maybe 10-15 minutes my foot become swollen and is in pain for the whole day . it has been getting worse since the past few years . why is this happening ?,1,48791,"hi, thank you for providing the brief history of you. a thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised. as your chief complaint is that when you walk there is a sharp pain in the lateral side of the left foot, i suspect it to be muscular pain or either neuropathic pain for which a thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised. also. when there is a nerve impingement in the lumbar spine, it all starts with the pain in most cases on the lateral side of the foot. as you even mentioned that you had a bony injury in the past, there might be a tendency of abnormal gait during that time and shortening of muscles of the spine due to walking in pain. as i feel, by strengthening the muscles of the core, spine, pelvic floor and lower limbs on both sides you should be able to walk. since the nerve impingement gives the initial symptoms as pain in the lateral side of the foot and progresses over a period of time. so before it gets more on future you can get an mri of lumbar spine and them proceed with physical therapy for the lumbar spine. in my clinical experience i see cases who initially comes with this sort of pain and later with nerve impingement diagnosis. so, from past couple of years i have noticed that this is the first alerting symptom of the neurological pain, so now i deal with first an mri of spine and core stability. results come on 3-4 weeks of time and post which in future complaints are less regards jay in chat doctor."

"had pain in chest and lungs when drinking a small glass of water this morning ... hurt so much i was hunched over , also got very dizzy and short of breath ... done know if that part was from anxiety because i was scared but i almost blacked out ... super scared .. whats happening ? thanks",1,15046,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. feeling short of breath is not unusual while you're pregnant because the hormones of pregnancy actually have a way of telling your brain to breathe faster. this is to ensure that your baby gets enough oxygen, because as your belly gets bigger your lungs are not able to expand as well. so many women feel the sensation of needing to catch their breath all the time when they breathe when they are in the third trimester. in addition, because you would have been on bed rest for so long, you probably are not in very good cardiovascular shape. another possible reason why you could be feeling short of breath is that there is a possibility that you are anemic. normally, as part of routine prenatal care we check your blood count as well is a test for gestational diabetes somewhere between 24 and 28 weeks. if you've not yet had this test, it might be a good idea to mention your symptoms to your doctor. of course, there can be some serious, dangerous things that can cause shortness of breath; like blood clots that spread to your lung, or fluid in the lungs and other pulmonary problems. if you experience any chest pain or severe shortness of breath or start developing a productive cough, you should notify your doctor immediately and possibly go to the hospital for evaluation. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

explain about stem cell therapy,2,93319,hit hank you for your question to chat doctor. stem cell therapy is an experimental therapy. stem cell injections in the spinal cord have been described for spinal cord injury patients with paraplegia. spinal cord stimulator can be inserted for pain relief but stem cell therapy definitely does not help disc related pain. pain management will help your problem. local/epidural injections can be helpful. spinal cord stimulator as i described can be done in chronic musculoskeletal pain cases. hope this is helpful. i would be happy to answer any questions you may have.

by age is 37 and i got conceived . now am in 8th week . doctor suggested naturogest sr200 once in the night and i started bleeding for 1/2 day . scan says baby is ok. doc suggested to take naturogest twice . and it started bleeding whole day . now its 1 week over but the bleeding didst stop . am afraid if the baby is growing if all the blood is being discharged all through the day.is it safe to use naturogest ? now the bleeding can be controlled ? am much worried . please reply asap .,1,16737,"hallow dear, brown vaginal bleeding is old bleeding which remains inside for few days and then comes out. when it is of substantial amount, we suspect risk to the life of the baby. however, the bleeding was trivial and after such bleeding, you have been examined in the hospital and sent home with assurance. so no need to worry about the baby. it is likely that the mouth of the uterus (cervix) has started preparing for the delivery by getting gradually merged into the uterine walls. this process known as effacement of the cervix causes dislodgement of the mucous plug in the cervical canal with some bleeding. when such blood stained mucous come out immediately, it is red, however if it remains inside the vagina (due to very little amount or position) or cervix, the blood and thus the discharge becomes brown. however, 36 weeks is too early for starting labor process. so i would advise you to have complete rest in the house in a view to postpone the starting of labor pains as far as possible, at least for one week more. it would be good practice to monitor the well-being of the baby by listening to heart sounds (if you can do that) and/or counting the movements of the baby by clock. in left side position lying, in two hours, 10 movements are perceivable. if you note fetal movements getting affected, please report to the obstetrician asap. i hope this helps you."

"hello , a am a male 5 10 185lbs , not in grate shape but generally healthy . a just noticed a few minutes ago a visible limp on the side or my right shin.it is about the size of a beer bottle cap . there is no pain . this part of the skin does appear to be lighter than the rest . it is soft to touch and if pressed it goes away like if you press around it you feel muscle but right where it is you can sorta depress it more . any thoughts ? thanks",1,91109,". i read your question carefully, and i understand your concern. from the information you gave, the first thing i suspect is muscle strain. the suspicion for this condition is even higher after you have done examination, even a ct scan. regarding the amoxicillin therapy, it is an antibiotic and i can't find a reason for taking that, but for sure the doctor that prescribed it had a reason for that. i do have some questions though. is the pain localized in you abdomen or between the lower ribs in your right side. the pain is steady, or it begins or worsens with movement? do you have any swelling or bruising? is it tender when you touch it? if it is more localized between your ribs, it gets worse with movements or sneezing or deep breathing, it might be tender when you touch it than probably it is just muscle strain (as i said you excluded major conditions with examination. besides this, the condition how it started (stretching too much to get something) and an acute onset, all lead to muscle strain. in general, muscle sprain can be treated with rice therapy - rest, ice application, compress and exercise. to alleviate the pain you could take pain medication like ibuprofen or naproxen. it is necessary to limit the movement of the torso (rest, but just the firs days). gentle stretching exercises can help strengthen the muscles. pain can be alleviated applying an ice pack for 15-20 minutes 2-3 times a day (ice should not be in direct contact with the skin). for a full recovery it can take 4-6 weeks. feel free for additional questions. i hope the answer helped you. best regards"

i . a took my husband to the of earlier today due to an infection at the sight of an incision . this incision is umbilical and is due to an laparoscopic removal of his gall bladder . the infection is not inside the fascia but was bad enough they reopened the incision ( surgery was performed sept. 14th ) today to drain and clean it and then packed it . now he is in a great deal of pain at the site and tylenol and oxycodone are not doing the trick to stop it . should we return to the of ?,1,38498,"hi, how are you? my name is chat doctor. i am a surgical gastroenterologist and i hope to answer your question today. i am sorry to hear about your pain. i am sure that you have undergone a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. this usually involves making an incision below the belly button to insert the camera. this usually ends up being the biggest incision of the 3/4 incisions made to remove the gall bladder. normally, this incision is closed using suture material after the surgery is over to prevent a hernia through the incision. sometimes, some surgeons leave it open, especially if the incision was a small one. the pain and bruising you talk about could be one of two things. you might be feeling the ""knot"" of the suture material which was used to close the incision (rare if absorbable suture was used, a definite possibility if non-absorbable sutures was used) or it could be a small bit of ""momentum"" which has herniated through the incision. a simple ultrasonography scan of the belly will make the problem clear, so you can manage it appropriately. hope this helps and hope you start to feel better. please do not hesitate to write back for clarificationshave a great day"

"i , a got pregnant with the iud in site , a had it removed as soon as the blood test showed positive . a had a tear blood test and the numbers doubled from 640 to 1440 . a had my first ultrasound last week , and it showed a baby sac , and good heartbeat , but also evidence of retro-decidual collection in front of the sac about 1.5 cd . the cervical canal is closed , and i experienced no bleeding except for a light brownish discharge only once after intercourse . a don to know what does that mean , and should a take any medications ? because a actually feel it a better to leave things as they are without the interference of medication . pm a right or is my case really risky and need medication ? also should a quit my job and stay home at nearest ? a am 7 weeks pregnant now",1,79212,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. so, if you had a positive pregnancy test and did the test correctly, you should be pregnant. however, if there is no gestational sac visible on the ultrasound there are a few possibilities of what may be going on. first, the pregnancy may just be too small and early to see on an ultrasound. that can be normal if your period is only a week late. secondly, the pregnancy may not be growing a fetus, which is a kind of miscarriage (called a ""chemical pregnancy"") that gives you a positive test without development of a fetus. most people with this condition will eventually start bleeding and pass the pregnancy. the third possibility, which is the most concerning, is that your pregnancy is located outside your uterus. this is called an ectopic pregnancy. the most common site for an ectopic pregnancy is in the fallopian tube. the problem with a tubal pregnancy is that, as the fetus grows, the tube is not designed to expand, and it actually can burst, resulting in severe internal bleeding and even a risk of death for the mother. because of this, it is extremely important that you be closely followed by a physician for the early part of your pregnancy. you first need a blood level of your pregnancy hormone taken and then repeated along with another ultrasound in a few days. the hormone level should double every 48 hours in a normal pregnancy, and furthermore, if the hormone level is high and there is no visible intrauterine pregnancy then it is very suspicious for a tubal pregnancy. signs and symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy include spotting, abdominal pain (especially if it is only on one side), and sometimes right shoulder pain. dizziness, shortness of breath and fast heartbeat may indicate internal bleeding. if you have any of these symptoms, you should go to an emergency room for evaluation or call an ambulance. so in summary-when you have a positive pregnancy test with an ultrasound that does not show an intrauterine pregnancy, you need to be ruled out for an ectopic pregnancy. a blood pregnancy hormone level (called a bchatdoctor) should be done first, and depending on the result your doctor will be able to determine what is going on with your pregnancy and determine the best course of action. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

hello -- 2 weeks ago a suddenly felt like a was walking on a pebble after a removed my shoes at home . by yesterday a could see the bump on the bottom of my foot almost in the middle of the ball . a friend at the market today told me it a a bone spur ; he recognized the symptoms as he just had surgery for the same thing . a have no insurance right now and was planning to return to work very soon -- don to know what to do .,1,76948,"hi. thanks for a nice question and appreciation towards the newer techniques. there is a great, huge difference in abdominal hysterectomy 30 years ago and now. i hope you had a radical hysterectomy by laparoscopy or robotic technique. in hysterectomy the uterus and the ovaries are removed. side effects: due to surgical trauma-pain, bleeding, infection. due to anesthesia: backache and headache if spinal anesthesia was given. in general anesthesia, vomiting, late coming out of anesthesia, giddiness due to chat doctor. the difference has been possible due to various reason:*better anesthesia*better techniques-now laparoscopy and robotic surgery has made it possible to have very small incisions in millimeters and the recovery is fast. patient can walk on the same day or the nest day and goes home on 2nd or 3rd day.* these techniques also are almost bloodless. the blood loss is very minimal* the least tissue trauma, so fast recovery, almost no post-operative pain.* better medicines for pain management, better antibiotics.*training = due to the advent of internet, the world is one, a doctor can get training sitting at his home / hospital. he can attend seminars and workshops all over the world and learn the most advanced techniques. a new breed of surgeons s always ready to teach everyone who is interest.* patients understanding is equally important. today's patients know a lot more, she/he understands more and co-operates more. increases faith has a direct benefit on early healing of any problem."

(is usually significant for levels above 1)a more possible cause in your case may be a systemic disease such as dermatological disease or infection. eventhough, what to do next ? if i were your doctor, i should advise you to check d-dimer level in blood after 1 week. hope this is helpful. let me know if you need more clarifications. otherwise, please close and rate the answer. kind"

"cancer in the spine now tested not to come from the breast broken vertebra also attacking the spine and yesterday had one ovarian removed the size of an orange there was no sign of any cancer in august this of very aggressive this has now being tested , but of not breast related",3,82366,"hello friend, thank you for posting your query through chat doctor. i am a homeopath answering your query and the answer which i am going to give you may contain several thoughts which may appear strange or new for you. this i say because homeopathy is a new system of medicine and is almost unheard by the majority of the population. therefore, due to the high influence of the conventional medicine the people at large are brainwashed to believe and act according to the health education given by them. coming back to the fibroadenoma of your left breast in the year 1979, you had a psychological conflict in the mind level. you are a sensitive individual and that is why your left breast was affected. it must have been related with your child chat doctor. the sensitivity is genetic, and you reacted to the conflict through the brain according to a genetic programming. mind-brain - organ affection resulted in the development of a lump in your left breast in 1979. you consulted your gynecologist, and he suggested that it may turn to become cancerous in future and so it is better to remove it, and you subdued to his suggestion. actually the lump in the breast was an attempt of the body to cure you, or it was the result of a self defense mechanism. since you had not resolved the conflict in the psychological level, the lump remained there without getting resolved. but the body kept the lump protected in a cyst with minimum amount of inflammation called chronic cystitis. by removing the fibroadenoma or chronic cystic mastitis, you were not cured, but your lump in the breast was removed. in 1995 also you are the same person, you are the same sensitive person, and you underwent another more serious psychological conflict and the same left breast was again affected in a more serious manner. instead of recognizing the mass as a defense mechanism, you got the fear in you that you have cancer. the tissue changes also suggested that there is more serious pathology, and they labelled your lump this time as cancer and suggested removal of your left breast. if you could have recognized the lump as a defense mechanism and if you had no fear of cancer, you could have retained your breast. but the fear of cancer is such that it is associated with death and so you lost your breast. in no case, either by removal of lump in 1979 or by removal of your breast in 1995, you are not cured only your disease is cured. hope by this time you have got the answer for your query. both are related to each other because they are in the same individual, same sensitivity, same program. homeopathy cures the person and once the individual is cured all his diseases will be cured. with best wishes,"

i am suffering from back pain for the last 8 yrs the last year the pain is getting worser i have been going to physiotherapy no good i have had 4 sessions of acupuncture no good i have been now referred to hydrotherapy for 8 weeks what i wont to know is if my doctor can refer me to a sauna for my back pain . one more thing how deep is the water for hydrotherapy because i can not swim . i have been diagnosed with chronic back pain could you explain in detail what that means my physiotherapy says that i facet joint syndrome nerve root irritation,1,56450,"hello, sorry to hear that our team in the medical was not able to help you out. it would have been perfect if you had mentioned the details of the mri reports as we could have understood something from it. if you have any issue with the intervertebral disc and nerve entrapment. now since you are mentioning pain in the hip, thigh, leg and back, i would like to know if the pain symptom is radiating in nature? also, how is the back pain? is the nature of the pain sharp shooting or dull aching. if dull aching then it will be related to muscle but if sharpshooting than it will be for nerve. now coming to an analysis of you, you mentioned your age is 38, so we can look for some degenerative changes in the lumbar spine. due to which there might be changes of back pain and nerve getting trapped. for this i will recommend you to try out the exercise for the core, back and lower limbs on both sides. it is mandatory to do exercise in any back pains or radiating pains as due to pain there is a muscle weakness which gets build up over a period of time and once the muscles are weak there is instability of the spinal column. i wish you check for your blood glucose levels along with uric acid too, so we can have a differential diagnosis made to rule out the possibility because. if you can still mention in detail about the mri it will be really kind of you. in my clinical practice of over 12 years, many back cases associated with leg pain are doing well with conservative management. like - exercise, physical therapy and yoga. outcome score is almost as desired to be. please start the exercise, and you will get a difference in the overall physical well-being. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further. take care jay in chat doctor."
i am suffering from back pain for the last 8 yrs the last year the pain is getting worser i have been going to physiotherapy no good i have had 4 sessions of acupuncture no good i have been now referred to hydrotherapy for 8 weeks what i wont to know is if my doctor can refer me to a sauna for my back pain . one more thing how deep is the water for hydrotherapy because i can not swim . i have been diagnosed with chronic back pain could you explain in detail what that means my physiotherapy says that i facet joint syndrome nerve root irritation,2,57758,"hi, in your case, there are few information that would be very helpful for me (if you have provided): - do you have a low back pain (i assume not)- do you have a paresthesia in the legs or feet-did you have a history of any trauma to low back or gluteal area?- did you have a history of any intramuscular injection before the symptoms?- for how long do you have these problems? please provide these answers to any doctor that you seek his/her advice in the future. overall, based on the provided information, a thigh pain referring to the bottom of the leg most commonly originates from a nerve, a muscle or joint. i summarize them here: 1- nerve: it is possible that you have a disk protrusion at a low back area. sometimes a protruded disk induces pressure to the adjacent nerve and causes thigh pain. in some cases there is no low back pain. also, if the sciatic nerve is irritated by any cause, it causes the same problem (this is a rare cause).2- muscle: a tight muscle area (trigger point) in some gluteal and thigh areas can cause posterior thigh pain with radiation to the leg. 3- joint: there are small joints above and below any vertebral bone. we call them facet joint. if the facet joint of the l5 vertebra (the fifth vertebra) is irritated or damaged by any cause, it can cause thigh pain, which is sometimes not accompanied by a low back pain. in conclusion, if your problem is for only a few days you can take a 3-5 day course of an anti-inflammatory medication (such as ibuprofen, diclofenac, ...) and an anti-spasm medication (such as baclofen), (certainly if you don't have any contraindication to use them. if you have the problem for more than 2 weeks you should be visited by a physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist, orthopedist, or rheumatologist for a more accurate diagnosis. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"hello sir , i am having a lot of pain in the section of my upper right grinding teeth . the pain has now started spreading towards the centre teeth as well . i have consulted a dentist and he examined me with no cavity . he said my wisdom tooth are coming crooked . what shall i do ?",1,30317,"hi. thanks for the query. it looks like you have traumatic ulcers due to rubbing of the wisdom teeth. many a time the wisdom teeth are buccal erupted that is towards the cheek, and it causes biting of the cheek unintentionally causing painful ulcers. so my suggestion is to consult a dentist and get evaluated and if the wisdom teeth are causing ulcers then he can smoothen the cusps of the wisdom teeth and if they still cause cheek bite then extraction of the wisdom teeth can help in permanent resolution. if the problem is due to grinding of teeth then wearing mouth guards can help. hope this helps. regards."

(serum ferritin measure iron stores)from these tests, your doctor will be able to tell if you are truly iron deficient. iron supplements vary based on the amount of elemental iron they have in them. the more iron, the stronger the effect and the stronger the side effects (constipation etc.). if you have multiple allergies i would go for a pharmaceutical iron preparation as opposed to a ""natural"" iron remedy. one last thing - the weight loss is pretty severe and it's hard to blame allergies or iron deficiency. make sure you doctor checks this out fully."

i am having spotting its just like regular blood . but light in color around the time my period was supposed to be it was off and on for 2 weeks but the same light pink coloured blood . i don to have any other symptoms of pregnancy except being tired and food cravings . i am worried . could i be pregnant ? or could there be something else wrong ?,1,33580,"hello dear, i understand your concern. in my opinion there is no chance for pregnancy to occur 6 weeks after intercourse. once you get the period there is no chance of pregnancy unless you have unprotected intercourse after the periods. as nothing such happened and the last intercourse was done only on november 14th after which you got the periods the chances of pregnancy are very rare. but just as a benefit of doubt a urine pregnancy test can be done to rule out the pregnancy. it will be positive from one week after the missed period in case of pregnancy. and by 3 months of pregnancy physical examination also helps in diagnosis. i suggest you to consult doctor for further work up. if there was any pregnancy the symptoms like nausea, vomitings, increased urination, sore breasts would be present as all the symptoms start around 6 weeks. but overall the pregnancy appears to be rare or nil possibility because you got the periods and you don't have any symptoms of pregnancy. so relax. avoid stress. the delay could be due to hormonal imbalance as the birth control pills were stopped. avoid stress as it also delays the period. hope this helps. best regards.,"

"i , my tongue has been very sore for 4 days now . it hurts to eat , spit , swallow ... everything . it seems like there is a sore underneath in the back , but i done see anything but redness . why is this and is there anything over the counter that can help me ease the pain ?",3,13930,"hello, and thank you for your question. fortunately, you probably do not have fibromyalgia. there are several possible causes of pain just in the toe. if there is a pinched nerve in the lower spine, it can cause pain that can be just in one toe. if this is the case, you may find that the pain is worse with change in position, such as lying flat or standing up. pain in the toe, typically the big toe, is common in a disorder called gout, in which the body has too much uric acid. the pain usually lasts a few days at a time, and is usually associated with redness and swelling. pain in the toes can be caused by corns or other skin problems that look small but feel very severe. pins and needles, shooting, on-and-off pains can be caused by irritation to a nerve by diabetes, by lack of vitamins such as b12, or by pressure - similar to the ""foot falling asleep"" feeling we sometimes get if we cross our legs too long. fibromyalgia, on the other hand, is usually a ""pain all over"" problem - back pain, neck pain, arm pain, knee pain, without another cause such as arthritis. it usually does not cause just one part of the body to hurt - most patients say that ""everything hurts"". in my practice, i start with finding out as much as i can from the patient about how the pain feels and how long it has been going on, and if it seems related to anything else. then we examine the foot to look for anything going on with the skin, check if the nerves of the foot are normally sensitive, not as sensitive as usual, or more sensitive, and then we may check blood tests to detect diabetes or vitamin deficiency or other problems as needed. fibromyalgia is diagnosed by obtaining a careful history of where the patient is having pain, other medical problems, and completing a physical exam including what is called a ""painful point"" exam where the doctor pushes at certain places in the body - on the back and near the joints - to see if this causes pain. i hope that my answer to your question is helpful. if you have any further questions, please check back with us. i hope your toe is much better soon."

"a am trying to understand what is meant by - right upper lobe 5 my non-calcified nodule and suggestion of a vague subcentimeter satellite nodule versus focal inflammation or fibrosis ; although the nodule may be inflammatory/granulomatous , a pulmonary metastasis or early primary neoplasm the result of a baseline of study following chemotherapy after surgery for ovarian cancer .",1,35690,"it means a 5 mm lesion (shadow) seen on the ct scan in right lung in its upper lobe (right lung has three lobes: upper, middle and lower). since the nodule size is very small 5 mm (half of a centimeter), the radiologist has not been able to give an exact diagnosis, and he has given a differential diagnosis (meaning it can be one of the following) of the following:1. inflammatory/granulators lesion: secondary to infection or foreign body etc2. pulmonary metastasis: metastatic disease to lungs is a possibility since you have a primary ovarian cancer3. early primary neoplasm: a primary lung cancer in its very early stages because of the small size. since the size of the lesion is very small, a biopsy would not be possible to confirm the diagnosis. i would suggest a repeat ct scan after 2 months to see if the nodule size has increased. if the size remains stable, it's likely to be benign. if it increases to > 1 cm, a pet scan or a biopsy can be done. i hope i have answered your query. i would be more than happy to answer if you have any further queries."

"a took 2 doses of next choice within 4 weeks of each other , one at the end of november and one at the end of december . a did not get a period until january 17th and it was pretty normal , then my period in february came early and lasted for a week , now it is march and a am late for my period . is it normal for this medicine to do this to you ?",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"a recently finished my birth control pack ( the active days ) . a never take the last week because there just placebos , and i usually get my period 3 days after i stop the active pills . so say fridays my last active day then by monday usually . now its thursday and nothing . ave have cramping , and today just some spotting . is it normal to skip periods while on the birth control pill ? so far ( for a year ) its been pretty consistent .",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

hello ........ i am 23 years old .... lately i am facing severe pain in my lower abdomen ........ as my masturbation is not regular .... i have been taking medicines for it .......... although i was told to consume it in very little amounts ... this pain only stops if i participate in a sexual activity .... this problem raised for past 7 to 8 months ..... and it happens every month,1,67649,"hello! i read carefully your query and understand your concern. if this pain happens only once in a while it might due to constipation, if it happens near your menstruation time it might due to that, or it might be a muscular pain. you don't need to worry because if the pain was caused by a serious condition it would be there all time and would be accompanied by other symptoms. usually pancreatitis cause a severe pain in upper abdomen that irradiate in the back, nausea,vomits and a very sensitive abdomen when you touch it. so i don't think it is pancreatitis. if the pain get worse, or lasts for some days, and you have other symptoms such as fever, vomits,diarrhea then i should consult a physician for diagnosis and treatment.meanwhile, you can use ibuprofen and tuscan to relieve this pain. hope my answer has helped. take care. chat doctor."

good day . a a 34 years old and have found a lump as small as a bead at the tail ( bottom ) of the epididymis . not painless and is separate from the tentacle . it feels like if it is attached by a very short vein to the edidimytis on my left testes . that can this be . to a need to be worried and can it be dangerous . a have made an appointment with the urologist however he can only see me on 23 february 2017 .,1,35811,"dear user, thanks for your question. there may be a few possibilities1 epididymis cyst. these are the small cysts (fluid-filled sacs) that can appear in the epididymis, usually cause no discomfort or pain. usually, the doctor can diagnose it clinically, but sometimes an ultrasound may be needed to confirm the cyst. they are left alone if not infected, very big (which need needle aspiration of fluid in it), or painful. rarely they may need removal by operation if causing suspicion or trouble.2 spermatocyte: this is a cyst which feels like an epididymis cyst, but it is filled with sperm (semen). again managed conservatively most of the time.3 varicocele: this is like varicose veins of the small veins next to one testicle (testis) or both testes. it is usually described as feeling as a wriggling bag of worms. this is managed with surgery mostly, after preliminary investigations to see what's causing pressure on the testicular veins. 4 lipoma: this is a fatty lump which can sometimes cause difficulty because it can be felt separate from the testis, just like an epididymis cyst. so i suggest if it is soft and doesn't increase in size, you can wait for the appointment. just keep an eye on it. do write back if there are any more concerns. thanks"

(would you be having it then?) now your cycle is of 30 days period. so the expected date of ovulation should be 07 january. hence, if the conception takes place on 07 january, the due date of delivery would be 30 september. the hitch here is that you should have ovulation taking lace on 07 january. moreover, we have noticed that all the pregnancies do not last for 280 days. the delivery can take place any time between 3 weeks earlier to 1 week later than the expected due date of delivery. keeping these facts and calculations in mind, you may plan your sexual relations accordingly. i hope this will help you."

a have excess saliva forming in my mouth for past 3 nights in the evenings also a have sharp pains in my chest and at the back in the middle of the spine feeling bit weak and dizzy today and whilst walking this chest pain causes me to hold/ press firmly in my chest to release the pain a am going through a bit of a stressful period at the moment with family & work,1,41649,"hello. thank you for your question and welcome to chat doctor. i understand your concern. well, i am going to try and explain the differences between various origins of the pain which can arise from the rib cage. there is angina. it is described more like mid-chest heaviness or squeezing sensation, that is triggered by exercise and relieved by rest, which radiates to the both sides of the chest, to the jaw and left arm and shoulder. it is indicative of a blockage within one or more coronary arteries and reflects the lowering of blood supply to the heart muscle. an ekg obtained in the moment of chest pain, if it fills this description, would be helpful. then there is pleuritic chest pain. this kind of pain is sharp, stabbing pain that can happen in any part of the chest area. no radiation like in anginal pain. it arises from acute or chronic inflammation of the linings that are within the rib cage: pleura (lining of the lungs) or pericardium (lining of the heart) or both. in this regard, i would recommend a chest x-ray for pleural inflammation or effusion. in case of pericardial pain and anginal pain, echocardiogram is helpful, by evaluating the size, motility and function of heart muscle and valves, and also by assessing the pericardium and whether there is fluid build-up within it, or not. other causes of chest pain are related to the locomotion system of the rib cage: muscle soreness, bone and cartilage-related pain. in the end, stress can also cause chest pain. i hope i was helpful with my answer. best regards,"

"i , a have dry sex with my girlfriend we both had our clothes on , me with my underwear and my jeans and her with her underwear and jeans . a ejaculated inside my pants and got wet , a done know if she got her pants wet . that are the chances that she is pregnant ? , pm young and a a very afraid . a would appreciate your answer . thanks",1,102839,"hi, i guess your concern is about getting pregnant of your girlfriend from pre-ejaculatory liquid near vagina. so my straight forward answer is, yes. there are chances but it's very, very less to getting her pregnant. usually chances of getting pregnant is more when ejaculation occurs when penis is inside the vagina. but in your case as you told that your penis did not go inside the vagina, and you were just rubbing it against her outer vagina. so there is very, very less chance of getting pregnant. so don't worry, relax. you also told that u didn't have condom on that time. and there is pre-ejaculation occurs around her vagina. so there is little chances having for getting pregnant. for that you do not need to take tension because your girlfriend can use emergency contraceptive pill (i-pill) within 72 hrs of unprotected intercourse. as told by you that you people had intercourse 2 days ago. so there is sufficient time to take emergency contraception. this is usually available your nearby medical store at affordable prices. with this above discussion you can try out my suggestions-1. don't waste time and get the i-pill as early as possible. ask your girlfriend to take it. wait till her next menses. if she gets menses on her expected or delay date, she will not be pregnant. 2. you can do urinary pregnancy test after 5-6 days of her missed period. it is available at affordable prices your nearby medical store. buy it and ask your girlfriend to do it by herself. if it is negative, she's not pregnant. if it is positive visit to nearby gynecologist for further help. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further. chat doctor."

"hi doctor . in raven i have a question for a that may wife has both ovarian cyst and that was removed by surgery left ovarian cyst before 30 month and right ovarian cyst was removed before 16 month , at that her doctor said to plan for pregnancy after 6 month but we are trying to get baby but my wife in to getting pregnant till now . how can she get pregnant ? we are taking physical relation ship almost daily but also she in to getting pregnant ? and before 36 month she was pregnant and we abort that at 5 weeks . ply suggest us ...",1,97281,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. many women accidentally ingest medications or alcohol before they find out that they are pregnant. however, there is no fetus that even develops before the 7th week or so, so the effects of medications on a developing fetus would not yet be able to pose any harm to the pregnancy. furthermore, there are only a few, very strong iv antibiotics that can actually cause significant harm to a developing fetus. so it is unlikely that the antibiotic that your wife was taking was even unsafe during pregnancy. asking whether a woman is pregnant when prescribing medication is a common routine practice and does not mean that the medication prescribed is in any way. so in summary, i do not think you need to be worried about the medication your wife took in this very early stage. to enhance the health of her pregnancy, she should follow a well-balanced diet, avoid alcohol, and begin to take a vitamin supplement designed for pregnant women. your should also choose a prenatal care provider for her and have your first visit about a month from now. i hope i was able to adequate;y answer your question today, and that my advice was reassuring. best wishes,"

(regular use of emergency pill is harmful)conception occurs if she was in 10th to 18th day of her cycle(in a regular cycle of 28 day duration). you can ask her at what day she is in and wait for next cycle to occur. if it delayed by 7 days then get done upt to diagnose if pregnant and then the required treatment can be taken. regards"

"goodmorning , my name is austin . a am 29 , in fairly good physical shape , eat plenty , drink lots of fluids but my problem is that over the last couple weeks i have had headaches that feel like pressure pushing outward from inside my head . some are worse than others but i have no sinus problems and these feel nothing like a migraine . home are only 30 min but some last hours on end . it is not affected by light , sound , stress , whether or not i eat or anything . by by is in good range so i just dismiss them as headaches . when today i got home from work and went to the restroom and while i was in there i lost all vision , mobility , sound , thought , everything . a heard myself breathing but it sounded like i was breathing into a fan or machine and like my head was being shook real fast from side to side . it lasted maybe 5 secs and i was back . now i am a bit shaky all over and my head is pounding . should i be worried ? ? ?",1,73387,"hi there! my name is vinay. let me see if i can give you some peace of mind here. mris all depend on magnets! no radiation and they are pretty harmless. the only thing you have to make sure is that you have no implants that could be attracted by the magnet in the machine. when i was in residency in colorado, the duty doc room used to be taken up by my chief and his girlfriend. so i used to sleep in the mri machine!! it was the only flat surface other than the gurneys in the er. so don't worry, the mri is harmless. now the scar tissue at the operative site should not be causing any headaches as its not under pressure and brain tissue can't feel normal sensations like pain. if you are having headaches. look into any problems with the scalp wound or the bone (skull) that they had to go through during the surgery. scar tissue can hypertrophy (grow in size) over time, but its really rare and really, really slow. so the mris will catch it if it does. not to worry there. so relax, the scar tissue is harmless and so is the mri. make sure you get those scans done just as the doctors tell you too! congratulations on beating back the gbm! i wish you the best of luck!"

"be are trying to conceive last ovulation was 3 weeks ago i had a very light period that only lasted at day/day and half . a usually have tender breasts about a week before my period but they are still tender now , last week i suffered from quite a few headaches and for the last 2 days i have been feeling nauseous on and off all the time . is it too early to do a pregnancy test ?",1,10535,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. pregnacare conception is simply a combination of vitamins that help a woman have a healthy pregnancy from conception. it has no hormonal effects and should not have any impact on the regularity of your cycle nor your ability to conceive, it is not unusual for women to bleed on and off for even 6 weeks after a miscarriage so the 19-day bleeding episode you had may not have actually been a menstrual period but still could have been bleeding leftover for your d and c. so you may not be ""late"" at all, but may just have not had a real period since the pregnancy. there is no reason to assume you would have problems getting pregnant again since you have conceived naturally twice in the last year. either way, the pregnancies conception vitamins have nothing to do with your irregular bleeding. it is generally advisable to wait to try to conceive again after your first real period-so i would wait until you bleed again to resume trying to conceive. if you do not get a real period by 3 months from your last bleeding episode, you should follow up for your gun for a re-evaluation of your hormones and treatment with progesterone, which can restart your period cycling. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful. best wishes,"

my friends younger brother is showing some symptoms of schizophrenia .. he is just 15 .. is it possible at such an found age ? ? what should we do ? ? .. his current doctor 1st said that he had ocd .. but now hes not sure of the case anymore .. could you kindly suggest something,1,104085,"! jacky i really appreciate your efforts for the treatment for your son, and you are not overreacting at all. from what you have said in question i can say from my clinical experience that your son is having some autistic features (as he strictly follows the same routine and throws tantrums when routine is changed). his mood swings might be related to such events as i can guess otherwise he would talk to you normally. you have not mentioned so, but such people are also strict about their dietary habits and may go to extremes patterns to follow it. the point which is against autism is that he developed this pattern just a year back and not from childhood. such features are also seen in a condition called ocd. you have said that he looks depressed, which can be seen in ocd (comorbid depression). you have mentioned mood fluctuations in which one side is that -- he gets angry and yells and screams, but the other side is not reflective of manic features, so, i donor think that he is bipolar. however, making a correct diagnosis the psychiatrist must interview the patient herself. one thing is definite that your son needs help and i'm sure that medicines will help him a lot, more than you may even think of. so, i would suggest that you must make a visit to a psychiatrist with him. when medicine will start showing effect his diet will also improve apart from his behavior, this will help in managing diabetes as well. you have asked if these symptoms are related to diabetes or not. well, i have not gone across any such research work till now where diabetes itself is a cause for such symptoms in any patient. so, it looks unlikely to be so. as you have mentioned that he had a breakup, which can be taken as a stressor, i think it might be related to his current condition to some extent. hope the reply is useful for feel free to ask more questions"

by child who is 20 months old is have loose motion like stool from last 20 days .. today done a stool routine test however still a have to collect the reports . please tell me is it due to he still gets the mother feeding that is why he is doing or due to infection,1,70703,your child could have got a gastrointestinal infection which is the likely cause of his loose motion. it is also possible that he is still not used to the new kind of food and hence the passage of loose stools. the bubbles are due to bacterial degradation of undigested food in the intestines and hence support this fact. let me assure you that the child can pass stool after every feed due to a phenomenon called gastronomic reflex which is absolutely normal and there is nothing to be worried about. zinconia or zinc supplements help in the repair of the thin inner lining of the intestines (intestinal epithelium) which gets damaged during episodes of loose stools and hence needs to be given for a few days. enterogermina contains beneficial bacteria that reside in our intestines and may help in controlling the loose stools.

"a have torn the frenulum under my tongue through pulling of my tongue , a heard it snap . a only did it yesterday and it did to bleed much but is sore today and a can see that is is torn . to a need to see a dentist or should it heal by itself ? thank you .",1,16472,"hi. welcome to chat doctor . as per your complaint ankyloglossia or tongue tie is a condition in which the attachment of the tongue to the floor of mouth is a bit longer due to a longer lingual frenulum [fold of mucosa under the tongue that attaches the tongue to floor of mouth]. when it is long it attaches the tongue and restricts its movement that is needed to speak a certain word. but a good part is that it can be very well improved with treatment, and you can get frenulectomy done in which the excess attachment will be reduced, and the tongue will become free that will help in easing in speech. it is a minor surgical procedure, so you need not worry and should get it done soon so that your son can speak well and at this age it will not require extensive speech therapy if treated. hope this helps. regards."
