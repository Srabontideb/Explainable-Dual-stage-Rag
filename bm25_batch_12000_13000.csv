i have pneumonia i have been home from hospital for two days still recovering from a broken hip and pelvis but now i have this too in getting pins and needles in my upper back and shoulders mixed with a numbness sometimes or something running down my back is it any thing to worry about ply help,1,36160,hi. thanks for your query and an elucidated history. the lump at the back of the neck can not cause a direct problem of pins and needles in the arm. it is possible that the muscle spasm caused by this lump can indirectly cause nerve pressure or pinching. get fnac done of the lump and the mri should have been done to see if there is a protruding disc causing pressure on the spinal cord which causes the pins and needles feeling in the upper limb as you have. it is wise to get an opinion f a surgeon for the lump and of the neurologist for pins and needles sensation in the arm.

"hello , my name is michelle and in 46.the past couple of was or so , live experience tingling , electrical sensations up my right side of my neck.the last 3 days a pressure and ache began on my right side jawline.this resulted in a lump appearing and being noticeable yesterday , slightly less noticeable today , thankyou",1,5725,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. as your uterus grows, there are two ligaments that are located on either side of the graph the front wall of your uterus that anchor it to your pelvis. these are called the round ligaments and for some reason, many women experience pulling sensations and pain as these ligaments are stretched. the pain is usually associated with walking or standing, and for an unknown reason, is more likely to occur on the right side. we refer to that type of pain in obstetrics as round ligament pain. it usually begins in the mid-second trimester and can occur into the early third trimester. it is nothing to worry about and will usually go away when you rest or chat doctor. if you experience any vaginal bleeding, or leakage of watery fluid from the vagina, or regular painful abdominal pains that seem to come and go with the clock and feel like menstrual cramps, you should instead report to labor and delivery for further evaluation. in the meantime however the right-sided pain you describe is likely a normal part of pregnancy, and really is nothing to worry about. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was reassuring. best wishes, and best of luck for the rest of the pregnancy,"

"i doctor , case ( email patient ) : bleeding through removal of * 5-6 for six days , blood vomit for 5 to 6 times on the day of admit ( in castro department ) . never for last 10 days . to jaundice in past.pr-100/min , bp-110/70mn of of , rp-20/mincvs-s1s2chest-b/l clearcns- nr/ks - ntb/l - clearaccording to doctors , the liver is damaged fully.my question : an the liver be recovered , of yes , how and what precaution should be taken ( i.e . diet , health , etc )",1,5256,"hi, how are you? my name is chat doctor. thanks for writing to chat doctor and i hope to answer your question today. hepatitis c virus, as i am sure you are aware, damages the liver cells. the liver has an enormous capacity to regenerate, meaning if part of the liver is damaged, then new liver cells are formed to replace the damaged liver (unlike skin where damaged skin is replaced by scar). the problem with hepatitis c is, it is present constantly in the blood and liver and continues to damage the liver continuously. just like a rubber band can be stretched only so far before it snaps, so is the regenerative capacity of the liver. depending on how virulent the hepatitis c strain is, over the course of 10-30 yrs, the liver exhausts its capacity to regenerate and just like skin, the damaged liver cells starts getting replaced by scar tissue - this leads to hardening of the normal supple liver - a condition known as liver fibrosis which later on leads to liver cirrhosis. the problem with this is, under normal circumstances anywhere between 1200 and 1500 ml of blood flows through the liver per min. when the liver is normal and supple, this blood can flow easily through the liver. but when the liver begins to stiffen or harden as in the case of cirrhosis, this blood is met with great resistance during its flow through the liver. this is called as ""portal hypertension"". so the blood starts to look for alternate routes to return to the heart and the most accessible route for it is through the veins of the food pipe (esophagus and stomach). the problem with this is, the veins in the esophagus and stomach are very thin walled and are not used to carrying this much volume of blood. so they distend to a great degree (a condition called as varices) and sometime even rupture with catastrophic consequences. this is easily diagnosed by upper gi endoscopy where the largely dilated veins can be seen. but in your case, since multiple upper gi endoscopies have not demonstrated any varices, it means your liver has not reached a state of ""portal hypertension"" yet and the disease seems not be progressing or is ""stable"". if i was your doctor, i would also get a ""fibrosis"" which is a special scan of the liver to look at the amount of stiffness or hardening of the liver. this can be repeated regularly to see the progression of the fibrosis. i would also explore the different treatments for hepatitis c infection. the gold standard is of course a liver biopsy which will demonstrate the exact status of your liver. i hope this helped, and i do hope you will get better soon. please write back to me if you need any further clarifications especially the treatment options available to treat hepatitis c. have a great day"

of this .",1,0,"hi, thank you for posting your query. the most likely cause for your symptoms is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (bppv), a type of peripheral vertigo. in this condition, the most common symptom is dizziness or giddiness, which is made worse with movements. accompanying nausea and vomiting are common. the condition is due to problem in the ear, and improves in a few days on own. betahistine tablets would help relieve your symptoms. doing vestibular rehabilitation or adaptation exercises would prevent the recurrence of these symptoms. an ent evaluation would also help. i hope it helps. best wishes, chat doctor."

release of certain substances from your blood, leading to itchy skin rash and swelling over soft tissues. its proper management requires thorough history, clinical and laboratory work-up. you may have to go for specific tests like patch test, food prick test, ige antibody levels etc. as for treatment part, best would be the avoidance of allergen as far as possible. try to eliminate possible triggering foods from diet. i would also advise you various antihistamines for long duration(at least 3 months) with or without oral corticosteroids. for non-responding cases there are many other chat

"hello doc , a want to consult regarding my mother a health . the has suffered 2 times with pancreas infection and we managed to control the effect with help of medical assistance . is told this could be due to stones in gall bladder , but we got ultrasound and found none . a am concerned of the cause of the this infection . be live in kanpur and can be available if needed for any check up .",1,108867,"hello mr mayan, i am so sorry to hear regarding your condition. stones in the pancreas head are not very common, but do cause a lot of problems including pain, poor absorption and malnutrition and can also lead to diabetes due to pancreatic failure. there are two ways of dealing with the stone, based on how close it is to the pancreatic duct opening. if it is close to the opening, then it could potentially be treated with endoscopic technique (ercp). if however the stone is big, then it will necessitate surgery to remove the stone. there are two cmc s in india. nellore in the south and ludhiana in the north (where dayan and medical college is also located). if needed i can put you in touch with the gastroenterologist in cmc, ludhiana. regarding the cost of the procedure, if it can be done endoscopically, then i would assume a total expenditure of about 35-50 thousand rupees (including the necessary scans). if surgery is required, then the cost could be around 1.5-2 lakhs. hope this helps, and please do not hesitate to contact me for any other details required."

"i , a have a lump on the right side of my neck , just beside my jaw curve and below my ear . it a been there for about 3 weeks , has not changed in size , and when a push on it moves but once pressure is released it returns to the original spot . by question is : is this something to get checked out ?",1,33931,"hi michele jacobi the first thing that has to be done once you find a lump in the region of the chest wall is to confirm what it is. in your case a biopsy has already been done and let us await its result. you're understanding that cancerous lumps don't bleed after biopsy is correct. but i think your presumption that if it was scar tissue it would have bled is not correct. scar tissue also need not bleed. needle biopsies do not usually cause any bleeding unless a blood vessel is ruptured during the procedure since how long have you noticed this lump. is the size of the lump increasing ? if the biopsy comes as positive for cancer then you will have to undergo a series of investigation to find out he the extent of the disease. ? whether it is confined to the chest wall only or whether it has gone beyond the chest wall to other regions. treatment decision will depend on the results of this if the biopsy comes as negative for cancer then there are 2 options 1- if your physician thinks it is insignificant then you need to follow it up. just keep a check on your lump to see whether it is increasing in size and also get it checked by your physician regularly2- the second option (and my preference) is to do an open biopsy especially if the lump was detected recently and is increasing in size and also if the lump is firm to hard (and not very soft). the reason is needle biopsy can be negative, but this does not always mean there is no cancer especially if the tissue sample taken is not adequate. also time factor is important. you may lose time keeping the lump under follow up to see whether it is increasing in size hope you are satisfied with my reply. anyway don't worry. follow your doctors' advice chat doctor."

"a started having a pain back in january after climbing stairs while carrying a book bag . the pain occurred upon sitting . it was a weird pressure that begin at the base of the back of my head and then travelled down my spinal column and into my hips . when it started it felt like pressure , but a minute or so later it had built into a strong severe pressing pain . it occurs off and on ( not every time a climb stairs , not always when lifting something ) and it happened again this morning right after a sat down in the car .",1,44020,"i'm sorry to hear about your pain and how it is affecting you physical activity. now hip pain can be tricky. many times patients feel they have hip pain when actually the pain is from the sacroiliac joint. to differentiate, first imagine where you would point to if someone asked you where the most pain occurs. if the pain is in the groin and worsened with walking, climbing stairs, getting in and out of the car or a seat, it is likely hip joint pain. if the pain is actually out to the side and above your buttocks (picture someone placing their hands on their ""hips""), it is likely sacroiliac joint pain. many times patients with sacroiliac joint pain can have symptoms radiate down the leg, while hip pain typically radiates into the groin and sometimes to the same sided knee. the best way to figure the problem out is to have a x-ray of your hip and also of your low back and sacroiliac joint. i hope this answer is helpful. in either case, the good news is that stretching, anti-inflammatory medications and even a joint injection can be very helpful. i hope you feel better and get out golfing again soon!"

(regular use of emergency pill is harmful)conception occurs if she was in 10th to 18th day of her cycle(in a regular cycle of 28 day duration). you can ask her at what day she is in and wait for next cycle to occur. if it delayed by 7 days then get done upt to diagnose if pregnant and then the required treatment can be taken. regards"
"of ! in 32 yrs old who has been etc for quite some time now . pm not sure if i have conceived now . a was actually expecting to get my periods yesterday , but i happened to take just 3 tablets of promilut n. pm worried that if in pregnant , will it affect my pregnancy ? ?",1,108096,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. it is true that theoretically you should have been clear of the injection within three months of discontinuation, however many women after being a depo-provera for a long time do not resume having ovulatory, regular, menstrual cycles until 6 to 9 months or even up to a year after discontinuation. unfortunately, it is difficult to artificially induce ovulation in women who are coming off depo-provera. if you were not trying to become pregnant, your cycle could be regulated temporarily with birth control pills, but if you're actually trying to get pregnant the best thing you can do with this point is to just keep trying and wait and see. if you feel any symptoms of pregnancy, and you haven't gotten your period for a while, i would do pregnancy test just to make sure. there is always a possibility even if your periods are not regular that you do ovulate sometimes. so in summary, continue having unprotected sex every other to every three days and give it some more time. 80% of couples will conceive within one year, and if after a year of trying you and your partner are unsuccessful, it might be a good idea to see a fertility specialist for an evaluation. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes, and good luck getting pregnant,"

i i am a 28 year old woman and have been suffering with constipation which has caused haemorrhoids . it is that bad that i have has to put my thumb inside my vagina to push the hard faeces down the wall between vagina and rectum . there i found quite a large bump which felt almost like a lump of muscle . please advise !,1,95340,"hi, i understand your concern and your problem. this may happen in the following scenarios. 1. the nova ring is broken; sometimes the joint of the ring is broken, so it may not regain back its desired shape once inside the vagina and slips out. in this case try a new ring.2. the vagina is lax and roomy. sometimes vaginal laxity may interfere with holding the ring in place, this is very rare and unless the vagina is too lax, it does not slip.3. ring not pushed far enough; sometimes women do not push it far enough inside so that it remains at the vaginal opening and slips out. the first and third are common likely causes. check to see if any of this is happening to you. if the ring is broken use a new one and use some other method like condom for next 7 days. if you are scared to push it in, i want to reassure you that don't be afraid. this ring is safe and will not go anywhere other than the vagina. it does not cause any trauma, so it is safe. just push it way inside, so it will not slip. the best position to do this is lying down and slowly pushing it inside towards your buttocks that is backwards. a tilted uterus will not affect the position of the ring and neither will it have any effect on its insertion. another word of caution is that if the ring has been lying outside for more than 3 hours, use another method like condom for the next seven days after correctly inserting the ring. hope i was able to help you, thank you for using chat doctor and have a nice day."

"i am a 28 year old mother of 2 . a am in good health . except for ballots in my gulbadder . but my biggest concern is that , i never feel hungry and when i eat or force myself to eat its not a lot . a can drink a meal and so i eat and never drink when eating . i am 5 7 and i used to weigh 130 lbs but now i weigh 113lbs . in at a loss . please help . tiffany",1,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

hi doctor i a having cod for the last 4 years . i have clear tubes and the problem is this my periods are regular and this month the egg size is 20mm on 12th day and the same is ruptured on 14th day . my husbands semen report is good . is there chance to become pregnant this time . i have no issue and history of one miscarriage 4 years ago,2,13108,"hi, i appreciate your query would clarify the report of your follicular study to you. on the 9th day, in the right and left ovaries (of and lof) - there was no df - which means, dominant follicle. again the same findings persisted till the 13th day, that is there was no dominant follicle in any of the ovaries. et - refers to endometrial thickness which was 8 mm on day 13. collection in pod was nil, which is normal. now, to explain a normal follicular study to you. by day 9, the ovaries start producing dominant follicles, that is among the many eggs present in the ovaries, one starts maturing to develop into the dominant egg for that month. by day 13 generally, if you have a regular 28-day menstrual cycle, the dominant egg reaches a size of 20 - 22 mm. generally on day 14, ovulation occurs, that is the mature dominant egg is released from the ovary, and it is then ready for fertilization by the sperm. this is the normal studyhowever, in your case, there is no dominant follicle seen till day 13, which means that you are having an ovulatory cycle. that is, no mature egg is developing for ovulation this month. anovulatory cycles are a major cause for not being able to conceive.pod (polycystic ovarian disease) is one of the leading causes of an ovulation, apart from other conditions. you need to consult a gynecologist, and undergo further investigations for pod to rule out the cause of this follicular study. also, you might require treatment and ovulation induction (medicines to stimulate formation of follicles in the ovary). in case your cycles are delayed (longer than 28 - 30 days), there is a minor possibility that your follicles are maturing later than normal, for e.g., in a 35-day cycle, the day of ovulation would be 14 days before periods, that is on day 20 or 21. hope this helped you."
hi doctor i a having cod for the last 4 years . i have clear tubes and the problem is this my periods are regular and this month the egg size is 20mm on 12th day and the same is ruptured on 14th day . my husbands semen report is good . is there chance to become pregnant this time . i have no issue and history of one miscarriage 4 years ago,3,17442,"dear madam, all the tests done on both of you are normal. by this statement, i presume that you are releasing the egg normally, your both the tubes are patent, the uterine lining is normal and there is no tumor or any abnormality in the uterus. also, that there is no infection in the vagina. furthermore i understand that the semen examination of your husband has revealed normal sperm count with normal motility. in such case, i would suggest you to go for ovulation monitoring. you will have to submit yourself for ultrasonography from day 9 onwards till the ovulation (egg release) takes place. usually the ovulation occurs when the follicle of the egg attains the size of 18 mm. utilize this day, a day before and after this. plan your sexual intercourse on these days. if there is no other abnormality, this should make you happy. if the ovulation takes place after the follicle attains more than 21 mm size, the chances of fertilization are very poor. may i suggest you one more test, if you have not done it already. please get the post-coital semen examination done. in this test, semen is collected from your vagina after the intercourse for microscopic examination. sometimes, the vagina contains antibodies or environment which is hostile to the sperms. in such cases, the sperms which were normal in semen examination, show dead or sluggish in this test. thus, this test reveals whether your intraluminal environment is hostile to your husbands semen or you have got antibodies against his sperms which is preventing factor for the fertilization. if it is so, you may ask me direct question by going to my profile and upload the reports for my review so that i can advise you some measures. i hope this much advice should give you some direction."

""what is wrong with me?"" etc. every time we assume a lying down position, our heart, that beats by vibrating our chest wall, comes closer to a certain area of the rib cage. if lying on the left side it is so close to the chest wall that can even vibrate the bed you are lying on. all the other symptoms you mentioned are triggered by the anxiety attack you have, because all types of anxieties have one thing in common: flush of a chat doctor."

"a have trigeminal neuralgia , a am trying to manage it as well as possible by taking amitripyline 10 my one or two at night before going to sleep and also iodine for the pain , today though a feel quite good , which is a change . cheers , frame",1,33499,"i suggest taking an x-ray of your finger and get it checked by orthopedic to rule out hair line crack. if there is crack then need to plaster it properly. and you should not move it for 3 weeks. if there is no crack and only soft tissue strain, without having any open wound i suggest to use cold pack. as well visit a physiotherapist for ultrasound therapy treatment which helps to heal soft tissue. this will take some more time to give relief but as you have told swelling is reduces and there was a skin color change at the time of injury and that is also reduced. and now you have only pain in fingertips means it is healing but taking some time. if there is no hairline crack then you can take some painkiller at night before you sleep and make sure you don't sleep on your affected finger. if one thing you have not mentioned is about pain, is it reducing, increasing, or the same.? at anytime you feel the pain is increasing then do contact orthopedic doctor because you may need anti-biotic medication also to prevent infection. take care"

"by girlfriend and a were fooling around on the 26th of june , then on the 14th of july she began spotting and finally got her period , she went through several pads but 2 days later it stopped then she began spotting then it stopped again and it came back and stopped again ... now when we were fooling around we were trying anal and a decided to wipe precut off of her butt , but a wiped back to front , what are the chances of her getting pregnant or being pregnant ?",1,102839,"hi, i guess your concern is about getting pregnant of your girlfriend from pre-ejaculatory liquid near vagina. so my straight forward answer is, yes. there are chances but it's very, very less to getting her pregnant. usually chances of getting pregnant is more when ejaculation occurs when penis is inside the vagina. but in your case as you told that your penis did not go inside the vagina, and you were just rubbing it against her outer vagina. so there is very, very less chance of getting pregnant. so don't worry, relax. you also told that u didn't have condom on that time. and there is pre-ejaculation occurs around her vagina. so there is little chances having for getting pregnant. for that you do not need to take tension because your girlfriend can use emergency contraceptive pill (i-pill) within 72 hrs of unprotected intercourse. as told by you that you people had intercourse 2 days ago. so there is sufficient time to take emergency contraception. this is usually available your nearby medical store at affordable prices. with this above discussion you can try out my suggestions-1. don't waste time and get the i-pill as early as possible. ask your girlfriend to take it. wait till her next menses. if she gets menses on her expected or delay date, she will not be pregnant. 2. you can do urinary pregnancy test after 5-6 days of her missed period. it is available at affordable prices your nearby medical store. buy it and ask your girlfriend to do it by herself. if it is negative, she's not pregnant. if it is positive visit to nearby gynecologist for further help. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further. chat doctor."

hello i am breastfeeding my 2 and a half months baby with the mix of formula milk but i don to have my period yet . a had unprotected sexual intercourse with my husband yesterday and then i took for the first time the cerazette pill the next day ( 24 hours late ) . a just want to ask if i am still safe not to get pregnant ? thank you,1,33341,"hi, if you came to my clinic with those complaints i would ask you to stop worrying. many women that start using the pills for the first time experience similar problems. i understand that you have taken the inactive pills first and then started on the active pills. also, you have had intercourse only after your period was over that is about 11 days ago. the chances of pregnancy occurring after a single act of unprotected sexual intercourse are only 4%. also, for women that have regular periods the chance of getting pregnant is more if intercourse occurs after 11-12 days since the first day of the period. hence, the chances of getting pregnant are low if you have had contact before this period. you are also having a sick feeling in the stomach and most probably a cramp like feeling. this may be due to the pills as some females take time to get adjusted and may improve with continuous use and by taking the pills with food. the pills are not known to cause any major effect on the baby if they are inadvertently taken in early pregnancy. since you have started taking the active pills late, i would recommend that you use a backup contraceptive measure like condoms, for the next 7 days while you still take the pills to avoid pregnancy. i would be pleased to answer any further queries that you may have, enjoy a wonderful day."

"hi doctor , i have been trying for pregnancy since one and a half year.i had polycystic ovarian problems . i tried allopathy medicines for some time [ like motor of , sphere , austen etc ] .i stopped that now and am using ayurveda now.my doctor says that i am alright now and he said that lack of lubrication is my problem.and the sperm is not reaching the ovum.can i use any lubrication measures ? can a suggest some .",1,73782,"hi mrs asha, welcome to chat doctor. i am chat doctor. i will be answering your concerns. i wish you had given me some more information like your age, bmi etc. dear, among couples trying for pregnancy, 80% of them conceive in the first year and 90% by the end of second year. so don't be worried. you will conceive. it is extremely important that you maintain normal bmi. otherwise, it can interfere with ovulation. i hope the infection is cleared now. if not you and your husband both need to be investigated and treated. as you are trying for pregnancy since more than a year, i suggest you consult doctor and do your baseline hormone tests and hsg for tubal patency and semen analysis for your husband. based on the results of these tests further treatment can be planned. do continue to take tab folic acid daily. to increase your chances of conception maintain normal bmi, quit smoking (if you're a smoker) and have intercourse at least three times in a week. there is no need to calculate the fertility period. it unnecessarily causes stress. having sex 3-4 times in a week automatically takes care of the fertility period. i hope this is helpful. if you have any further concerns do contact me through chat doctor. best wishes chat doctor."

a have a suffered from acne all my life .. 21 years old and in still not able to get a clear face .. my face has a few pimples here and there and mostly its red or pink scars all concentrated on my checks and chin .. i have tried many medications but it would only clear while in on medication and as soon as in finished acne would come back .. my face is oily but with some creams like isotrexin my face gets really dry red and itchy .. i have just started taking clarithromycin 250 my twice daily for a week but i was wondering if i should be using any other medications like retin-a or clindamycin gel and if i can use any kind of bleaching creams .. my face has become darker in the past while .. thank you,1,78259,"hello rama, welcome to chat doctor forum. it is very common to get pimples (acne)at this age due to the hormonal changes taking place in your body with puberty. they do subside as age advances.however, it is advisable to get it treated if you are getting pustules or nodular acne which leave behind hyperpigmented scars on the face causing the face to appear dark. so a consultation with a dermatologist would be beneficial if you really suffer from bad acne scars.meanwhile, here are some tips to help prevent breakouts and clear them up as fast as possible: 1. wash your face twice a day with warm water and a mild soap. gently massage your face. don't scrub. overwashing and scrubbing can cause skin to become irritated. 2.don't pop pimples. its tempting, but you shouldn't: popping pimples can push infected material further into the skin, leading to more swelling and redness, and even scarring. 3. avoid touching your face with your fingers or leaning your face on objects that collect sebum and skin residue like your phone. touching your face can spread the bacteria that cause pores to become inflamed and irritated. to keep bacteria at bay, wash your hands before applying anything to your face, such as treatment creams or makeup.4. keep hair clean and out of your face to prevent additional dirt and oil from clogging your pores.5. protect your skin from the sun. it may seem like a tan masks acne, but its only temporary. a tan may worsen your acne, not improve it. tanning also causes damage to skin .6. avoid over the counter acne creams as each skin type is different and creams prescribed by doctor after examining your skin are preferable. you may apply natural aloe vera gel for better results. regards"

by 2.5 yrs old son is having a white cyst like formation beneath his foreskin ( can be seen after pushing the skin backward ) under the tip of the opening of penis . to symptoms of pain or redness or swelling . please let me know how it should be treated . is there any kind of infection ?,1,37966,"hit hanks for the query. as per your explanation of symptoms and location of the swelling as you told that it is located right under the jaw shows that the lump is due to swelling in the sub mandibular salivary gland which is located just below the lower jaw. the swelling can be due to obstruction in the ducts of the salivary gland due to formation of crystalline stones in the ducts of the gland, and they are formed from the minerals present in the saliva. it leads to back flow of saliva into the gland leading to swelling. it can also be due to formation of cysts or tumors into the glands. it can also be due to infection in the gland, but an infection most commonly causes painful and tender swelling. if there is already any infection in any part of the mouth, face or any other body part and if the swelling is round and mobile can be mostly a lymph node swelling.you need not get panic as it is most commonly a non-cancerous swelling. i would suggest you to consult an oral pathologist and get evaluated for the exact cause of the swelling and get treated. obstruction in the ducts can be cleared by locating and removing the stones either by palpating and pushing the stone towards canal opening and in case of large stones a small incision placed inside mouth and stone is removed. infections in gland or lymph nodes can be treated by antibiotics. hope this helps. regards."

a have been taking camera for infertility . a had gotten my period and it was the regular length in time of 6 days . a am now on day 9 and have started bleeding again . a have also had tingling in my tongue the past couple of days . a am 27 years old and was wondering if a could have been pregnant when starting this cycle of camera without knowing it .,1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"hello . a am 19 and a was recently on my christmas break from college and went to visit my boyfriend . be had sex ( protected and unprotected ) all throughout the month of december and now my period is 5 days late . in the day my period was due a saw a very tiny spec of blood and though it was just of showing up so a wore a pad the next couple days but nothing happened . in the second day my period was late i took two hits and both negative . earlier in the month my boyfriend even asked me if i was pregnant because i was always crying and emotional , sick , and tired all of the time . also , a was eating everything in sight because a felt hungry all of the time . even a couple hours after a big meal cd feel like a was starving . the yea and since the spec of blood a be had really light cramps . they done feel like of cramps and done really hurt they re just annoying . a be never been late for my period since i was like 13 so id what this could be if in not pregnant . what do you think ?",1,37527,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. even though your boyfriends penis was inside you for only a short time, sperm can be present in pre-ejaculate (or pre-cum) and if you truly do not want to become pregnant it is really important to avoid any contact of the penis with your vagina during sexual play. the most fertile time of a woman cycle is in the middle, typically 14 days before your menstrual period would be due. so the time from when your period finishes until you start to feel pms symptoms is your fertile time. so in this case, since your boyfriend did not ejaculate, it still would be quite rare for you to have conceived. the most common sign of pregnancy is a late or delayed menstrual period. so in your case, you just need to wait for your period to arrive, and if it is late, you can do an over-the-counter urine pregnancy test which is greater than 99% accurate. pregnancy test do not become positive however until at least 2 to 3 weeks after conception. so in summary, your chances of having gotten pregnant in your particular situation is very, very low. for the future, please make sure that the penis is completely covered with a condom if it has any contact with the opening of your vagina. as long as the area is moist, sperm can swim all the way up your vagina from the opening and result in pregnancy. however, the amount of sperm in pre-cum is extremely low, so again i doubt that you need to be concerned about this one sexual encounter. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was helpful. best wishes,"

a have developed a very painful left foot . a did not do anything to make it sore . it throbs and hurts when a try to move and rotate my foot at the ankle . a first noticed tenderness and pain as a sat at the computer . would it be a clot ? that should a do ? a have been elevating for a half hour and applying an ice pack . it still hurts .,1,97040,"hi, i went through you problems. twisting injury to the foot is not always a trivial issue. it can lead to some serious injuries of the ligaments between the foot bones that can lead to chronic pain. generally foot and ankle injuries are treated with taking bed rest for a week, elevating the affected foot over two pillows, ice pack application and compression with a crêpe bandage. avoid putting weight on the foot to let the soft tissues heal. and after a week or so if it doesn't subside is when you would need a more formal evaluation. in such a case as yours, it might be worthwhile to get an x-ray done and get it shown."

(as you said he has difficulty in walking now). you can also say to his parents that --- they can continue with all religious customs along with medicines, may be then they will agree... with medicine, he will start showing improvement in few days only... it is psychosis and patients will not agree to go to any doctor willingly, so you might need to take him forcefully. this is well accepted as it is for his benefit only. even if he doesn't agree for oral medicine there are injectables which are given to such patients... take the right step, take him to a doctor. hope the reply is useful feel free to ask more questions"

"my uncle hospitalised due to vomiting of blood.after one day doctors said he is of now.but after that bleeding occurred and its not stopped and its happening intermittently , ,and blood pressure is fluctuating ( lowbp-96 ) .. may i know what is his current state ? is there anything to worry ? what can we do to help him out of this ?",1,73793,"hello, in order for accurate advice to be given more information would be needed, starting with patient sex and age, symptoms and current state, prior medical conditions, tests he's had to diagnose this clot and to determine its origin. it is such information which would allow an evaluation of whether everything has been done for him/her. speaking in general about brain damage due to a blood clot in the brain what your doctor has told you is correct. such brain damage is permanent. improvement is hoped when damage is not too extensive, but it is due to the undamaged brain compensating for the damaged cells, that process requires months, and it is usually a partial improvement not 100% of the previous state. it is not a question of medications, medication is prescribed mainly to prevent other clots with more severe consequences of happening in the future, little can be done for the cells permanently lost by the clot. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

(i) it can be that your bladder was completely full at the of ultrasound scan(ii) your kidney pelvicalyceal system is appearing full by itself (extrarenal pelvis) and is an extension of normal appearance.(iii) rarely an infection of urinary system and kidneys (recent or old) can cause such a finding, but this is likely only if you have symptoms like pain in the region of kidney and problems like burning urination or discoloration of urine or any kidney infections in the past.(iv) stones in kidney or ureter can also cause fullness of pelvicalyceal system and since you do not have any stone therefore this does not apply to you. if your doctor wants a ct scan to see only stones then giving contrast is not required. stones can be seen well on ct scan without contrast. please discuss this matter with your doctors and the radiologists before getting the ct scan done. most stones are made up of calcium and appear bright on non contrast ct scans. that is sufficient to make a diagnosis. if an infection is suspected then urine culture and sensitivity test is required."

(this is not a common scenario when compared to encountering an antibiotic resistance). so next spike of fever, kindly take your son to er, and it is better to get him admitted in the hospital, do blood and urine test and cultures and treat accordingly after ruling out other infectionsregards"

by 5 year old daughter says she is hungry constantly . is soon as well leave the restaurant or get up from the table she wants a snack . a am afraid of her becoming obese some day . is this constant hunger normal ? the is 4 foot tall and weighs about 65 lbs . the is solid .,1,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"yes hi , i had a car accident 2 days ago , i am 7 weeks pregnant , that took me to the hospital but that did not do any x-ray on my chest beaucuse of pregnancy , today after 2 days i have more pain my chest , i done know what to do , if in case i have broken part in the chest what are the side effect not to taking care of ? .thanks lily",1,1599,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the morning after pill is 90 percent effective if taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse. so, regardless of what happened with your pill taking before your pill-free week, the morning-after pill should still be effective. many women have a delayed period after taking the morning-after pill as a side effect, but the possibility of pregnancy still exists if you are late, so you should perform a urine pregnancy test just in case. if it has not been 2 weeks yet since your unprotected encounter, it may be too early to have a positive pregnancy test, so i would repeat it in a week if that is the case. in addition, many women have an irregular period or skip entirely after they stop the pill. if you are not pregnant, you can start a new pack of pills as soon as you get them, but just use a condom as a backup for the first two weeks. you should get a period in the pill-free week as you did previously. i hope i was able to answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"hello , thank you for your time . for the last couple of days a be had a sharp pain mostly on my right upper shoulder and back area . the pain comes and goes but is most evident at night . it times it goes away completely but will suddenly come back . it a the same kind of pain that you feel at the onset of the flu but it does not have the accompanying symptoms . it seems to move around from one part of my body to another .",1,77921,"most people who have gallstones do not have symptoms. if you have symptoms, you most likely will have mild pain in the pit of your stomach or in the upper right part of your belly. pain may spread to your right upper back or shoulder blade area. sometimes the pain is more severe. it may be steady, or it may come and go. or it may get worse when you eat. you may decide to go to the doctor because of pain in your belly. in this case, your doctor will ask you questions about when the pain started, where it is, and if it comes and goes or is always there. your doctor may order imaging tests. these take pictures of the inside of your body. an ultrasound of the belly is the best test to find gallstones. this test does not hurt. your ultrasound may not show gallstones. but if your doctor still thinks you have a problem with your gallbladder, he or she may order a gallbladder scan. in this test, a doctor injects dye into a vein in your arm. then a machine takes x-rays as the dye moves through your liver, bile duct, gallbladder, and intestine. if you do not have symptoms, you probably do not need treatment. if your first gallstone attack causes mild pain, your doctor may tell you to take pain medicine and wait to see if the pain goes away. you may never have another attack. waiting to see what happens usually will not cause problems. if you have a bad attack, or if you have a second attack, you may want to have your gallbladder removed. a second attack means you are more likely to have future attacks. many people have their gallbladders removed, and the surgery usually goes well. doctors most often use laparoscopic surgery. for this, your surgeon will make small cuts in your belly and remove your gallbladder. you will probably be able to go back to work or your normal routine in a week or two, but it may take longer for some people. sometimes the surgeon will have to make a larger cut to remove the gallbladder. it will take longer for you to recover from this type of surgery. regards and take care"

(regular use of emergency pill is harmful)conception occurs if she was in 10th to 18th day of her cycle(in a regular cycle of 28 day duration). you can ask her at what day she is in and wait for next cycle to occur. if it delayed by 7 days then get done upt to diagnose if pregnant and then the required treatment can be taken. regards"

"i , 2 days ago a did a home pregnancy test as a was having symptoms . it came up with a faint but clear positive . a took another this morning to be sure and again it came up a faint positive but took a bit longer for results to be clear . pm a pregnant or could the test be wrong .",1,57367,"hallow dear, the first test you performed was rather too early, hence confusing results. ideally, the pregnancy tests on urine should be performed 8-10 days after missed period on overnight early morning first urine sample for reliable results. done earlier, the tests may be false negative. however, there is another test - beta chat doctor test which can give reliable results even few days before missing period. however, even after 8 days you have got the faint positive line; i.e. weak positive test, it suggests that the hormone chat doctor is low. this happens commonly in following conditions:1. test performed too early - may be delayed conception. 2. when the baby has become non-viable. this is known as missed abortion. then chat doctor gradually starts declining and hence week positive test.3. ectopic pregnancy: in this condition the baby is implanted somewhere outside the uterine cavity, most commonly in the tube. it is a very serious condition. subsequently, tube ruptures and causes alarming bleeding. it needs blood transfusion and surgical intervention. the best option for differential diagnosis is ultrasonography. in normal pregnancy, intrauterine sac will be seen with fetal cardiac activity. in non-viable baby (missed abortion), the fetal heart will be missing and sac will be irregular. in such cases timely termination of pregnancy is indicated lest the serious complications like threatening bleeding due to clotting defects (dic), infection, kidney failure, etc. if the uterine cavity is empty in spite of (weak) positive test, it indicates that the implantation is somewhere else; i.e. ectopic pregnancy. laparoscopy will help to confirm the diagnosis. if it is unruptured ectopic pregnancy, it can be managed by laparoscopy only. please report to your gynecologist and undergo ultrasonography for correct diagnosis and managing the pregnancy appropriately. i am sure this helps you."

"an klebsiella oxytocin by treated with norfloxacine ? by girlfriend age 71 is treated for klebsiella oxytoca with norfloxacine , but after 10 days using it , she has now much pain in here urethra and bladder . here doctor refuse to give here more norfloxacine .",1,945,"hello, klebsiella is mostly and primarily found in not immunocompetent individuals, usually in hospital settings and cause the so-called hospital-acquired infections (hai). they could cause opportunistic urinary tract infections, pneumonia and other respiratory infections, bacteremia, infection of surgical wounds, etcetera. in diabetics, people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, etcetera. due to their particular structure, klebsiella species are naturally resistant to penicillin-type antibiotics, some aminoglycosides (gentamicin, kanamycin, streptomycin, etcetera.). often their treatment is possible only through the use of carbapenems and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, etcetera.). klebsiella is considered part of the normal flora in various parts of intestine and colon. recent studies have reported that recurrent klebsiella urinary tract infections are caused by persistent klebsiella found in the urinary tract even after appropriate antibiotic treatment and all persons with recurrent infections were elderly and diabetics. recurrent strains of klebsiella also had increased adhesion and invasiveness compared to colonization strains (those causing infection for the first time) and this might explain their tendency to cause repeated infections. now, it is known that frequent sexual intercourse is the strongest risk factor for recurrent urinary tract infections in healthy women, and it is why your disease comes back each time you have sex with your partner. the fact that the disease comes back after you have sex with your partner puts in high risk of future urinary tract infections. in your case the following measures could be of benefit: 1. continuous antibiotic prophylaxis for six months, by using low doses of the antibiotic that is more effective in your case. you have to consult with your doctor about which antibiotic you will use and for how long.2. post-coital therapy, by applying a single dose of the most effective antibiotic each time after having sex. you again have to consult with your doctor about the dose and type of antibiotic. 3. apply the so-called post-coital voiding that is: urinating immediately after sex.4. you should maintain high genital hygiene as it could help as well. it is also important that you have a thorough evaluation by radiological examinations in order to rule out abnormalities of the urinary tract (anatomical or functional) that could boost infection recurrence. lastly, klebsiella is not transmitted sexually, thus clearly your partner has nothing to do with your recurrent infections. but, during each intercourse, it is easier for the bacteria to get contact with your urinary tract (remember that klebsiella is a normal part of intestinal tract and colon). hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"i , i have had some dull chest pain on my left side . a become aware of the pain when a carry one of my children , i have a 3 year old an 7month old twins . a feel the dull pain on the left side of my chest/breast area . it feels to be under the breast area . to lumps . would this be something serious ? such as breast cancer . a have had an ultrasound performed on my left breast and , thankfully nothing was found however the dull pain remains . would a mammogram rule out any possibility of cancer ?",1,80686,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. is understandable to be nervous about having a lump in your breast at any age. you are correct in your knowledge that breast cancer under the age of 30 is extraordinarily rare, however any lump in the breast that is present for more than short period of time really should be evaluated. it is not recommended that mammograms be performed in women who are breast-feeding because the calcium in your milk can sometimes cause abnormalities on the mammogram that mimic cancer. however, ultrasound, a diagnostic test similar to that which are baby got while you are pregnant, can be performed on your breast to see if the lump is the cyst, or a solid mass. a specialist in diseases of the breast would be a reasonable person to see for this evaluation if your gun doctor is not willing or able to properly examine you and refer you for the ultrasound. however, i do want to reassure you that most palpable lumps found in women who are pregnant or breast-feeding are due to some clogging or other issues of the milk glands and are rarely associated with cancer. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was reassuring. best wishes and good luck,"

yes please ... my girlfriend just recently went on the pill after child birth ... child now 16 months old . the has been dealing with lot of stress and not sleeping very well now she called me from work to tell me she is feeling dizzy and light headed and has been for about 4 hours . what can she do ?,3,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"when you are diagnosed with calcification of the arterial vessels around the heart , is there anything you can do ? 5 bypass surgery done 30 years ago is completely closed . other vessels on right side of the heart are 90 % closed . blood flow is being carried mainly by collateral vessels .",1,16693,"thanks for posting your query here. there are different kinds of holes in heart. but at this age, the most common hole is asd which is a hole between the upper chambers of the heart. now coming to the treatment, i would advise you to immediately see a cardiologist and get a detailed echo to see if it is still closeable! but if there is any doubt, then she might need a right heart catheterization to see the closeable. because by this age many of the asd would have caused irreversible damage to the lung vessels and if the hole is closed without proper evaluation for this lung vessel damage then closure of the asd can do more harm than good. and if it has not caused that damage, then it must be closed either percutaneous with a device or by open-heart surgery, otherwise it would permanently damage the lung vessels. i hope this information would be of help to you. all the best."

"a am 33 weeks pregnant and yesterday morning a started getting a sharp pain in my button area . it comes and goes during the day , but when it does come , it is unexpected and it makes me jump and it is a very sharp pain when it does happen . it also feels like a am constipated and need to make stool , but a done need to.what could this be ?",1,33660,"hi there, the backed up stool and tendency to urinary tract infection does point to the idea that she could be constipated, despite being regular. regarding the frequency of bowel movements, do note that different people tend to have different bowel needs, up to 3 times a day is accepted as normal. so she could actually be going daily and still be relatively constipated. what we are aiming for is the right consistency of stools, which is long and sausage-like, with or without cracks. if you need more visual guidance, look for the bristol stool chart online, and aim for type 3 or 4. it is good that she is taking enough fibers, but also pay attention to her habits and stress to her that she needs to go when she feels like it even if it is more than once a day. constipation often occurs at this age because this is when they are getting better at holding it in, and prefer other exciting activities to sitting in the toilet. the other rarer possibility would be that she has a mild form of hirschsprungs disease, which means that some nerves are missing from the end of the colon, making the evacuating of stool difficult. most people have this diagnosed as babies, but if its very mild it can be missed. it might be more likely if she had delayed bowel movement more than a day after birth, or had tendency to constipation even as a baby. you will have to discuss with your doctor on this possibility, because confirmation would be needed with a rectal biopsy. hope this helps, and all the best to you."

"a had a a section 7 months ago and after 2 months of giving birth a started taking birth control pills , then a noticed that my urine has a very string and foul smell . a have taken this pill before for 3 years before getting pregnantand urine did to smell bad before .",2,77098,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. many women who have been on birth control for many years can develop a tolerance of sorts for the pills' ability to control your menstrual cycle, especially after they have not menstruated for a long time due to pregnancy or another cause. this can also occur to the fact that you did relatively recently give birth, especially if you were breastfeeding. bleeding when you are not supposed to have your period on the pill is called breakthrough bleeding. it does not mean the pill is ineffective as a contraceptive, but having some irregular bleeding in between periods or a different bleeding pattern that you may have had before the pregnancy is not unusual. having heavy bleeding in the morning is likely due to the blood accumulating in your vagina during the night, and then it all comes out at once when you get out of bed due to gravity. your cycle may get back to normal after a few more months on the pill, and taking it as close to the same time every day will help to reduce the risk of breakthrough bleeding. if it continues for more than 3 months, you may benefit from changing your birth control brand to one with a slightly higher dose of estrogen, as the estrogen in the pill is the ingredient that controls your menstrual cycle. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"
