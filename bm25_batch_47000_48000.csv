"hello , couple of months ago , a dentist did a filling for me . it was some kind of small tube , after filling it looks exactly like a part of tooth , same color . now a moved to italy , and here the temperature is too cold right now . a have this bad tooth / jaw ache . what could be the reason ? temperature ? also , a never had tooth ache until the day a started using sensodyne tooth paste ! a serious mistake ! by private insurance doesn't cover dental problems . are there any home remedies apart from warm water + salt ? home thing that can help me for a few months .",1,91057,"hi. can understand your concern. as per your complaint if you have pain in the gum below the tooth that was filled 3 months back there may be a few reasons for it. one can be that when the cavity was made to clear off the decay, some portion of the infection must have left out and filling was done over it. now the infection that was left out further progressed and reached pulp that is central portion of tooth containing nerves and blood vessels and through there to the root canals inside roots and finally reaching the bone below root tips causing infection and pus formation which causes pain on touching the gums. other reason can be that there could have been some leakage through the filling causing seepage of food debris below the filling and thereby causing infection which infects pulp and progresses below root tips and causes pain and pus formation. one more reason can be that the cavity made for filling is chat doctor. i would suggest you to consult your dentist and get an iop ar (x-ray)done so that the exact cause of pain is understood. in most circumstances of pain in tooth after filling the treatment to be carried out is root canal treatment in which entire pulp is extirpated and filling is done in root canals as well as crown of tooth... hope your query is solved. thanks and regards."

hi i have a lump in my left breast but the pins and needles are in my nipple and all over the breast in scared cos my mum died of lung cancer can you please tell me its fine.i am 37years old.i have been going throw the change of life from i was 28 years old can a help,1,36160,hi. thanks for your query and an elucidated history. the lump at the back of the neck can not cause a direct problem of pins and needles in the arm. it is possible that the muscle spasm caused by this lump can indirectly cause nerve pressure or pinching. get fnac done of the lump and the mri should have been done to see if there is a protruding disc causing pressure on the spinal cord which causes the pins and needles feeling in the upper limb as you have. it is wise to get an opinion f a surgeon for the lump and of the neurologist for pins and needles sensation in the arm.
hi i have a lump in my left breast but the pins and needles are in my nipple and all over the breast in scared cos my mum died of lung cancer can you please tell me its fine.i am 37years old.i have been going throw the change of life from i was 28 years old can a help,2,82366,"hello friend, thank you for posting your query through chat doctor. i am a homeopath answering your query and the answer which i am going to give you may contain several thoughts which may appear strange or new for you. this i say because homeopathy is a new system of medicine and is almost unheard by the majority of the population. therefore, due to the high influence of the conventional medicine the people at large are brainwashed to believe and act according to the health education given by them. coming back to the fibroadenoma of your left breast in the year 1979, you had a psychological conflict in the mind level. you are a sensitive individual and that is why your left breast was affected. it must have been related with your child chat doctor. the sensitivity is genetic, and you reacted to the conflict through the brain according to a genetic programming. mind-brain - organ affection resulted in the development of a lump in your left breast in 1979. you consulted your gynecologist, and he suggested that it may turn to become cancerous in future and so it is better to remove it, and you subdued to his suggestion. actually the lump in the breast was an attempt of the body to cure you, or it was the result of a self defense mechanism. since you had not resolved the conflict in the psychological level, the lump remained there without getting resolved. but the body kept the lump protected in a cyst with minimum amount of inflammation called chronic cystitis. by removing the fibroadenoma or chronic cystic mastitis, you were not cured, but your lump in the breast was removed. in 1995 also you are the same person, you are the same sensitive person, and you underwent another more serious psychological conflict and the same left breast was again affected in a more serious manner. instead of recognizing the mass as a defense mechanism, you got the fear in you that you have cancer. the tissue changes also suggested that there is more serious pathology, and they labelled your lump this time as cancer and suggested removal of your left breast. if you could have recognized the lump as a defense mechanism and if you had no fear of cancer, you could have retained your breast. but the fear of cancer is such that it is associated with death and so you lost your breast. in no case, either by removal of lump in 1979 or by removal of your breast in 1995, you are not cured only your disease is cured. hope by this time you have got the answer for your query. both are related to each other because they are in the same individual, same sensitivity, same program. homeopathy cures the person and once the individual is cured all his diseases will be cured. with best wishes,"

a had demo injection on 10/19/11 . my lmp was on 10/07/11 . today is the 9th day after the injection . a would like to ask if its safe to have an intercourse now or shall a wait for another 5 days ? because some says it should be 2 weeks after the injection before you can have sex . its my first time to use this demo that why a want to be careful.and is it normal to have breast tenderness ? coz my original cycle will fall out this week if a didst have the injection .,1,22940,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, the depo-provera injection becomes immediately effective against pregnancy the day you get the shot. the reason why it is recommended for you to start taking demo while you have your period is to make sure that you have not already become pregnant and get the injection while pregnant. so if you had a shot two weeks ago, even if you had a condom accident, and especially since you took morning-after pill, there is no reason to suspect that you are risk for pregnancy. however, a urinary tract infection, which is inflammation of the bladder, can occur after sex if chafing during sex especially externally rubs bacteria into the urethra (the urinary opening). this is common in women who use condoms as the ring on the condom can irritate this area during penetration. so i think you can be reassured that your symptoms are not due to pregnancy. however, i think you most likely do have a uti and should visit your local physician or clinic for evaluation, so you can get a prescription for antibiotics to treat it. if you are now going to be having unprotected sex with your current partner, you both should be tested for stds to make sure that you are not at risk of giving anything to one another. however, this point there is no evidence that your symptoms could be caused by an std. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

to i just found out i was pregnant . and be and my brother do boxing .. i was hit in the stomach repeatedly ... directly after that i had a gush of blood come out .. i have been having mild cramping .. and the other day i had a brown thick gross discharge just come at a rush . what is this ?,1,49083,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. many women can miscarry naturally, meaning pass the fetus at home and have no medical consequences afterwards. however, it is important for you to know that all the tissue has actually come out of your uterus, because even a small speck of pregnancy tissue left inside you can cause you to bleed irregularly, put you at risk for uterine infection, and prevent you from being able to get pregnant again until it is removed. what i would do in your situation, is bought an over-the-counter urine pregnancy test and retest yourself right before your doctor's appointment. if your pregnancy test still comes out positive i do recommend that you follow up with the doctor. this is just to make sure that all the tissue has come out from your miscarriage and that there are no complications that will affect you in the future. furthermore, 15% of women bleed in the first trimester of pregnancy, and even though you had a lot of bleeding there is still a possibility your pregnancy could be viable. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"my mum has just been told she has thickening of the womb after months of pain and bleeding . what is this thickening can it be bad ? the is 80 with high of , not over weight .",3,107969,"hi. thanks for asking in chat doctor. the return of menstruation after a progesterone injection like demo proverb is usually delayed. the cycles take many months to normalize and sometimes there may be complete suppression of periods. the increase of weight in the abdominal area is due to bulky uterus. normally during period, the endometrial cells of uterus proliferate (multiply) resulting in thickening of endometrium (inner lining of uterus) due to the action of estrogen. when menstruation starts this endometrium is shed out as clots and the uterus reverts to the normal size. since you have not got the periods, the thickened endometrium has resulted in bulky uterus. also, the hormonal imbalance due to absent period has added to your problem of weight gain. an ultrasound of uterus will reveal the size of uterus and the endometrial thickening. since endometrial proliferation can be either simple or can result in problems like cancer, you should visit a gynecologist for a proper evaluation and to rule out problems like cancer. i hope this is useful."

(as you said he has difficulty in walking now). you can also say to his parents that --- they can continue with all religious customs along with medicines, may be then they will agree... with medicine, he will start showing improvement in few days only... it is psychosis and patients will not agree to go to any doctor willingly, so you might need to take him forcefully. this is well accepted as it is for his benefit only. even if he doesn't agree for oral medicine there are injectables which are given to such patients... take the right step, take him to a doctor. hope the reply is useful feel free to ask more questions"

(would you be having it then?) now your cycle is of 30 days period. so the expected date of ovulation should be 07 january. hence, if the conception takes place on 07 january, the due date of delivery would be 30 september. the hitch here is that you should have ovulation taking lace on 07 january. moreover, we have noticed that all the pregnancies do not last for 280 days. the delivery can take place any time between 3 weeks earlier to 1 week later than the expected due date of delivery. keeping these facts and calculations in mind, you may plan your sexual relations accordingly. i hope this will help you."

(of course, once he is sleepy or has gone to sleep, you can remove them for the entire night). there is no truth in the belief that if you keep the glasses on, the number will reduce. in fact, if his eye is developing a problem that will cause his number to increase, even his wearing the glasses continuously cannot prevent this from happening. there is nothing that you can do to ensure that these changes do not happen. your ophthalmologist is the best person to take counsel from. he should check the children lens and the entire eye to determine how the future will go. i would advise you to continue following his advice and to never neglect your sons eyes, as neglected error of refraction will affect his learning at school, his brain development and all aspects of his life. best wishes."

a recently had a cbc w/ differentials done . a was told a have low red blood cell counts indicating anaemia and a higher platelet count . a am being referred to a hematologist/oncologist . should a have reason to be concerned ? by hgb is 9.6 my hematocrit is 31.7 mcv is 72.7 mch is 22 mchc is 30.3 rdw is 18.3 and platelets are 590 . that kind of tests will they do to rule things in and out ? does this look like it is all from anaemia or something else ?,1,50324,"first mcv is a way to measure the average size or volume of the individual blood cells in femtoliters, which normally has to be in the range between eighty and one hun chat doctor. mch is the way to measure the amount of hemoglobin in the average red blood cell, which should be twenty-seven to thirty-one picograms per cell. if the mcv is not within the normal range, this means that the red blood cells are either larger or smaller than they normally should be. with a high mvc, this means that a person may be suffering from pernicious or hemolytic anemia. some causes of a high mcv can include alcohol abuse, nutritional deficiencies, or a deficiency in folic acid or vitamin b12. if the mcv is low a person could have thalassemia, gastrointestinal blood loss, or iron deficiency anemia. most of the time, an abnormal mcv just means that you have some form of anemia. when they consider the mch in the complete blood count test, it is a measurement of what the approximate amount of oxygen-carrying hemoglobin is in the red blood cell. it is the red blood cells are large they are referred to as microcytic and will usually have a higher mch. if the red blood cells are smaller they are referred to as microcytic and has a lower mch, if the complete blood count test comes back showing that you have high mch this can indicate that you have microcytic anemia. this type of anemia is caused by not having enough vitamin b12 or folic acid. how to treat an mch that is high depends on the cause of it being this way. treatment also depends on any other medication they may be taking or medical conditions the patient might have. if microcytic anemia is the cause, adding vitamin b12 and folic acid supplements will help. regards"

a have a slightly tender lump in my armpit . it has been there for a few months and only feels painful when a push on it . it is about the size of a quarter . a have also been wheezing and coughing for about the same period . not sure if they are related .,1,34485,"it would have helped had you told me if your entire thyroid was removed or only half. since it was cancerous it is more likely that the whole thyroid was removed. normally, after removing the thyroid for cancer, a thyroid scan is done 6 weeks later to confirm that the entire cancer has been removed and if any is remaining to destroy it with medicines. it is only after this scan that tab thyroxine is started (the thyroid hormone that you will have to take for life) and the dose is titrated over a period of months to make the tsh normal. if you have not been given thyroxine because you are scheduled for a scan then the spotty periods and high tsh are normal as they are both features of a subnormal thyroid state. they are not related to your cancer and nothing to worry about. if you are not scheduled for a scan, talk to your doctor and get one. if you are already on thyroxine and the scan has been done, then the dose needs to be increased."

hi . i am a 21 year old male medical student ... i had exceptional rhabdomyolysis 2 weeks ago .. now i am completely back to normal regarding of levels .. the problem is my alt and ast did to drop back to normal .. i had an abdominal ultrasound that revealed a mildly enlarged fatty liver ( 17 pm ) .. my alt level is in the 200 a and ast level is in the 60 s. i have a perfect body mass index but i have a lot of fat in my body especially in the abdominal region . the doctor prescribed silymarin with acetyl cysteine .. now where should i go from here ?,1,28200,"hi, i had gone through your question and understand your concerns. firstly, i must stress that one or a few of the liver function tests should not be interpreted in isolation. the entire hepatic function panel should be ideally be available along with the normal laboratory reference ranges for a meaningful interpretation. you have provided only the ast and alt values. therefore, i can only answer in general terms. serum aminotransferases: are of two types.- alpine aminotransferase (alt) and- aspartame aminotransferase (ast). elevations of these are the two of the most useful indicators of liver cell injury. the ast is less live specific than the alt. elevations of the ast level may also be seen in acute muscle injury, (cardiac or skeletal muscle). mild degrees of alt level elevation may occasionally be seen in skeletal muscle injury or even after vigorous physical exercise. disproportionate elevations of the ast and alt levels when compared with the alkaline phosphatase level arise in diseases that primarily affect hepatocytes (ex; viral hepatitis). the ast/alt ratio is not very useful in determining the cause of liver injury, except in acute alcoholic hepatitis, wherein, the ratio is usually > 2 and the ast level is 400 iu/ml or lower. common causes of mild increases in ast and alt levels is fatty liver disease seen most often in the context of obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and alcohol abuse. the ratio of ast to alt may give additional clues as to the cause:- in chronic liver disease with early cirrhosis alt > ast,- in chronic liver disease with established cirrhosis ast > alt. extremes of the ratio of ast:alt may also be sometimes useful:- ratio >2 suggests alcoholic hepatitis, and-do not worry. it will take around 6 months for the enzymes to be normal again. hope this answers your question. if you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. i will be happy to answer your questions. wishing your daughters good health."

"hi , our 3 month old son has been diagnosed wit paroles syndrome , my partners dad passed away from liver problems and we know that it is genetic , my partner is been checked for the same thing but we want to know if our son is going to suffer the same path as my partners dad ?",3,78169,"hi, how are you? i am really sorry to hear about your dads' diagnosis, but it is indeed good news that he has cleared hepatitis b. what is his age? unlike hepatitis c, in hepatitis b, there is usually no need to take treatment if your liver function is normal and if your viral load is low. he will need additional tests to look for other markers of infection and to see if you are infective to others (hepatitis b pcr, antics ab, anti hbc ab, anti he ab, ). based on this we can categorize your dad as a carrier or as someone who has cleared the virus. most people will clear the virus by themselves without any treatment. only a minority become chronic carriers and only a minority in them will develop cirrhosis at a later stage. hepatitis b only needs treatment if the viral load is very high or if the liver is being damaged as evident from blood tests. hepatitis c on the other hand is more aggressive disease and most people do develop some form of liver damage over the years. this is the reason why most doctors will treat this disease aggressively in order to obtain a cure. but treatment will depend on the viral load (hep c viral pcr) and the genotype of the virus (1,2,3,4) as different genotypes need different treatment, and they respond differently to treatment as well. but the hepatitis c treatment is toxic to the body (damages liver and bone marrow) and so can be given only to those who can tolerate it. if the liver has already been damaged i, e has become cirrhotic, then i think you should start thinking in terms of getting a liver transplant done for your dad. hope this helped and hope your dad feels better. please do not hesitate to contact me for further details, esp regarding places in india which treats hepatitis c and which offer liver transplant - rxsuresh@gmail.com"

"a have been to the toilet 5-6 times now . last night sit was light brown and red like pure blood . with terrible abdominal pain on lower left side with copious amounts of gurgling . it has woken me twice , the pain . it a remains there like a cramp , and now there was gas followed by mucus and a trace of pink ( blood ) smells a bit fishy too",1,16737,"hallow dear, brown vaginal bleeding is old bleeding which remains inside for few days and then comes out. when it is of substantial amount, we suspect risk to the life of the baby. however, the bleeding was trivial and after such bleeding, you have been examined in the hospital and sent home with assurance. so no need to worry about the baby. it is likely that the mouth of the uterus (cervix) has started preparing for the delivery by getting gradually merged into the uterine walls. this process known as effacement of the cervix causes dislodgement of the mucous plug in the cervical canal with some bleeding. when such blood stained mucous come out immediately, it is red, however if it remains inside the vagina (due to very little amount or position) or cervix, the blood and thus the discharge becomes brown. however, 36 weeks is too early for starting labor process. so i would advise you to have complete rest in the house in a view to postpone the starting of labor pains as far as possible, at least for one week more. it would be good practice to monitor the well-being of the baby by listening to heart sounds (if you can do that) and/or counting the movements of the baby by clock. in left side position lying, in two hours, 10 movements are perceivable. if you note fetal movements getting affected, please report to the obstetrician asap. i hope this helps you."

my daughter just had an ultrasound is 24 weeks pregnant and the ultrasound tech was concerned because the babes was in the same position it was in during the previous ultrasound ..... head down and not moving much . the tech tried to stimulate babes but still did to move much . verbalized concerns to my daughter about talking to a baby doctor due to the fact the baby should be moving around more in the womb . when my daughter called her pa-c they said the measurements of the baby were fine . is there anything to worry about . not sure if she is getting the of done same time each time ........,1,284,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. if your baby is in the head up position at term, it is not recommended that you deliver vaginally, because there is risk to the baby of birth injury. so if you reach your due date with your baby in the head up position, your obstetrician will likely recommend cesarean section. however, there is a possibility that the baby could turn around on its own. ways to help this to happen is to do what you can to let your belly hang to give the baby a chance to rollover. going on your hands and knees and arching your back high into the air, like an angry cat, for 10 minutes every day, can sometimes help the baby to turn around naturally. however, the best way to help the baby to turn around is for your obstetrician or midwife to perform a procedure called a version. in the us, versions, which literally are done by the doctor pushing the baby into a somersault is performed under ultrasound guidance in a hospital setting. it works about 50% of the time and can give a woman a chance at a normal vaginal delivery. regarding the cord around the babies neck, 15% of normally delivered infants have an umbilical cord around their neck. so the presence of the cord around the neck now does not mean that there will be any problems with labor and delivery if the baby is able to get into the right position. if you are considering having a version, i suggest that you speak to your delivering provider about it soon, as the success rates of version decrease significantly after 37 weeks. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and this information was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy and delivery,"

"a be had this tightness in my chest on the left that shoots into my left elbow for like two days now .. it doesn't hurt as much when it started yesterday , but today is a new day and its still there . the pain is weird like some one squeezing me and stabbing me at the same time , i done want to make a big deal out of nothing",1,44855,"greetings. welcome to chat doctor, and thank you for your question. i understand your concern. your age would help me a lot in constructing a differential diagnosis. however, i will explain some forms of chest pain, which we aim to exclude first, as the main and most dangerous organic causes of it. first, there is angina. angina is a moderate-to-severe chest pain, more characterized like a heaviness or tenderness or ""squeezing"" feeling, localized in the mid-chest, and then radiates to the both sides of the chest, the jaw, left shoulder and left arm. this is the pain originated from one or more blockages within the coronary arteries (arteries that supply the heart muscle with oxygen and nutrients). if this is your case, you should perform an ekg and an echocardiogram, and, depending on these two tests, a cardiac stress test. second, there is sharp, stabbing pain. this kind of pain can come from an enlargement of the root of the aorta and/or from aortic aneurysm. it is severe in intensity, and radiates to the back, between the wings. also, it can be caused by an acute or chronic inflammation to the linings within the rib cage, i.e. the pleura (lining of the lungs) and pericardium (the lining of the heart). this kind of pain - pleuritic pain - is less severe than that caused by aortic aneurysm, and relieves or aggravates from switching positions or the respiratory cycle. if this is the case, then echocardiogram (for pericardium and root of the aorta), chest x-ray (for the pleura and the lungs), and computed tomography of the aorta (in case we suspect that there is a problem with the aorta, higher than its root), should be performed. there is always a possibility of intercostal (between ribs) muscle or pectoral (chest) muscle soreness, and pain originated from problems with ribs and rib joints. if this is the case, you can use over the counter painkillers. i hope i was thorough with my answer. best regards."

hi my name is andrea and my right kidney is smaller then the left one . the right one is 9.8 pm and the left one is 12.1 pm . i just want to know if this is something i should worry about and if this could cause my high blood pressure ? i also have it could it be because of that ? i was an prednison for 1 year . than you for your time .,1,56709,"hello and thank you for using chat doctor. i carefully read your question and i understand your concern. i will try to explain you something and give you my opinion related to your questions. you should know that we talk about hypertension if we have mean values above 140/90 mmhg. we can not judge if we have hypertension with one only value. a person might have high blood pressures after a physical or emotional stress, so it is mandatory to judge on mean values, during all day. hypertension is divided in two groups: the fist one is essential hypertension, without an identifiable cause, usually in older ages. it is a chronic disease that does not have a cure, but it should be treated all live. once it is diagnosed, it should be treated always with medicine. the other group is secondary hypertension meaning that it is a second disease causing it, that might be renal, endocrinological or cardiovascular anomaly. resolving the causing pathology might resolve the hypertension. so, the first thing to do in your case is to know if we really are dealing with hypertension or not. the second one is to know what kind of hypertension is it and then we can judge how to treat it. if i was your treating doctor i will recommend a blood pressure holder monitoring to have a full view of your values, during day and night. during mornings people have bigger activity and for this might have higher blood pressure values. i will recommend a cardiac echo to evaluate heart anatomy. after this a fool blood check up, your urinary catecholamine and an abdominal echo to see the renal situation. only after this we can know how to treat your hypertension. if you have high values they should be treated with medications. physical activity is not good if you have uncontrolled high blood pressure values, because during activity the values rises even more. it is necessary to start treating it and then start physical activity. if it is essential hypertension you will treat it all live. hope i was helpful. wish you good health. best regards."

(there's nothing much you can do to avoid, but just be vigilant to identify things early).2. get regular usg to make sure the left kidney is fine.3. it is possible for the right kidney function to reduce further as the child grows. this is because the left kidney will grow normally while your right won't. most of the time, the left kidney will enlarge and take up the extra-work. just monitor his bp and if it goes out of range, get him treated."

"yes doctor , an ferrous sulphate and folic acid tablets prevent conception ? a have discovered that my wife secretly takes these tables . when we married in 1999 , she had first degree barrenness , which was treated through laparoscopy . after conceiving 2 girls in 2003 and 2005 respectively , she has never conceived and yet a needed to add one more child . a have always suspected her of secretly taking prescriptions . now a have found these tablets in the room and yet no one is anaemic .",1,36471,"hi, folic acid supplements are given to prevent defects in the babies spine and brain from 3 months before conception to 12 weeks of pregnancy. brain and spine development takes place between 25 and 35 days of life approximately which is the critical period when adequate folic acid should be available. since your wife had taken folic acid before she conceived, it is very unlikely for you to have a neural tube defect in your babies.also, neural tube defects are more common in women with previous babies with neural tube defects, women who are diabetic, epileptic and who have certain enzyme deficiencies. usual dose of folic acid is 400 micrograms only. in women with higher risk like diabetics, epileptics previous babies with defects, or women with twins we give 5 mg.10 mg is not advisable. hope this helps. regards"

"i , a am 12 weeks pregnant . a was prescribed clarithromycin 500mg at 11 weeks . a took it for 3 days ( 5 tablets in all ) before my midwife strongly advised me to stop taking it . that risk has my baby had as a result of taking this ? a had taken amoxicillin 500mg for 3 days before this but it had no effect on a severe sinus infection , hence my doctor changed over to the clarithromycin .",1,33341,"hi, if you came to my clinic with those complaints i would ask you to stop worrying. many women that start using the pills for the first time experience similar problems. i understand that you have taken the inactive pills first and then started on the active pills. also, you have had intercourse only after your period was over that is about 11 days ago. the chances of pregnancy occurring after a single act of unprotected sexual intercourse are only 4%. also, for women that have regular periods the chance of getting pregnant is more if intercourse occurs after 11-12 days since the first day of the period. hence, the chances of getting pregnant are low if you have had contact before this period. you are also having a sick feeling in the stomach and most probably a cramp like feeling. this may be due to the pills as some females take time to get adjusted and may improve with continuous use and by taking the pills with food. the pills are not known to cause any major effect on the baby if they are inadvertently taken in early pregnancy. since you have started taking the active pills late, i would recommend that you use a backup contraceptive measure like condoms, for the next 7 days while you still take the pills to avoid pregnancy. i would be pleased to answer any further queries that you may have, enjoy a wonderful day."

hi a have no insurance and have been diagnosed with a kidney tutor and the doctor said that it may be cancer which he said was about 85 % chance of kidney cancer this has been going on since december and still don to have a date for surgery yet should a be concerned,1,98063,"hi, thanks for writing in. it is good that cancer of throat has been diagnosed at early stage. the chances for cure and post treatment survival are high in that case. if you have been unable to meet your known doctor then it will be best to take the patient to a tertiary cancer center like tata memorial hospital and get him evaluated in the head and neck cancer services. surgery is the choice treatment in stage 1 throat cancer. you also have to get detailed investigations like ct scan or mri scan and if possible pet scan after consulting the concerned doctor. this will help in accurate staging and planning of surgery. the surgery is done with removal of cancer area with a margin of normal tissue. after surgery the patient might also have to be treated with chemotherapy and radiation for a better treatment result. please do not worry."

"last month a had carpal tunnel surgery with 2 pregnancy tests given both were negative . a have missed my period this month so a took a pregnancy test . it came back positive . by tubes are tied , so went to my dr. the gave me a pregnancy test , came back positive , then a blood test , came back positive . not an ultrasound done , and it showed a cyst on my cervix . on to see a ob/gym until monday . is the cyst causing the positives or could a be pregnant . wait is killing me .",1,110792,"hello, thanks for using chat doctor i have read your query with a lot of concern. the first thing i find is a little ambiguity as to why your hit were positive and two weeks later negative. it most likely scenario is that the hit gave false positive results. normally, pregnancy test becomes positive at two weeks after fertilization i.e. about the time the next menses was about to start, and the first symptom thus is absent of menses in most cases. if truly, the tests were positive, then you might have been pregnant long before you even started taking the chat doctor. however, this is also ambiguous because it requires averagely three weeks for the test to become negative after termination of pregnancy. if you recently became pregnant and it's less than 4 weeks(you have not yet missed your period), the hit will be negative. best regards"

"hello doctor , by wrist and pinky area has started to twitch for the last few weeks . a was diagnosed with epilepsy 6 years ago . with in the last 7 months a did not have any episodes of seizures , then 2 weeks ago a had 2 mild episodes out of the blue . could the twitching be from the seizures ? ?",1,53368,"i read your question and i understand your concern. from your description of the episodes they can indeed be a case of seizures. they shouldn't be related to the back surgery itself. the eeg being normal doesn't exclude the diagnosis as it can be the case in the interval without seizures. regarding the tests i think apart from routine lab tests (including electrolytes and tests for autoimmune disease), brain imaging is also required as at this age usually seizures have an identifiable cause. also, the eeg can be repeated because repeated eeg's increase the chance of chancing upon epileptiform anomalies. if the seizures are frequent i would consider being admitted to a neurology clinic, in order for the seizures to be seen by personnel which is used to the features of epilepsy and more qualified to distinguish seizures from other attacks like psychogenic ones or syncope. there are specialized clinics where prolonged eeg accompanied by video recordings side by side make for a better evaluation. if the seizures are rare, you live in a remote area and the doctor never happens to see one, you could also yourself film the episodes (with your smartphone if you have one) and show them to your doctor to facilitate his evaluation of them. if the clinical signs are convincing a normal eeg shouldn't be an obstacle to starting treatment. i hope to have been of help."

"hello , a was just wondering if a have symptoms of genital herpes/ warts or if it is agitation from shaving or is it bug bites ? in the past few months a have had protected vaginal sex with several partners , but sometimes unprotected oral sex and fingering has occurred . the last time was a few days ago , but the window in the house i was in was open , and a have had two other red bite like marks on my arms and underarm since that day also . a have three under the skin red spots near and around my clitoris and they are very itchy , along with a slightly less itchy vagina , but these lumps are soothed by sudocream . this occurred on my genitals a day after shaving , but a have never had bumps like before , although i am prone to shaving rash . i was just wondering if this sounds like genital herpes and also how long symptoms take to first appear ? thanks in advance",1,35013,"hi, thanks for posting in chat doctor. i understand your concern. genital herpes is a disease caused by the herpes simplex virus (hsv). hsv is of two types: 1. type 1 (hsv-1), which usually causes oral herpes in the form of infection of the lips and mouth. symptoms are commonly known as cold sores or fever blisters. in the past, hsv-1 was not known to cause genital herpes, but that is changing, especially among people who begin having sex at a young age. 2. type 2 (hsv-2), which, in most cases, causes genital herpes. hsv-1 is usually passed from person to person by kissing. hsv-1 can also spread from the mouth to the genitals during oral sex. if infection occurs, it becomes a case of genital herpes.hsv-2 is most often passed by vaginal sex and anal sex. but just as hsv-1 can infect the genitals and cause genital herpes, hsv-2 can pass from one person's genitals to another persons mouth, resulting in oral herpes. hence, hsv-1 can also be transmitted to the genitals through oral/genital sex and about 40% of genital herpes is caused by hsv-1. it would be advisable not to have oral sex at this stage as it carries a risk for transmission of infection. hope the information provided would be helpful. all the best."

hi my name is asia davidson i have very severe asthma and last year i got my tonsils removed but the doctor took out my uvula as well but i did to know that was being removed is it safe for a person like me who is suffering from a horrible condition to have my uvula removed,1,47449,"hi, the uvula must have been removed because of a condition known as obstructive sleep apnea. the procedure can be done in an asthmatic person and there is no contraindication to this. rather tonsillectomy is usually avoided in asthmatic patients as the tonsils act as barrier to the lower respiratory tract. but if your doctor has done a tonsillectomy, he/she must have assessed you regarding this and the benefits of tonsillectomy must have over weighted the harm it can cause. regards"
hi my name is asia davidson i have very severe asthma and last year i got my tonsils removed but the doctor took out my uvula as well but i did to know that was being removed is it safe for a person like me who is suffering from a horrible condition to have my uvula removed,2,55221,"hi, how are you? i am so sorry to hear about your fathers condition. one thing not clear form your question is whether the stone in the bile duct was removed. stenting is normally done after ercp and stone removal to give the bile duct a chance to heal. once adequate time has elapsed, the stent no longer serves any purpose and hence is removed. the reason it has to be removed or exchanged with a new one at regular intervals is due to the fact that long-standing stents are prone to blockage and infection both of which can have potentially serious consequences. but given your dads condition, and if he does not have any symptoms like pain, fever, jaundice, etc. it is my opinion that you could wait on the stent removal with a very, very low threshold to get it removed if any symptoms arise. hope this helps, and please do not hesitate to contact me for further clarifications."

"i . be and my husband have been trying to get pregnant since september . be were successful in january and at 9 weeks a had a miscarriage . a am an athlete and a have really took a step back with working out . a am a vegetarian but eat fish , and a do like to drink wine on occasion usually with dinner . a am getting frustrated with trying every month and learning that a am once again unsuccessful with getting pregnant . to my question is does it take longer to get pregnant after a miscarriage ? and do you have any advice on what else a could do .",1,108096,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. it is true that theoretically you should have been clear of the injection within three months of discontinuation, however many women after being a depo-provera for a long time do not resume having ovulatory, regular, menstrual cycles until 6 to 9 months or even up to a year after discontinuation. unfortunately, it is difficult to artificially induce ovulation in women who are coming off depo-provera. if you were not trying to become pregnant, your cycle could be regulated temporarily with birth control pills, but if you're actually trying to get pregnant the best thing you can do with this point is to just keep trying and wait and see. if you feel any symptoms of pregnancy, and you haven't gotten your period for a while, i would do pregnancy test just to make sure. there is always a possibility even if your periods are not regular that you do ovulate sometimes. so in summary, continue having unprotected sex every other to every three days and give it some more time. 80% of couples will conceive within one year, and if after a year of trying you and your partner are unsuccessful, it might be a good idea to see a fertility specialist for an evaluation. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes, and good luck getting pregnant,"

(as you said he has difficulty in walking now). you can also say to his parents that --- they can continue with all religious customs along with medicines, may be then they will agree... with medicine, he will start showing improvement in few days only... it is psychosis and patients will not agree to go to any doctor willingly, so you might need to take him forcefully. this is well accepted as it is for his benefit only. even if he doesn't agree for oral medicine there are injectables which are given to such patients... take the right step, take him to a doctor. hope the reply is useful feel free to ask more questions"

ave been on the sep shot for a year me and my boyfriend has had unprotected sex and he has came inside of me ... every morning that a have got up ave had a brown discharge but it only occurs in the morning .... pm also having lower back pain .... stomach cramps .... by the way a done have a period at all anymore because of the demo shot ... could a be pregnant ?,1,15745,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. first, if you are late for your shot and have had unprotected sex, even if you are bleeding, you should do a urine pregnancy test. if your pregnancy test is negative, many women do not have regular periods come back after discontinuing the depo-provera injection for even up to 6 months. this, however, does not mean that you cannot become pregnant. if you are not actively trying to get pregnant, a good way to help regulate your cycles until your own body resumes a regular cycle is by taking birth control pills. birth control pills make you get a light, regular, predictable cycle every month and will help control breakthrough bleeding (the brown staining you have all the time). many women have irregular bleeding in the first 6 months to a year of using the shot, and unfortunately the same thing can happen after you discontinue it. so, in summary, all the irregular bleeding you are having is likely due to your discontinuing the demo shot. if you need contraception, the monthly cycle birth control pill would be a good option that can also help you have regular cycles. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"a received a composite filling for one of my molars two weeks ago ever since the tooth has been sensitive to cold and hot beverages . a even feel pain when a chew food ( but not when a press on it with my finger ) this never happened while a had the cavity . in fact , a even told the dentist a felt pain when she was putting the filling in but she did not say anything . would you please give me an idea of what could be the problem ?",1,93247,"a thing to keep in mind is that it is quite common to feel a bit of pain after a filling has been done. your teeth and the surrounding region might be sensitive to the material that has been used for the filling and the trauma that it has undergone. give it time to heal, and the filling will settle down. if the toothache persists even after a few weeks of the filling then something is certainly amiss. all that you need to do is to go to the dentist for a second time and explain the pain and how you feel. the dentist will then be able to ascertain the reason for the pain after the filling and ad chat doctor. the dentist might advise you to use a sensitive toothpaste or put on a desensitizing agent on the tooth. after all of this, if the pain still persists then all that you can do is to have a root canal treatment done to get rid of the pain after the filing."

"i a have a simple question , a am on sprinter birth control and a just finished my period sunday a did to take my pills friday- today tuesday.i need a new refill .. a had unprotected sex last night monday . is there a possibility for me to become pregnant ?",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

i am on the birth control pill but i have been talking it irregularly lately . a couple days ago my boyfriend came inside of me . last night i threw up 20 minutes after i took my pill so i a not sure if it settled in my system . is there a chance i could be pregnant . ?,2,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

hi i was wondering if you are able to tell me something .. in now 29 weeks pregnant and my baby is fine ... but when i first fell pregnant i had a really heavy bleed and a clot came from me i never went to see about it .. i think i was already pregnant at the time i was just wondering what this heavy bleed was ? hope you can answer my question it would be very helpful ..,1,64038,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. unfortunately, being pregnant does not keep you from getting sick or having other problems that anyone else does. in my experience though, dentists are very reluctant to treat pregnant women even though there is no risk to the baby from routine dentistry. but since you just noticed this bump, i think there is time for you to wait until the baby is born to see a dentist, especially because it may be difficult to persuade someone to treat you. obviously if you begin to experience pain, bleeding or anything to indicate that this could be more serious, then i would seek dental care. your ob practitioner may need to write them a note saying that it is safe to treat you. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"by mother is 60 years old , in us it was observed that she has the following diagnosis,1.prominent liver with mild cirrhotic changes , mild ascites and cholelithiasis and left ovarian separate cysts is obseved.please suggest treatment.regards , init arena",1,100031,"the major concern with this ultrasound is the cirrhotic liver with ascites. when the liver is badly damaged with scarring (cirrhosis), it doesn't work very well. blood flowing through the scarred liver gets backed up and creates high pressure in the liver, which in turn results in fluid leaking in to the abdomen (ascites). unfortunately, cirrhosis with ascites may be an indication that his liver is starting to fail. the kidney shows that a stone is present, but that does not seem to be causing any problems. no other findings are of significance. what needs to be done now is to take a sample of the ascites fluid and determine if it is truly related to the liver cirrhosis or something else. liver disease is the most common cause of ascites, but other conditions may cause it as well, and treatment may differ. further investigation of the liver status may also be needed, such as a biopsy. usually the spleen is enlarged when ascites develops with a cirrhotic liver, and his spleen is normal, so perhaps another more treatable condition is present. liver failure from cirrhosis is the worst case scenario. further evaluation should help define his situation better. hope this helps."

hi am in 21 weeks of pregnancy . with recent ultrasound test amniocentesis test i found my baby has bilateral cleft lip and doctors say that the child might have genetic disorder too which can be confirmed only after delivery . is it possible for me to terminate the pregnancy right now ?,1,47918,"hi, a detailed ultrasound can help to know if the baby has other structural abnormalities. a fetal 2d echo of fetal heart can help see if baby has abnormalities of the heart. termination depends on which country you reside in. in india, it is absolutely not allowed after 20 weeks. the cells collected at amniocentesis can rule out any major genetic abnormality. bilateral cleft lip can be surgically corrected after birth by a pediatric surgeon. regular scan of the baby can help monitor if it is developing any abnormality. hope this helps. regards."
hi am in 21 weeks of pregnancy . with recent ultrasound test amniocentesis test i found my baby has bilateral cleft lip and doctors say that the child might have genetic disorder too which can be confirmed only after delivery . is it possible for me to terminate the pregnancy right now ?,2,7499,"hi there,please do not be so tensed, having been told that you are going to lose your baby must be a devastating experience. but nothing is confirmed till a definitive test such as an amniocentesis is done. a transvaginal ultrasound does not cause any damage to the lining of the uterus or to the pregnancy, do not be very concerned about it causing harm. if some defects were identified on the ultrasound we will need to rule if they are isolated or associated with a genetic cause such as a trisomy. the amniocentesis will take some fluid from around the baby and analyze it for the dna. but if the baby does have a genetic defect it is also more likely to miscarry itself, which could be a cause of the constant mild spotting you have already had through this pregnancy. if the amniocentesis comes out with a normal finding and there are still defects observed on the ultrasound, you will need to get detailed scans at 20 weeks and a cardiac echo of the baby at 22-24 weeks to rule out other problems if any. hope this helps. regards."
hi am in 21 weeks of pregnancy . with recent ultrasound test amniocentesis test i found my baby has bilateral cleft lip and doctors say that the child might have genetic disorder too which can be confirmed only after delivery . is it possible for me to terminate the pregnancy right now ?,3,29625,"hi, amniocentesis is a definitive test and can tell for sure if the baby has downs or not. if you are very anxious about downs, it will be the investigation of choice for you, especially since now you are 15 weeks, you can go for amniocentesis at 16 weeks. the first trimester blood test, nuclei scan and the second trimester triple test are only screening tests, so even if the double marker at 11 weeks is 95% accurate it can just say the risk. a sure result can only be done by amniocentesis at 16 weeks for you. but please also do remember that amniocentesis has a 1/100 risk of miscarriage, and you should be aware of this before undergoing the procedure.41 years in itself is a high risk for downs, considering an amniocentesis could be beneficial to you. please consult a good fetal medicine expert for the amniocentesis. hope this helps. regards."

"respected doctor , by son aged 18 yrs is under allopathic treatment for ocd for the last two and half years . recently he was showing some symptoms of schizophrenia also and was given medicine accordingly.since in allopathy they are treating the symptoms , a am in doubt about its efficacy in long run.while taking allopatchatdoctoredicine he has become very dull and weak emotionally.kindly guide . a.k.gupta jaipur",1,15522,"hello, welcome to chat doctor. thanks for posting your question at this forum. we understand your concern. i am chat doctor psychiatry from india. i will guide you about your daughters' health. whatever information you have given here about your daughter, point towards a serious long-lasting mental illness of psychosis like schizophrenia. i must explain you in simpler way. schizophrenia is a psychotic illness in which the person has abnormal perception, absurd thinking, decline of higher mental function, deterioration in social and occupational functioning and significant personal sufferings for years. the patient may claim to hear unusual voices which others deny hearing. this is called auditory hallucination. initially the voices come for a short period and the person feels strange and does not understand what to do. he/ she gradually may start believing on those voices as frequency and intensity of voices increases with passage of time. often these voices comment/discuss derogatory about the person and sometimes these may suggest or command the person to do certain act. sometimes the person may harm herself/ himself sunder the influence of these voices. as you have experienced, she has a self-talking behavior since last many years, has harmed herself once and now she is claiming a clear two-way conversation with that voice. it appears that she is having auditory hallucination(auditory hallucination is one of the commonest symptoms in psychosis like schizophrenia), and apparently these voices are unpleasant or commanding in nature that might have provoked the episode of self harm in the past. since the onset of symptoms is in childhood and has been continuing for years it shows poor awareness of caregiver about the symptoms of illness. it is never too late. you must consult a good child and adolescent psychiatrist and encourage your daughter to discuss her symptoms honestly so that the diagnosis can be finalized. if i had been her doctor, i would have advice her for brain imaging, certain other investigations, to take some antipsychotic medicines under supervision of a family member and to attend psycho-educative classes regularly. medicines and supportive therapy can bring remission to illness. hope this has helped you. i wish you all the best."

"pm a breast cancer survivor who successfully survived a 3.9 pm tutor with surgery , chemo , and radiation in 2008 . about a month ago , my husband was diagnosed with stage 3 throat cancer ( they found evidence of disease in at least one lymph node ) . be has had both tonsils removed , and this is the second time he has had cancer . is first bout of throat cancer was in 2006 , and an aggressive tonsillectomy was done , but that was all . to consult with an oncologist or anything . a guess my question is is this a survivable condition , and a truly need an honest answer . by husband is 54 years old and otherwise very healthy .",1,90747,"hi, thanks for writing in. many people end up with a second cancer with a history of having been treated for an earlier cancer with radiation therapy. however, at that time, providing radiation therapy had more benefits and risks and has helped in treating the testicular cancer and your husband has been free from symptoms almost 25 years. plasma cell dysplasia can be seen in such patients but saying with confirmation that it is indeed the radiation that is responsible is difficult. radiation effects are both dose dependent and non dose dependent. if your husband was exposed to radiation in error at his workplace then things would have been different but in the present case he has been given radiation therapy as a treatment and that has been successful to a certain extent. there are also patients who develop a second cancer that is unrelated to the first cancer. to know the chances of the prior radiation treatment causing the plasma cell dysplasia, all his medical records have to be verified and that will only give a risk. it cannot be said with certainty that the radiation given 25 years back is completely responsible for his present health condition."

am 37 or . i have lost my baby for 8 month 23 days during pregnancy i have pod . can i conceive again . now i am taking follicular test and result is my follicle is msf the day of 12 of 15. ply ans me,1,51936,"hi, yes pregnancy is possible after rupture of the follicle. in fact pregnancy is possible only after rupture of the follicle. now let me explain you this. a follicle ruptures to release egg. usually the eggs released from the follicles of size between 18 mm and 21 mm are the healthiest eggs having maximum possibility of successful pregnancy. an egg has a life of 24 hours while the sperms are active for 3 days. hence, sexual intercourse even 3 days before the rupture of a follicle (or release of an egg) can cause pregnancy. since the egg has a life of 24 hours, sexual intercourse within 24 hours of the rupture of follicle can result into pregnancy. i am sure that now you are convinced that unless the follicle is ruptured, egg cannot be released and thus pregnancy is not possible. the pregnancy is possible only after rupture of a follicle. from your history, it appears that you had sexual relations on the day of the follicular rupture, so you have maximum chances of pregnancy. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."
am 37 or . i have lost my baby for 8 month 23 days during pregnancy i have pod . can i conceive again . now i am taking follicular test and result is my follicle is msf the day of 12 of 15. ply ans me,2,13108,"hi, i appreciate your query would clarify the report of your follicular study to you. on the 9th day, in the right and left ovaries (of and lof) - there was no df - which means, dominant follicle. again the same findings persisted till the 13th day, that is there was no dominant follicle in any of the ovaries. et - refers to endometrial thickness which was 8 mm on day 13. collection in pod was nil, which is normal. now, to explain a normal follicular study to you. by day 9, the ovaries start producing dominant follicles, that is among the many eggs present in the ovaries, one starts maturing to develop into the dominant egg for that month. by day 13 generally, if you have a regular 28-day menstrual cycle, the dominant egg reaches a size of 20 - 22 mm. generally on day 14, ovulation occurs, that is the mature dominant egg is released from the ovary, and it is then ready for fertilization by the sperm. this is the normal studyhowever, in your case, there is no dominant follicle seen till day 13, which means that you are having an ovulatory cycle. that is, no mature egg is developing for ovulation this month. anovulatory cycles are a major cause for not being able to conceive.pod (polycystic ovarian disease) is one of the leading causes of an ovulation, apart from other conditions. you need to consult a gynecologist, and undergo further investigations for pod to rule out the cause of this follicular study. also, you might require treatment and ovulation induction (medicines to stimulate formation of follicles in the ovary). in case your cycles are delayed (longer than 28 - 30 days), there is a minor possibility that your follicles are maturing later than normal, for e.g., in a 35-day cycle, the day of ovulation would be 14 days before periods, that is on day 20 or 21. hope this helped you."
