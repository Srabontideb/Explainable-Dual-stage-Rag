"a was stung by a bark scorpion 7 days ago . not a big deal . just very painful and felt like broken glass would come in my arm in waves . the place of injection is still numb , and today it is looking very swollen . a did to notice much swelling before today . it also itches slightly . is this normal ? and is there any reason for concern ?",1,97794,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. even though there is an expiration date on the implant, for medical safety and medications are devices that expire still have some function in them beyond the expiration date. so there is a very strong possibility that if you are not menstruating your implant is actually still providing contraception. furthermore, the side effects of the implant can be similar to pregnancy, as the hormone in the implant in certain ways tricks your body to thinking that your pregnant in order to provide contraception. so at this time, it is most likely the implant is still preventing pregnancy. eventually, the usual way you will find out that the implant has worn off is that your menstrual period will begin again. however, if you strongly do not desire pregnancy i suggest you use a backup method of contraception just in case. there is no reason to believe that you are infertile while you on birth control. until the birth control is completely out of your system, there is no way to know about whether you can conceive. if you are otherwise healthy and under the age of 35 and at regular menstrual cycles before you got the implant, there is no reason to suspect that you would have problems with fertility once the birth control is out of your system. the rod should be removed when you can, as the device was not tested for integrity in your arm much beyond the expiration date. in the united states, planned parenthood offers low-cost and free birth control management and would be a good place to investigate for removal of your implant at an affordable rate. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

hello so i was wondering i have the birth control implosion in my arm my doctor see it was good for two years . a was wondering what could be the signs of it wherein off ? and if i were to keep it in and not get it taken out would it do anything ? would it be bad to keep it in and get pregnant later on ? one more thing so i got it in 2011 its 2014 and i never had a period on it but this last year i have been having periods not light blood but dark and about a medium amount of blood is that a sign its wherein out or is my body getting rid of old blood ? pleas help me thanks,1,108096,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. it is true that theoretically you should have been clear of the injection within three months of discontinuation, however many women after being a depo-provera for a long time do not resume having ovulatory, regular, menstrual cycles until 6 to 9 months or even up to a year after discontinuation. unfortunately, it is difficult to artificially induce ovulation in women who are coming off depo-provera. if you were not trying to become pregnant, your cycle could be regulated temporarily with birth control pills, but if you're actually trying to get pregnant the best thing you can do with this point is to just keep trying and wait and see. if you feel any symptoms of pregnancy, and you haven't gotten your period for a while, i would do pregnancy test just to make sure. there is always a possibility even if your periods are not regular that you do ovulate sometimes. so in summary, continue having unprotected sex every other to every three days and give it some more time. 80% of couples will conceive within one year, and if after a year of trying you and your partner are unsuccessful, it might be a good idea to see a fertility specialist for an evaluation. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes, and good luck getting pregnant,"

okay a got my first birth control shot january 3 and 3 months pasted by a had to get my second shot the beginning of april and a was late 19 days a got the shot april 20 and after a got the shot a had sex with my boyfriend and he netted in me 2 times do you think a might me pregnant,1,15745,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. first, if you are late for your shot and have had unprotected sex, even if you are bleeding, you should do a urine pregnancy test. if your pregnancy test is negative, many women do not have regular periods come back after discontinuing the depo-provera injection for even up to 6 months. this, however, does not mean that you cannot become pregnant. if you are not actively trying to get pregnant, a good way to help regulate your cycles until your own body resumes a regular cycle is by taking birth control pills. birth control pills make you get a light, regular, predictable cycle every month and will help control breakthrough bleeding (the brown staining you have all the time). many women have irregular bleeding in the first 6 months to a year of using the shot, and unfortunately the same thing can happen after you discontinue it. so, in summary, all the irregular bleeding you are having is likely due to your discontinuing the demo shot. if you need contraception, the monthly cycle birth control pill would be a good option that can also help you have regular cycles. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"a have been having heaviness and tingling especially on my left side of my side . have seen a neurologist , but he could not find anything . it has been happening for the past 10 years . sometimes , when it is severe , a feel like a am going to get a stroke . a have visited the emergency room several times out caution , but nothing happens . that do you think is my condition ? thanks .",1,90927,"hi, i am chat doctor. i have read your message. i think i can help you. first, the symptoms that you have described are highly suggestive of seizures. here is why- 1. they come in night-seizures are commonly triggered when the patient sleeps or just around the sleep. of course, they can occur at other times too.2. they start from the leg and move up and then spread to the rest of the body.3. the episodes last 3-4 minutes and then resolves. i assume (you have not mentioned it) that it is never remembered by him, the episode that is. i think you should both take it very seriously. there is a high possibility that there is an intracranial problem that he is having which is extending and progressing undetected in the brain just because you do not want to visit a neurologist. i think you should meet a neurologist as soon as possible and request an mri brain (with spectroscopy if needed) and video eeg. if he does turn out to have a pathology, treatment will have to be initiated for the pathology in addition to regular anti-epileptic medicines. i suggest taking a video of these episodes that he is having. it may help convince him that he needs to visit a doctor, and it may be helpful to the doctor in seeing the condition that your husband has. yes, you need to visit a neurologist as soon as possible. ideally, i would also like to know if he has been having headaches for the past years? does he seem to be having episodes where he does not recollect what he has been doing for a certain duration of time? you may need to talk to his colleagues at work and find out if he has been having seizures or any abnormal behavior at work. there is a high chance that he knows that he has been having seizures at work and not telling you about it. i have tried my best to help you. unfortunately, i cannot initiate / suggest medicines as long as the diagnosis is not confirmed because the anti-epileptics may have severe side effects. best of luck,"

i was stupid i know but i took some cocaine with an old school friend ( this was the first and only time i have done it ) then had unprotected sex and now my girlfriend is pregnant i have read this will harm my baby is there anything i can do to stop this ?,1,87829,"hif you have had sex on the ovulation day, then pregnancy test can be done on the 7th day after sex. the logic is implantation of baby into uterus occurs on the 6th-7th day after ovulation. with implantation, pregnancy hormone is secreted, and it can be detected by tests. this is the earliest time to do pregnancy test. urine test may not detect it. you need to do blood pregnancy test. so only when you have sex at the time /just after ovulation pregnancy test can be done after 6-7 days. what you have heard is right. the first week and the last week of a menstrual cycle are safe. a woman cannot get pregnant if she has unprotected sex during this period. i hope i have answered your concerns."
i was stupid i know but i took some cocaine with an old school friend ( this was the first and only time i have done it ) then had unprotected sex and now my girlfriend is pregnant i have read this will harm my baby is there anything i can do to stop this ?,2,22940,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, the depo-provera injection becomes immediately effective against pregnancy the day you get the shot. the reason why it is recommended for you to start taking demo while you have your period is to make sure that you have not already become pregnant and get the injection while pregnant. so if you had a shot two weeks ago, even if you had a condom accident, and especially since you took morning-after pill, there is no reason to suspect that you are risk for pregnancy. however, a urinary tract infection, which is inflammation of the bladder, can occur after sex if chafing during sex especially externally rubs bacteria into the urethra (the urinary opening). this is common in women who use condoms as the ring on the condom can irritate this area during penetration. so i think you can be reassured that your symptoms are not due to pregnancy. however, i think you most likely do have a uti and should visit your local physician or clinic for evaluation, so you can get a prescription for antibiotics to treat it. if you are now going to be having unprotected sex with your current partner, you both should be tested for stds to make sure that you are not at risk of giving anything to one another. however, this point there is no evidence that your symptoms could be caused by an std. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

hey me and my husband we a trying for 6 months to have a baby . but unsuccessful .can a tell wat is the best position to conceive and also so tips for getting pregnant faster . one more thing i int feel orgasm easily i int find much pleasure in doing intercourse is it necessary to feel orgasm by female to get pregnant,2,108096,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. it is true that theoretically you should have been clear of the injection within three months of discontinuation, however many women after being a depo-provera for a long time do not resume having ovulatory, regular, menstrual cycles until 6 to 9 months or even up to a year after discontinuation. unfortunately, it is difficult to artificially induce ovulation in women who are coming off depo-provera. if you were not trying to become pregnant, your cycle could be regulated temporarily with birth control pills, but if you're actually trying to get pregnant the best thing you can do with this point is to just keep trying and wait and see. if you feel any symptoms of pregnancy, and you haven't gotten your period for a while, i would do pregnancy test just to make sure. there is always a possibility even if your periods are not regular that you do ovulate sometimes. so in summary, continue having unprotected sex every other to every three days and give it some more time. 80% of couples will conceive within one year, and if after a year of trying you and your partner are unsuccessful, it might be a good idea to see a fertility specialist for an evaluation. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes, and good luck getting pregnant,"

a have intercourse 2 says after my period ended and since my boyfriend thought a am less likely to ovulate at this time he ejaculated inside me twice . a did take plan a the next day but a was very nauseated and a am having some white discharge . would a be pregnant ?,1,77227,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, i want to clarify, if you are virgin and have not had sexual intercourse or ejaculation directly in the opening of your vagina, your chance of pregnancy is really nonexistent. sperm die when exposed to air, so there is no way that you can become pregnant from sperm that ejaculated outside the vagina. furthermore, is very uncommon to find women who ovulate during their menstrual cycle. therefore, you were most likely not at the fertile time of your cycle when you and your boyfriend had genital contact. furthermore, irregular bleeding can be caused by travel, changes in weight, hormonal imbalances and stress, especially the stress of worrying about getting pregnant. just because your period was light this month does not mean that there was anything wrong. now omens menstrual cycle is exactly the same every month, and as long as you got a period at the usual time, there is no reason to suspect pregnancy if the bleeding was different in quality than what you usually see. so i think that it is fine to be reassured that you did not conceive from this encounter with your boyfriend. if you continue to have irregular menstrual cycles for more than three months, you may want to visit your local physician as some hormonal imbalances can cause these problems and should be tested for. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was reassuring. best wishes,"

"i , ave been on birth control for a long time , with my doctors proposition , she wanted me to skip the iron/sugar pills every four months . to basically a only have one real period every four months ... to help with my pms . -- of , a this was the month a was supposed to have my period . to a stopped my pill when a finished the pack , and had a normal period ... three days into my period , a had sex with my boyfriend ... a took a pill the morning after we had sex ... because a had just refilled my prescription the prior night .... to a have a chance of being pregnant ? ? or do you think pm okay ? ?",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

a noticed a red like object that seemed to be hanging on by a little thread of gum in the back of my gums towards my wisdom teeth today and it seems to be apart of my gums a picked at it and it started to bleed a little and a noticed that it looked like it was rooted into my gums . is this something to be worried about ?,1,66577,"hi. thanks for the query. swelling of the gums can be due to infection of the gums, but in case if the gums are inflamed only around the wisdom tooth then it can be due to peritonitis that is an inflammation of the gum flap over the wisdom tooth. so you should consult an oral physician and get evaluated. in case if there is generalized gum swelling then it can be due to gum infection that can be due to gingivitis or periodontitis. in that case cleaning of the gums that is scaling can be done followed by a course of antibiotics and gum paint massage. if it is due to peritonitis then localized cleaning of gum and a course of antibiotics and painkillers and doing warm saline gargles can help. hope this helps. regards."
a noticed a red like object that seemed to be hanging on by a little thread of gum in the back of my gums towards my wisdom teeth today and it seems to be apart of my gums a picked at it and it started to bleed a little and a noticed that it looked like it was rooted into my gums . is this something to be worried about ?,2,53390,hi. can understand your concern. as per your complaint the swollen gum and the white material inside it is a result of some inflammation. there can be a few reasons depending upon whether it is the second molar or the wisdom tooth. in case it is a wisdom tooth which is erupting or is impacted then the gum above it can get infected and inflamed due to either food deposition between the gum and the wisdom tooth or it can be due to gum flap bitten by the opposite jaw tooth and the condition is known as peritonitis. the white material in it is pus. in case it is second molar the swollen gum with white material in it can be as a result of infection in the gums due to deposits on the teeth like plaque or calculus or due to foreign body impaction in the gums which carries infection along with it deeper into the gums causing pus formation. it can also be due to deeply infected tooth causing pus formation below the tips of the roots of the tooth causing swelling on the gums with pus inside. i would suggest you to consult a dentist and get evaluated for the exact cause of the swelling and get treated accordingly. in case if it is wisdom tooth either excision of gum flap or extraction if the tooth is impacted followed by antibiotics and painkillers can be done. in case of gum infection professional cleaning of teeth followed by antibiotics and gum paints can help. in case of tooth infection root canal treatment or extraction depending on the condition of the tooth can be done. hope your query is solved. if you find the answer helpful please write a positive review and click on find this answer helpful as a token of appreciation. thanks and regards. chat doctor.

hi my name is crystal i have a quick question i was on the demo 2 years then off it 8 months before i got back on it . i received one injection then decided i want to try to get pregnant . how long will this process take . i was off the demo last year in july then became pregnant in august but miss carried the doctors said i became pregnant fast after having the shoot 2 years . i just am feeling discouraged now its been hard to conceive again,1,9011,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. since you have been pregnant before, there is no reason to expect that you should not be able to conceive spontaneously after going off the demo proverb. the fact that you terminated your pregnancies does not have any long term effects on your ability to conceive, and demo, once it is out of your system, does not have any bearing on your fertility or ability to have a healthy child. certainly there is no reason to delay trying to get pregnant if that is what you and your partner desire. however, sometimes it can take 6 months to even a year after stopping demo for your ovulation to return consistently, so if you do not conceive easily right away, there is no reason to be concerned. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful. best wishes,"

"a have of but also a compressed disc or two in my back . lately , a have been unable to maintain walking long distances and sometimes my upper body is hard to maintain . by posture is off and a walk with a limp . it feels like one leg is longer sometimes . an a exercise to improve my walking ?",1,5481,"hi there, im sorry to hear about the medical problems your father is having. when i hear the symptoms that your father is having, the first thing that comes to my mind is claudication. claudication is pain while walking due to arterial insufficiency- basically, the muscles in the legs don't get enough blood flow when they are being used, and they start to ache. this is caused by peripheral vascular disease and is common in smokers, diabetics, and patients with high cholesterol levels. these patients will often have a history of coronary artery disease and sometimes renal problems as well. the first thing i would recommend is for your father to start a waking regiment and walk consistently every day. he should aim to walk for about 30 minutes a day. if he cants do 30 minutes, he should do as much as he can, and then try to do a little more each day. the most important thing is daily consistency - he has to do it every day, not just one or two times a week. i'd also recommend he check his cholesterol levels, and if they are high a statin such as lipitor (atorvastatin) can help lower his levels and prevent further damage. finally, if he continues to have problems with walking after 6 months of a dedicated walking problem, then he should see a vascular surgeon and have his arterial vessels looked at in his leg with ultrasound. i hope this is helpful. please contact me with any questions."

hi a am trying to conceive for last 1 and a half yr. my reports are all normal and my ovulation test was normal with an endometrium at 9mm thickness . a have a daughter 6 years old and was a caesarean baby . my fallopian tubes are perfect . active motile sperm count is 20 %,1,86374,"dear member, thanks for writing to chat doctor .your concerns are valid. unprotected coitus over a period of three years would have usually caused a pregnancy. if you have irregular cycles which is common in teens then ovulation and pregnancy may not occur. as you enter your twenties and cycles regularize you may conceive. another reason may be unprotected coitus causing infection and blocking the fallopian tubes. also remember the male partner also has to have a normal semen parameters with adequate sperm count and motility if the partner has to become pregnant. i would recommend that protection from infection by using a barrier should be your priority now as you ate not trying for a baby now. thanks. chat doctor."

i have cirrhosis of the liver due to hepatitis c. about five days ago i started with a itchy body rash . it started on stomach and inner thighs . today i notice it underneath my forearm . according to my doctor i am i liver failure . is this rash part of my liver problem and if so how can i treat it .,1,5256,"hi, how are you? my name is chat doctor. thanks for writing to chat doctor and i hope to answer your question today. hepatitis c virus, as i am sure you are aware, damages the liver cells. the liver has an enormous capacity to regenerate, meaning if part of the liver is damaged, then new liver cells are formed to replace the damaged liver (unlike skin where damaged skin is replaced by scar). the problem with hepatitis c is, it is present constantly in the blood and liver and continues to damage the liver continuously. just like a rubber band can be stretched only so far before it snaps, so is the regenerative capacity of the liver. depending on how virulent the hepatitis c strain is, over the course of 10-30 yrs, the liver exhausts its capacity to regenerate and just like skin, the damaged liver cells starts getting replaced by scar tissue - this leads to hardening of the normal supple liver - a condition known as liver fibrosis which later on leads to liver cirrhosis. the problem with this is, under normal circumstances anywhere between 1200 and 1500 ml of blood flows through the liver per min. when the liver is normal and supple, this blood can flow easily through the liver. but when the liver begins to stiffen or harden as in the case of cirrhosis, this blood is met with great resistance during its flow through the liver. this is called as ""portal hypertension"". so the blood starts to look for alternate routes to return to the heart and the most accessible route for it is through the veins of the food pipe (esophagus and stomach). the problem with this is, the veins in the esophagus and stomach are very thin walled and are not used to carrying this much volume of blood. so they distend to a great degree (a condition called as varices) and sometime even rupture with catastrophic consequences. this is easily diagnosed by upper gi endoscopy where the largely dilated veins can be seen. but in your case, since multiple upper gi endoscopies have not demonstrated any varices, it means your liver has not reached a state of ""portal hypertension"" yet and the disease seems not be progressing or is ""stable"". if i was your doctor, i would also get a ""fibrosis"" which is a special scan of the liver to look at the amount of stiffness or hardening of the liver. this can be repeated regularly to see the progression of the fibrosis. i would also explore the different treatments for hepatitis c infection. the gold standard is of course a liver biopsy which will demonstrate the exact status of your liver. i hope this helped, and i do hope you will get better soon. please write back to me if you need any further clarifications especially the treatment options available to treat hepatitis c. have a great day"

"hello sir , i have got my wisdom teeth extracted for around 6 months but still get my cheeks swallowed whenever i eat through that side , and then an when i stopped eating from that side swelling reduces . after extraction swelling lasts for only 4-5 days then it was normal.i int think its infection as i int feel pus in my mouth , but i do get a bit of internal fever and weakness.i done know wat to do , .plz help",1,27231,"hi. welcome to chat doctor . i have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. as per your complaint in case if you have pain related to wisdom teeth there is a possibility that they are impacted and there is also a possibility that the gum flap over the wisdom tooth is inflamed leading to peritonitis and causing toothache as well as radiating pain to head. as you are advised for extraction of the wisdom teeth, you should go ahead with it but get it extracted only by an experienced oral surgeon. as the wisdom teeth are rudimentary and does not participate in chewing, therefore extraction will not cause and difficulty in eating as well as if done properly there are no post extraction complications too. there can be some pain and swelling after extraction that will be controlled with anti-inflammatory painkillers and antibiotics will be advised to you to avoid infection. so my suggestion will be to get extraction done by a trained oral surgeon and follow the instructions that will be given post extraction for avoiding any complications. hope this information helps. thanks and regards. chat doctor."

"i or oahu , a am diego abuse a a 24 years old and a a about to start on birth control , a be chosen falcon , a a just not sure when to start taking it , because at the pharmacy where a bought them a was told a can start immediately , however on their website it says that one should start on the first day of their cycle , a assume that means on the day a start my next period . please help thank you",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"hey , when i went to go eat lunch today it didst feel right swallowing and i guess i started to freak out and i started getting these pains in my like lower chest , upper stomach area , and any time i go to eat or drink something i get these reoccurring",2,77258,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the sensation of feeling something stuck in your throat is a symptom of reflux-when the food that you eat or the acid in your stomach can back up and irritate it. this is common when you have a large belly at full term because your stomach is being pushed up towards your chest and also the hormones from the pregnancy cause the top opening of your stomach that connects to your esophagus to be looser, so food and acid can leak more easily. the best way to try to control this is to eat only small amounts at one time and to make sure you sit up for at least 2 hours after meals. taking antacids, which for the most part are all safe during pregnancy, can also help. trying to cough up what you feel in your throat will not help because there is not actually something solid coming up. these symptoms may be difficult to treat, but the good news is the symptoms will get better after you have the baby. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"
"hey , when i went to go eat lunch today it didst feel right swallowing and i guess i started to freak out and i started getting these pains in my like lower chest , upper stomach area , and any time i go to eat or drink something i get these reoccurring",3,94135,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. many women get pain in their chest from reflux or gastritis. when your stomach starts to secrete acid, like when you eat, the pain may get worse. acid reflux literally means that the acid from your stomach sloshes up into your esophagus, and that can cause it to spasm, which you are feeling when you lie down. taking your german at the full adult dose (150 mg) daily will gradually help the symptoms, but i also suggest you purchase a calcium-containing antacid (like tums) and take two whenever you feel the spasms or pain in your shoulder. trying to only eat upright and staying upright at least 2 hours after eating will help to reduce the reflux as well. if you always feel the pain when you lie down, try to prop yourself up on pillows, so your head is higher than the rest of your body. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"i the last cycle of my started at 22july she supposed to be get cycle by today , we did the urine test and it shows positive . we are confused the pregnancy line is very fade .. is she pregnant , and what should we do if do want to go with this pregnancy ? ? ?",1,35396,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. if you have not yet missed your period, even if you are pregnant, the line will appear very faint on the pregnancy test as your hormone levels are extremely low at this time in pregnancy. so there is no reason to assume that the test was wrong as the greatest likelihood is that you are actually pregnant. however, women can have a situation where they have a positive pregnancy test and then get their normal period on time. this is known as a chemical pregnancy and is caused by the situation where the egg is fertilized but never implants into the uterus and continues to grow. so i encourage patients in general to try to avoid performing pregnancy test before they actually miss their period, as even though you have a positive pregnancy test this early, it does not guarantee that the pregnancy is going to take. if your cycle is late, there is no reason to assume that there is any problem with the pregnancy. if you do retest after you miss your period and the line is still very weekly positive, it may be reasonable to see a physician and get a blood test for the level of your pregnancy hormone. pregnancy hormone levels are supposed to double every 48 hours so by the time you miss your period the levels should be significantly high enough to produce a clear double line on the pregnancy test especially if you perform it with your first morning urine as recommended. low hormone levels in early pregnancy can indicate that the pregnancy is not developing properly or that it can be an ectopic or tubal pregnancy, which needs to be diagnosed and accurately managed by a physician. in the meantime however, i encourage you to stop chat doctor. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes and good luck with the pregnancy,"

"a have shingles and no health insurance . a still have some amoxicillin sitting in my fridge that hast expired . will it help with the shingles ? ave had shingles before so pm sure the signs a have mean a have it . a have a constant headache , fatigue and a small rash that is identical to the rash a had when a had shingles last time .",1,14849,"shingles isn't contagious unless you haven't had chickenpox. what happens is you get chickenpox, usually as a child, then the virus goes dormant in the body. years later it can break out in a localized rash as shingles. so shingles itself can't be transmitted. however, since it is the same virus that causes chickenpox, if someone has not had chickenpox or been immunized for it, they can get it from the shingles patient who has the rash. so unless someone is susceptible that way, there is no reason to have her stay home, especially since she has no rash and the doctor isn't even sure yet. if she does get a rash, she can keep it covered while she is working with a bandage, and then with her shirt over that. things should be okay that way. frequent handwashing is important for her and everyone else as well. hope this helps."

"i , i have a problem regarding foot fingers . they became so dark . when i started applying modern cream on doctor a advice . after using it for a couple of times , slowly i felt itching on my fingers . it became so severe now .. so , am in confusion whether to continue the medicine or not .... so , please let me know or valuable advice regarding this .. regards",1,11676,"hi, thanks for writing to us. firstly it is important to know whether the darkness of toes or fingers is a primary phenomenon, or it occurred secondarily to some eczema, chill plains etc. so that a proper treatment can be offered. modern is an emollient or a moisturizing cream, and it would rarely induce itching. to relieve itching, take tablet cetirizine and apply a steroid cream like dexamethasone or mometasone. once the itching is gone, pigmentation can be reduced with an emollient cream containing glycolic acid, urea etc. (medina cream) hope that helps"

(regular use of emergency pill is harmful)conception occurs if she was in 10th to 18th day of her cycle(in a regular cycle of 28 day duration). you can ask her at what day she is in and wait for next cycle to occur. if it delayed by 7 days then get done upt to diagnose if pregnant and then the required treatment can be taken. regards"

"what would a person feel if he died of a brain aneurysm ? by brother collapsed on the floor of the bathroom in the middle of the night , and it seemed like he took 2 strained inhales and then nothing . paramedics weren't able to get a pulse and didst even take him to the hospital . now did they know ?",1,95688,"hello, im very sorry to hear about your friends stroke. here is some information relation to hemorrhagic strokes (brain bleeds).first, brain bleeds can happen for different reasons such as a head injury (traumatic), a rupture of an aneurysm and bleed within the brain matter itself (parenchymal hemorrhage). it is very important in your friends' case to determine what caused his bleed. given his fevers any infections need to be ruled out and an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) should be done to rule out any sort of infection of the heart valves which could send bacteria to the brain which could result in a bleed. he absolutely needs to have blood vessel imaging in the form of either a ct angiogram and mr angiogram to make sure that there are no abnormal collections of blood vessels in the brain and aneurysms that could have cause the bleed. also, when there is a bleed in the brain a tumor must also be ruled out. all that being said, the most common cause of a bleed in the brain is due to high blood pressure which causes weakening of blood vessels and can result in a hemorrhage. most commonly management of brain hemorrhages is supportive, meaning that the only things that are done is blood pressure control, pain management and if the person is unconscious then support for breathing. if the bleed is very large then surgical intervention may be necessary. what the doctors are saying as that they want to repeat a ct scan to see if the bleed has become larger, which can sometimes happen. there are several risk factors for the bleed worsening: one is poor blood pressure control, another is if there is an underlying aneurysm or blood vessel that could bleed. that's why it is so important to determine what caused the bleed. for small bleeds with no underlying vascular or malignant pathology the outcome is typically fairly good. the blood causes irritation and pressure on the surrounding brain causing weakness and neurological symptoms, but as the blood subsides the symptoms improve and sometimes there may be a remarkable improvement. the language area of the brain is very delicate, and it is hard to predict how well he will recover, but my best educated guess is that he will recover at least some language function and could even recover close to how he was though probably never quite back to level his language was before the bleed. it sounds like he is doing relatively well overall since he is able to go to the restroom without support, so that is an encouraging sign. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

be are trying to conceive and my husband has a liquefaction time greater than 60 minutes and a high pm level from his semen analysis . be has taken antibiotics and there is no sign of infection . be has had 3 semen analysis done and results stay the same .,1,26146,"hellothanks for query. based on the facts that you have posted you are married since 3.5 years and have not been able to impregnate your wife. your semen analysis has revealed liquefaction time of your semen to be more than one hour. consistency of semen immediately on ejaculation is thick and viscous hence the sperms are unable to move forward, however the semen ejaculated gradually gets liquefied by an enzyme called psa which is produced by prostate. this liquefied semen enables sperms to move forward in vagina and uterine cavity towards fallopian tubes for effective fertilization of female egg to result into pregnancy. in the majority of cases the cause for increase in liquefaction time is infection which needs to be eradicated. taking antibiotics like doxycycline twice daily for 4-6 weeks does help to reduce liquefaction time to normal level of 30 -40 minutes and there by in conception., chat doctor."

"that is it when a heart stings after having palpitations ? pm a trying to have a heart attack ? a a overweight 5 3 about 166lbs . bi-polar disorder , acid reflux are all my problems . but the palpitations were different and certainly the stinging sensation .",1,88858,"hello and thank you for using chat doctor. i carefully read your question and i understand your concern. i will try to explain you something and give you some advises. as you describe my opinion is that we are dealing with a rhythm issue. someone might feel heart palpitations for different reasons. it may be a simple sinus tachycardia that means that the heart is beating regularly over 100 beats for minute. its normal resting rate is between 60-100 beat for minute. you may experience palpitations because of extra-sistolyc beats. these is electrical impulses generating from parts of the heart different from normal sinus rhythm. this gives the sensation of an escaped, skipping beat. but there are all sow different rhythm problems like atrial fibrillation ore supra ventricular tachycardia where the heart doesn't beat normal, it suddenly beats fast or in a chaotic way with very high frequencies and this might be what we call atrial fibrillation. my opinion is that lifting weight is not the reason of your palpitations. it's quite known in cardiology that during physical exertion the heart rate raises. its maximal frequency should go 220 minus your age, and it should slowly go down. but you describe a long history of palpitations and a sudden heart jumping just for some seconds, immediately chat doctor. so, i think that we should see what are these rhythm fluctuations. does this happen even in a resting situation or only when you exercise? if i was your treating doctor i will recommend a blood analyze, your thyroid hormones, an electrocardiography, echocardiogram and of course a holder monitoring to see your rhythm tendency. ones we have all these we can say what are these palpitations and how to treat them.these is all for a simple check-up to reduce these episodes in the future. whish i was helpful. take good care. best regards"

"a am 49 years old . a am 150lbs with an height of 5 2 inches . while sleeping a strained my neck and found a lump at the side of my neck , a to is not painful but a am very concern . the swelling has gone down slightly but remain there until now .",1,24397,"there are quite a long list of other therapies for the pain. the operation issue intrigues me because the shoulder and the back are not connected. and the shoulder if it is the part down below the neck is inside the chest and doesn't get much wear and tear. if it is at the neck, then neck disk disease is very, very common and almost always shows up on regular x-rays. but. has nothing to do with back and legs in the vast majority. back to pain management: there are multiple levels. obviously the first level is what is broken and fixing it with the surgery. the second level is the pain produced from the problem. nerve pills sometimes work. muscle relaxants sometimes work. amitriptyline is both a nerve pill (like lidocaine) and a blocker of pain signals at the spine. the third level is the context in which the pain is held. while lately everyone is talking about mindfulness and yoga, frankly you might as well try a fidget spinner. i am highly dubious about all of them. but, having the pain be directed by oneself and having it decrease is known to be among the most effective modulators of pain. so, if you can do exercise or physical therapy in the context of making it painful, then the pain experience is less after creating the pain and with repeating it the pain goes down (except during the physical therapy where it goes up for the first 2 months then stabilizes but is still painful)."

hi my self harsh from bangalore .. in 2006 i meet with an accident and my regiment was injured .. the i consulted doc and got mri scanning ... doc said there is no any serious injury just have physiotherapy treatment even after phythrpy there was lot of pain cant make leg straight ... and even i had ayurveda treatment for 2weeks .. treatment thy gave was some oil message later after that there was no pain but in i try to make may leg straight the is some cracking sensation in the keen ... can a plus advice wat is the precaution i have to take .. thank a,1,73387,"hi there! my name is vinay. let me see if i can give you some peace of mind here. mris all depend on magnets! no radiation and they are pretty harmless. the only thing you have to make sure is that you have no implants that could be attracted by the magnet in the machine. when i was in residency in colorado, the duty doc room used to be taken up by my chief and his girlfriend. so i used to sleep in the mri machine!! it was the only flat surface other than the gurneys in the er. so don't worry, the mri is harmless. now the scar tissue at the operative site should not be causing any headaches as its not under pressure and brain tissue can't feel normal sensations like pain. if you are having headaches. look into any problems with the scalp wound or the bone (skull) that they had to go through during the surgery. scar tissue can hypertrophy (grow in size) over time, but its really rare and really, really slow. so the mris will catch it if it does. not to worry there. so relax, the scar tissue is harmless and so is the mri. make sure you get those scans done just as the doctors tell you too! congratulations on beating back the gbm! i wish you the best of luck!"

""b"" these devices are great for grinding. i prefer hard night guards because the firmness helps prevent them from breaking down and they don't flex like soft night guards which in your sleep may be perceived as food and induce more grinding. i personally use a night guard and found that it has improved my bruise condition greatly. they are well worth the money. best regards and good health"

"well a am currently on implants for birth control but a do know there is risk of pregnancy . a am almost 2months late for my cycle and a am increasingly hungry all the time , sleepy all day and urinating considerably a lot more then before . a took one test and it came back negative a am doing another in the morning to make sure but if a am not pregnant then that could be causing these symptoms ?",1,105473,"hi, thanks for the query. since you have used birth control pills irregularly and also used plan b, it is difficult to predict when you will have a period. even with this, in most cases, for women using birth control pills, periods will come only after the active pills are over despite using plan b in the middle of the cycle. plan b works in more than 90% cases if taken properly. concomitant use of both does not decrease the efficacy of plan b, and it still works. it works by delaying ovulation and changing the lining of the uterus to prevent pregnancy from occurring. it does not work if pregnancy has already occurred. the best way to know if you are pregnant in this case would be to take a pregnancy test at least 3-3 1/2 week after using plan b using a morning urine sample. if it is negative, chances of pregnancy resulting from the sexual act on that day [before you took plan b] are negligible. another way to know is wait for your period while taking the sugar pills, if it is delayed a pregnancy test 7 days after the missed period will help. hope you find this useful. thanks for using chat doctor, and have a good day. chatdoctor bagdeconsultant obstetrician and gynecologist"

good day a would like to find out something .... a used to be on demo proverb .. a first went on it january of this year and a came off on october of this year ... a had my period on october 24th and it ended on the 30th of october ... a had unprotected sex on november 2nd and took posting 2 on the 4th of november ... would a be pregnant ? ?,2,106922,"hallow dear, your menstrual cycle though not very regular, is varying between 26 and 29 days; i should say fairly regular. in regular menstrual cycle, the egg is released 14 days prior to the next expected menses. the egg has a life of 24 hours while sperms are active for 72 hours. hence, a period of about a week around the day of egg release is fertile period. considering your period of about 28 days, your expected period was around 14 november and the day of egg release (ovulation) would be around 31 october. this calculates fertile period from 27 october to 4 november. thus, your unprotected intercourse on 10 november falls way outside the fertile period. thus, according to this calculation, you carry very minimal risk of pregnancy due to this intercourse. however, we have to consider your age factor. your age is 47 years; nearing menopause. variation in your menstrual pattern is due to the premenopausal changes. during this period of life, the ovulation is very unpredictable and irregular. not all the cycles are ovulatory. moreover, the menses also may become irregular. thus, it really becomes difficult to calculate the safe period. even if your menses are delayed, you cannot figure out whether these are premenopausal irregularities or possibility of pregnancy. hence, during this phase of life, it is always advisable to use reliable contraceptive like condom. i feel, with this menstrual history and history of intercourse, you stand very minimal, almost no chance of pregnancy. you should get your menses. however, if at all you do not get menses even 40 days after the last menstrual period; i.e. 26 november, perform pregnancy test on overnight first morning urine sample. i hope this helps you."

"hello , a just got married 2 months back and took a birth control pill ( pill ) for the first time . by periods were fine for the first month , however a having more than 10 days bleeding for my second period . by gynaec is out of town so can not consult . is it of ? ? now long will it continue ?",1,27194,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. tri-sprintec is a birth control pill that has a traffic regimen; which means that each color pill in the package has a slightly different dose of hormones. occasionally, women who take traffic pills may have some spotting in the first few days after each pill strength changes over the course of the month. this may cause some slight bleeding or spotting when were not supposed to have your period. whenever you had vaginal bleeding, regardless of the cause, usually there is some cramping that accompanies it. furthermore, it is not unusual to have irregular bleeding or spotting in the first 3 months of pill use. both sprinter and tri-sprintec are considered low-dose birth control pills, however there are many brands on the market that have a lower dose of estrogen than the pill you are currently taking. so you may have less irregular bleeding and spotting on a different kind of monophasic (same dose all month) birth control pill. regarding pregnancy, the chance of your conceiving while taking birth control pills and using a condom is basically nonexistent. so i believe the symptoms you were experiencing are side effects due to the new birth control pill. if your desire is for lighter, regular periods, a different brand of monophasic pill may work better for you with fewer side effects. i hope i was able to adequately answer questions today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

recently a have had problems after walking short distance with hip and shin pain this affects right hip and shin and sometimes a wake up with pain in hip and shin . a am used to exercise and have always done plenty of walking . would this be the beginning of an arthritic condition . a am 58 years old .,1,96035,"the shin-bone lies directly under the skin. there is no muscle between the shin-bone and the skin. any injury over the shin causes direct injury to shin-bone. sometimes it causes blood collection under the periosteum (thin covering over bone) of shin-bone. it causes sever pain and indentation for 1-2 weeks. the superficial perineal nerve lies on lateral part of leg near the shin-bone and give sensory supplies to some part of leg and upper part of foot. if it gets injured, causes numbness on upper part of foot and some part of leg. rest, icing, local application of non-irritant analgesic gel and anti-inflammatory analgesics such as ibuprofen will decrease pain and swelling. nerve enhancer such as pregabalin will be helpful in decreasing numbness. hope this helps. hope this answers your question. if you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. i will be happy to answer your questions."

a have been taking try sprinter for about 9 months . this is the first month that i have been sexually active on it . pm supposed to start my period in six days . this morning after i had sex with my boyfriend i noticed that there was a time about of brown discharge . a always take the pills on time and have only taken one late during the first week of this pack . be also always pulls out . what is the likelihood that in pregnant,1,33341,"hi, if you came to my clinic with those complaints i would ask you to stop worrying. many women that start using the pills for the first time experience similar problems. i understand that you have taken the inactive pills first and then started on the active pills. also, you have had intercourse only after your period was over that is about 11 days ago. the chances of pregnancy occurring after a single act of unprotected sexual intercourse are only 4%. also, for women that have regular periods the chance of getting pregnant is more if intercourse occurs after 11-12 days since the first day of the period. hence, the chances of getting pregnant are low if you have had contact before this period. you are also having a sick feeling in the stomach and most probably a cramp like feeling. this may be due to the pills as some females take time to get adjusted and may improve with continuous use and by taking the pills with food. the pills are not known to cause any major effect on the baby if they are inadvertently taken in early pregnancy. since you have started taking the active pills late, i would recommend that you use a backup contraceptive measure like condoms, for the next 7 days while you still take the pills to avoid pregnancy. i would be pleased to answer any further queries that you may have, enjoy a wonderful day."

a have had well a palsy twice now and a am only twenty years old . .. should i be concerned . her doctor mention something about shingles but she has never had a rash or anything that i looked up even look like the shingles never mind this is not free,1,14849,"shingles isn't contagious unless you haven't had chickenpox. what happens is you get chickenpox, usually as a child, then the virus goes dormant in the body. years later it can break out in a localized rash as shingles. so shingles itself can't be transmitted. however, since it is the same virus that causes chickenpox, if someone has not had chickenpox or been immunized for it, they can get it from the shingles patient who has the rash. so unless someone is susceptible that way, there is no reason to have her stay home, especially since she has no rash and the doctor isn't even sure yet. if she does get a rash, she can keep it covered while she is working with a bandage, and then with her shirt over that. things should be okay that way. frequent handwashing is important for her and everyone else as well. hope this helps."
a have had well a palsy twice now and a am only twenty years old . .. should i be concerned . her doctor mention something about shingles but she has never had a rash or anything that i looked up even look like the shingles never mind this is not free,2,103576,"dear tina ma'am, hi & welcome to chat doctor. yes shingles can be transmitted from a person with active shingles to another person who has never had chickenpox. shingles, also known as herpes zoster, is an infection of a nerve and the surrounding skin. it is caused by the varicella-zoster virus which also causes chickenpox. the main symptom is a painful rash which develops on one side of the face or body. the rash forms blister that contain the active virus. the blisters typically scab over in 7-10 days & clear up within 2-4 weeks. the person with active shingles can transmit the virus until the rash has developed crusts (scab). the virus that causes shingles can spread from a person with active shingles to another person who has never had chickenpox. once infected, the person will develop chickenpox, however but not shingles. so, i would advise your daughter to avoid contact with her friend till the rash has developed crusts. i also recommend shingles vaccine for both of you as it reduces the risk of developing shingles and the long-term pain from post-herpetic neuralgia (phn) caused shingles. hope the suggestion given would be beneficial to both of you."

"i there doc , sounds silly but my granddaughter bit me on my neck , didst puncture any skin , but we can see where my vein runs and she bit in the middle of it , and now two good sized lumps have formed , plus another one is forming above the two still going up the vein . is there anything to worry about the pain is very intense and movement starts of like shocks up into my neck and skull and gets too intense to talk . please advise .",1,89464,"hi, thank you for providing the brief history of you. as you have swollen eyes and also neck pain post headstand these are common signs and symptoms which arise. you need to avoid for a day or two such position and then see if the pain is reduced if it doesn't than a neurological examination is advised. as post headstand, there is a physiological process of excess fluid rushing to head and lead to swelling of the eyes and it's a common effect which stays for a while and reduces as time passes by.also, the neck pain can be due to compression of the body weight on the forehead leading to neck muscle spasms. as mentioned if the pain subsides in day or two its just activity induced but if the pain progresses than a neurological examination is advised. in my clinical practice we advise to wait for a day or two and if the symptoms aggregates than a neurological examination is performed. regards jay in chat doctor."
