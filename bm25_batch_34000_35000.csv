"right around my thigh area and down my leg it feels like a scrub board . a have been told by my doctor that a have bad tendons . a roll on a exercise roller and that helps some relief from the pain . however , they never completely go away . when a sit on cushion that is soft they come back bigger and start hurting again . a have had this a long time .",1,31101,"hi, usually patients with sedation on board tend to wake up anywhere from few hours to 72 hours after taking the sedation off. however, in the elderly this can be more delayed. further, the anti-seizure medications that were given also cause sedation and could be delaying her waking up. however, all this depends on where exactly she has bled and whether there is and bruising of the brain itself. with the initial ct scan what the doctors meant when they said the bleeding was not as bad as they though must have been that they expected a bigger clot that would have needed surgery. however, how much injury the brain itself would have sustained, only time will tell, and follow-up scans can throw some light on it. hope this helps."

"what can it be the reason for the chest pain , tenderness under my left breast and rib cage , feeling like fire burning and tiredness up my left shoulder waking up and feeling much tired around the neck , fire burns on both legs around the upper the kneels , indigestion , frequently pee , pain and pressure inside lungs , too much thirsty feeling when foods and drinks pass through oesophagus after swallowed , anxiety and discomfort , burning within the gall bladder and stress .",3,41649,"hello. thank you for your question and welcome to chat doctor. i understand your concern. well, i am going to try and explain the differences between various origins of the pain which can arise from the rib cage. there is angina. it is described more like mid-chest heaviness or squeezing sensation, that is triggered by exercise and relieved by rest, which radiates to the both sides of the chest, to the jaw and left arm and shoulder. it is indicative of a blockage within one or more coronary arteries and reflects the lowering of blood supply to the heart muscle. an ekg obtained in the moment of chest pain, if it fills this description, would be helpful. then there is pleuritic chest pain. this kind of pain is sharp, stabbing pain that can happen in any part of the chest area. no radiation like in anginal pain. it arises from acute or chronic inflammation of the linings that are within the rib cage: pleura (lining of the lungs) or pericardium (lining of the heart) or both. in this regard, i would recommend a chest x-ray for pleural inflammation or effusion. in case of pericardial pain and anginal pain, echocardiogram is helpful, by evaluating the size, motility and function of heart muscle and valves, and also by assessing the pericardium and whether there is fluid build-up within it, or not. other causes of chest pain are related to the locomotion system of the rib cage: muscle soreness, bone and cartilage-related pain. in the end, stress can also cause chest pain. i hope i was helpful with my answer. best regards,"

"hello first we are living in belgium . by wife is 7 weeks pregnant and is cramping , passing blood and clots . be went to the of earlier and they could not find a heart beat . they said come back in three days.my wife says the cramps are getting worse and still passing blood . to we need to go back to the of ?",1,24065,"hello thanks for posting at chat doctor. atrial fibrillation means irregular contractions of the heart. due to irregular contractions of the heart, clots tend to form in the heart which may later go towards the brain and other organs leading to stroke. hence, such patients are kept on blood thinners which prevent the clots from forming. these clots when they migrate to the brain can cause falls. also since the heart rate is irregular, the heart may not receive blood supply for short intervals which can also lead to falls. as you said he has stopped hid blood thinner medications, this may be due to formation of clots. cramping in the legs is less likely due to clots or blood thinners, but some heart patients are on diuretic medications like lasix which can cause electrolyte imbalance and result in cramps. kidney problems can also lead to electrolyte imbalance and cramps. calcium deficiency, it d deficiency are also important causes of cramps. please do an ecg, serum electrolyte levels, serum calcium, it d add 2 d echo. brain imaging (mri + mra) and carotid (neck artery) doppler should also be done to rule out narrowing of the vessels of the neck and the head which may cause falls. wishing you good healthregards"

"a have sciatica . a had lumbar surgery 40+ years ago with disc removal . now at times the sciatic pain is often quite intent and at times a have to urinate right away to relieve the pain and also sit down for a short period of time . a take taranto for dvt and slavic , an operation is not recommended . your opinion please .",1,21573,"hello. i have been through your question and understand your concern. lumbar disc surgery is sometimes associated with recurrence of disc herniation at the same level. this is because it is impossible to take out all the intervertebral disc. if you have back pain and sciatica, then you need to have a lumbar mri, which i presume you did. if there is a herniated disc that explains your sciatica, even in the level of your previous surgery, then you should consider a second surgery. but there should be a clear radiologic and clinical correlation. pregnancy with its weigh gain and increase in the normal anterior bending of the lumbar spine can worsen the back problem. so i recommend a neurological or neurosurgical consult to evaluate the radiologic finding and your symptoms to see if there is any indication for a second surgery. hope this helps with your question, please feel free for further questions."

"by lft has shown big levels ave just returned from the of where a picked up , an upper respiratory infection . a have priced up a virus which has left me quite ill , is severe sour nauseous in the stomach part of liver disease , if so how can it be treated ?",1,5256,"hi, how are you? my name is chat doctor. thanks for writing to chat doctor and i hope to answer your question today. hepatitis c virus, as i am sure you are aware, damages the liver cells. the liver has an enormous capacity to regenerate, meaning if part of the liver is damaged, then new liver cells are formed to replace the damaged liver (unlike skin where damaged skin is replaced by scar). the problem with hepatitis c is, it is present constantly in the blood and liver and continues to damage the liver continuously. just like a rubber band can be stretched only so far before it snaps, so is the regenerative capacity of the liver. depending on how virulent the hepatitis c strain is, over the course of 10-30 yrs, the liver exhausts its capacity to regenerate and just like skin, the damaged liver cells starts getting replaced by scar tissue - this leads to hardening of the normal supple liver - a condition known as liver fibrosis which later on leads to liver cirrhosis. the problem with this is, under normal circumstances anywhere between 1200 and 1500 ml of blood flows through the liver per min. when the liver is normal and supple, this blood can flow easily through the liver. but when the liver begins to stiffen or harden as in the case of cirrhosis, this blood is met with great resistance during its flow through the liver. this is called as ""portal hypertension"". so the blood starts to look for alternate routes to return to the heart and the most accessible route for it is through the veins of the food pipe (esophagus and stomach). the problem with this is, the veins in the esophagus and stomach are very thin walled and are not used to carrying this much volume of blood. so they distend to a great degree (a condition called as varices) and sometime even rupture with catastrophic consequences. this is easily diagnosed by upper gi endoscopy where the largely dilated veins can be seen. but in your case, since multiple upper gi endoscopies have not demonstrated any varices, it means your liver has not reached a state of ""portal hypertension"" yet and the disease seems not be progressing or is ""stable"". if i was your doctor, i would also get a ""fibrosis"" which is a special scan of the liver to look at the amount of stiffness or hardening of the liver. this can be repeated regularly to see the progression of the fibrosis. i would also explore the different treatments for hepatitis c infection. the gold standard is of course a liver biopsy which will demonstrate the exact status of your liver. i hope this helped, and i do hope you will get better soon. please write back to me if you need any further clarifications especially the treatment options available to treat hepatitis c. have a great day"

a recently noticed this weird feeling in the middle of my chest after long walks or when going up stairs . maybe pm experiencing heart flutters . by blood pressure is perfect although and for the most part pretty good shape for a 40 or old male . would this be caused by stress or something else ?,1,103659,"hello. thank you for your question and welcome to chat doctor. i carefully read your concern. you are a 55-year-old woman, which is a borderline age for risk for cardiovascular disease. the pain in the chest you described, which is triggered by effort and goes away when you stop, fulfills some criteria of angina (chest pain caused by narrowing of coronary arteries - the arteries that surround the heart like a crown, hence the name, and supply its muscle with oxygen and nutrients). of course, in this level of conversation, when none of the test were carried out, this is just an assumption judging by the characteristics of the pain. therefore, i would strongly recommend you to do a cardiac check-up: ekg, echocardiogram and cardiac stress test. also, i would recommend you to be put on a 24-hour blood pressure monitor, to determine if there is also high blood pressure (hypertension) or not. as for the rapid heart rate, if it goes up while exerting, and remains regular, then my opinion is that there is nothing to worry about. there is a simple formula for this - the heart rate accepted as normal, at a person that is exercising, is 220-age (165 beats per minute, in your case). my further recommendations would be, that you should do a complete blood count and measure the levels of the following cell derivatives: - glucose - hba1c - urea and creatinine - ast, alt, get - electrolytes - total cholesterol, ldl- and hdl-fraction, triglycerides i hope i wash helpful and thorough, with my answer. feel free to contact me again. take care."

(that is because palpitations are a sign of anxiety, and you are anxious about the anxiety itself). you end-up in an endless loop of increasing anxiety and palpitations. so next time you get palpitations, just tell yourself, ""this is a normal reaction"" and observe the heart beat closely - you will find that it immediately slows down."

i . a have very rotten molar and wisdom teeth on top and bottom on both sides . problem is the right side of my head just above my temple is swollen and throbbing with severe pain . is this normal and will it eventually go away . a take a mix of neuron plus and protein extra also metronome and cram duo forte antibiotics . its been over 2 weeks now and it doesn't seem to stop much . a mainly need to know will the pain and swelling go away or is it a sign of something worse . please remember i can not ford to see a dentist . thankyou,1,57293,"hi. welcome to chat doctor. as per your complaint it seems that you have inflammation of the gum flap surrounding the wisdom tooth and the condition is known as peritonitis. pericoronitis occurs if food gets lodged between wisdom tooth and the gum flap covering the wisdom tooth... and by food it does not mean that you see big food particles stuffed in there, but it also means uncleaned area and bacterial growth below gum flap... it leads to inflammation of the flap leading to pain swelling and as the area lies close to the throat there can be sore throat and swollen lymph nodes. but pain in the tooth in front of the wisdom tooth can be infection or decay in second molar tooth. the line of treatment is antibiotics, painkillers, mouthwash but only this is not enough to you, you should go to dentist again and ask him to irrigate the area between gum flap and wisdom tooth with saline, betadine solution and hy chat doctor. . other thing is done warm saline gargles, it will help you to reduce inflammation... carry on with the course of your antibiotics and painkillers, your pain and swelling must go in two three days. once you get relieved of your discomfort visit the dentist again and get an iop ar (x-ray) done to find out whether wisdom tooth will erupt to proper occlusion or is impacted (means having an obstruction and won't erupt to occlusion). if it is not impacted just get your gum flap removed known as operculectomy and if impacted get your tooth extracted... this will be your ultimate treatment and finish your problem forever. if the second molar tooth is also decayed leading to pain you can get root canal treatment done to save the tooth and resolve infection. hope you recover soon. thanks and regards."

"in 37 or 165 lbs male i have a small lump on my lower back on the left hip side . it is not paining much , but once in a while a feel small pinch . this small lump was there for almost 3 years . a remember a was playing tennis in hot sun in arizona one day and was dehydrated and got this lump the next day and it stayed there . as this lump due to the muscle spasm or anything else is a am worried of . please let me know . thank you very much .",1,82366,"hello friend, thank you for posting your query through chat doctor. i am a homeopath answering your query and the answer which i am going to give you may contain several thoughts which may appear strange or new for you. this i say because homeopathy is a new system of medicine and is almost unheard by the majority of the population. therefore, due to the high influence of the conventional medicine the people at large are brainwashed to believe and act according to the health education given by them. coming back to the fibroadenoma of your left breast in the year 1979, you had a psychological conflict in the mind level. you are a sensitive individual and that is why your left breast was affected. it must have been related with your child chat doctor. the sensitivity is genetic, and you reacted to the conflict through the brain according to a genetic programming. mind-brain - organ affection resulted in the development of a lump in your left breast in 1979. you consulted your gynecologist, and he suggested that it may turn to become cancerous in future and so it is better to remove it, and you subdued to his suggestion. actually the lump in the breast was an attempt of the body to cure you, or it was the result of a self defense mechanism. since you had not resolved the conflict in the psychological level, the lump remained there without getting resolved. but the body kept the lump protected in a cyst with minimum amount of inflammation called chronic cystitis. by removing the fibroadenoma or chronic cystic mastitis, you were not cured, but your lump in the breast was removed. in 1995 also you are the same person, you are the same sensitive person, and you underwent another more serious psychological conflict and the same left breast was again affected in a more serious manner. instead of recognizing the mass as a defense mechanism, you got the fear in you that you have cancer. the tissue changes also suggested that there is more serious pathology, and they labelled your lump this time as cancer and suggested removal of your left breast. if you could have recognized the lump as a defense mechanism and if you had no fear of cancer, you could have retained your breast. but the fear of cancer is such that it is associated with death and so you lost your breast. in no case, either by removal of lump in 1979 or by removal of your breast in 1995, you are not cured only your disease is cured. hope by this time you have got the answer for your query. both are related to each other because they are in the same individual, same sensitivity, same program. homeopathy cures the person and once the individual is cured all his diseases will be cured. with best wishes,"

"to ... my fiancee and a had sex . the had just started taking birth control on the fifth day of her period a week before . to technically by the time we had sex she has taken try spine 8 times . even with me ejaculating inside of her , is it likely she a pregnant ?",3,41925,"hallow dear, from your history, i understand that you had not inserted your penis inside the vagina, nor did you ejaculate on he vaginal opening. however, pre-ejaculation secretions come out unknowingly and contain some sperms which are capable of fertilizing an ovum. though she has taken unwanted 72, post-coital emergency contraceptive pills, she has consumed them rather late - after 6 days. these pills are very effective emergency contraceptive pills if taken within 72 hours of the unprotected sex. now the key factor is when did you have this venture of unprotected sex! the egg is released (ovulation)14 days prior to the next expected menses. the egg has life of 24 hours while the sperms are active for 72 hours. therefore, a period of about one week around the day of ovulation is fertile period. if you had your sex during fertile period, the chance of pregnancy would be high. so do your calculation of the days to find out the risk of pregnancy. now you have to wait expectantly for her menses to appear. one hitch in this also is that after unwanted 72 pills, there is a possibility of delaying period by about a week or so. so the best option for you is if at all she misses her period, about 3 weeks after this incidence of sex, get her pregnancy test done on the overnight first morning urine sample; done earlier, these test may give false negative results. alternatively, you may opt for beta chat doctor test which gives reliable results even few days before missing a period. if she is pregnant, you have an option of medical termination of pregnancy till 9 weeks of gestation. to avoid such stressful situations in the future, please practice reliable contraceptive methods like birth control pills, condom or intrauterine device. i hope this helps you."

i a had taken in mention every nine days from 7th day of my cycle and or said me your egg only two so we are not going for if but my period is not coming till date 14th and my last lamp date is 16th kept but always my period came before 4 days of last lamp can a a pregnant,1,72620,"hallow dear, the duration of pregnancy when counted from the last menstrual period is 280 days or 9 calendar months and 7 days. in fact the egg is released (ovulation) 14 days prior to the next expected menses; i.e. if the cycle is of 30 days the egg will be released on day 16 of the cycle. the egg has 24 hours life while the sperms are active for 72 hours. hence, the conception can happen about a week around the day of ovulation. considering this, for practical purpose we consider 2 weeks less from the day of ovulation (or conception). so the pregnancy precisely is of 266 days. however, for the sake of convenience, we calculate it as 280 days from the last menstrual period date. considering these facts, if the delivery date is to be expected on september 30, the last menstrual period date should be 23 december. (would you be having it then?) now your cycle is of 30 days period. so the expected date of ovulation should be 07 january. hence, if the conception takes place on 07 january, the due date of delivery would be 30 september. the hitch here is that you should have ovulation taking lace on 07 january. moreover, we have noticed that all the pregnancies do not last for 280 days. the delivery can take place any time between 3 weeks earlier to 1 week later than the expected due date of delivery. keeping these facts and calculations in mind, you may plan your sexual relations accordingly. i hope this will help you."

a had a sharp pain near to heart ! ! it was paining about 12 hours after that it was quite well ! ! again by night it was paining during moving my body or taking breathe hardly ! ! about 3 days slowly its gone ! ! and sometimes i am feeling like some what paining ! ! what is it ?,1,75965,just because of normal walking in round wooden table it can not start paining in knee joint. here you need to clear one thing whether you was walking on your knee or was walking normally on your feet. if it was walking on your knee then it can start paining you due to strain on soft tissue as well as knee joint. i suggest use cold pack and apply some pain relieving ointment for time being for one or two days. later or in between if you are comfortable and feels good start using hot pack for heat fomentation at painful soft tissue. most important thing if it's paining then do not do much of walking and folding knee activities. take some rest. it should be all right on its own with bodies natural healing capacity. but if it is not becoming well then you need to visit orthopedic doctor as well physiotherapist for proper examination and treatment. you may need to take one x-ray of knee joint as well to check no further damage at knee level. i suggest go ahead with proper treatment with orthopedic doctor as per evaluation and if needed to take physiotherapy treatment too. physiotherapy treatment will also help you to reduce soft tissue strain by increasing healing in soft tissue as well it will also help for pain relief. i am sure this will be useful if you follow the advice properly. take care.

by nine year old granddaughter on occasion and seems to be getting more frequent will get shaky in her hands . blood sugar is good when a checked it . the is not diabetic but thought a would check . the is also a little more emotional than usual . that would cause this ?,1,54619,"hi there, im sorry your granddaughter is having some health issues. let me explain each item in the report with the information you've provided me. phagocytosis are abnormal types of blood cells that are round instead of the usual disc shape. this can be quite common in patients with sickle cell anemia, as the body pushes out immature red blood cells due to the shortage of normal functioning blood cells. the spleen digests red blood cells that are normal, and in cases of sickle cell or other hematologic disease, can become enlarged due to the fact that it is working harder. if your granddaughter is very anemic or having low platelets, sometimes a splenectomy (removal of the spleen is warranted). if she's not having any difficulty with anemia or bleeding, then leaving the spleen in is an option. when red blood cells get broken down at an increased rate, this can cause gallstones to form in the gallbladder, which can also cause liver enzymes to be elevated. i don't believe that her kidney infection or type 1 diabetes are related to her sickle cell anemia, but if she's having recurrent abdominal pain (sickle cell crisis) and gallstones, it may not be a bad idea to consider having her gallbladder and spleen removed at the same time. finally, a small uterus is nothing to be concerned about in a 9-year-old. this sounds like an incidental finding. i hope i have answered your questions. please feel free to contact me should you have any further questions."

"i have already been diagnosed with a kidney infection and although my wee smelt like blood and the urine result said there was blood in my urine , i have noticed that the last bit of my urine is enface blood , so i can now see the blood , should i seek medical advice asap or wait till monday ?",1,30687,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the number of white and red blood cells in your urine has nothing to do with an std or pregnancy. urinary tract infections typically cause bacteria, a substance called leukocyte esterase, and nitrites to be present in your urine. red blood cells can also appear if the inside of your bladder is inflamed from the infection. however, the presence of red blood in your urine can also be caused by other conditions of the kidneys or bladder that cause bleeding without infection. the most common of these is a kidney stone, and if you have had very severe pain in your back or lower pelvis, especially on one side, that diagnosis is also possible. pregnancy or stds do not generally cause blood to be seen in the urine. if you are concerned about pregnancy or std exposure, these can be tested separately, but you do not have to be concerned about these conditions because of the presence of blood cells in your urine. i hope i was able to answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

hi i am 28+6 weeks pregnant and for the last 2 days overtime i go for a poo it is really painful and i bleed quite bit of fresh blood from my bum after i am really worried that something might be wrong with my baby is all this normal as it leaves me saw for the day afterwards,1,72167,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. estimating your date of conception is only really possible for women who have a 28-day menstrual cycle. by convention, the computer programs that are used to calculate your due date are working from an assumption that a woman has a 28-day cycle, and that conception took place exactly 2 weeks after your last period. if your cycle is longer or shorter, your ovulation could have taken place on a different day than what is estimated. so really just depends on whether you were with your second partner during your fertile window, which really can start 7 to 10 days after the first day of your last menstrual period and continue until a week before your next menstrual period is due. so depending upon how close and timing your sexual encounter with your second partner was, will determine how likely it is for him to be the father. if the margin either way is only a matter of a few days, you really will need a dna test to accurately predict the paternity of your child. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

i by father is having continuous cough for a while . the blood test result shows high eur ( 160 ) and low haemoglobin ( 6.8 ) . best of the things are normal.he had this cough for more than six months and we have been consulting doctors . is there a reason why esr is high and haemoglobin is so low . be is 60yr old,1,13265,"hi, i agree your fasting glucose levels are very high. there can be 2 reasons why the morning glucose level is high. one possibility is that your night dose is not adequate (we call it dawn effect). the remedy for this is that we increase the night dose of insulin. the other possibility is that your night insulin dose is very high than needed and because of that your sugar levels become very low in the midnight when you sleep and your body tries to compensate for this low sugar by breaking down complex stored sugars from your liver into blood. (we call this osmosis phenomenon). for this effect, we need to check the blood sugar at midnight around 2am or so. if this midnight glucose level is very low, then we have to decrease your night insulin levels. therefore, the best for you is to go immediately to your treating doctor and adjust the insulin dose you are taking. regards"

"hello , a have a preemie baby ( born around 34 weeks ) and is now 8 months old . a have started giving her solids since she turned 6 months but she has never been a fan of solid food . around 7 months she got the flu and refused all solids which was normal a was told . once she was fine again , a have started giving her solids but the amount is very small as she refuses . recently though , overtime a feed her ( 4 to 5 spoonfuls ) , she would vomit after a few hours . it can be fruit , vegetables , chicken ... but she would act all cranky and then throw up the milk she drank . when a stop the solids , the vomiting stops . is soon as a restart , it starts again . that can it be ?",1,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"a few days ago a began feeling pain in my groin region , then last night the pain increased dramatically and a felt a solid lump . a then decided to go to sleep through the pain and awoke this morning due to the pain being too plenty . a thought it may have been some sort of cyst , therefore a soaked myself in a bath with salts to try to burst it . once a removed myself from the baths , the pain increased again , however , about 20 minutes later , a sat down to self examine and as a sat down , it burst . the discharge was a dark bloody colour at first , with a yellowish puss . when as more flowed out , the colour went to a lighter red , similar to that of a light bleed . a was just wondering what to do next .",1,95176,"hi, thanks for writing in. a 4 mm lesion in the breast is too small to characterize. the needle fnac was offered probably to be more accurate in making a diagnosis. if the lump of cells in the 4 mm area was properly targeted then appearance of liquid confirms the presence of a cyst with fluid. even in the aspirated fluid, there would have been cells and i guess that slides were prepared and seen under a microscope in your case. if it was indeterminate then it means that no cancer cells were confirmed in the area. technically speaking even if the 4 mm area was burst with the needle then the cells were confined to a closed area and will not spill over to any other area. also, it might have been close to the skin surface. please be informed that breast cancer does not have a tendency to spread by a needle track. therefore, you are completely safe from this procedure. keeping in mind the indeterminate nature of the fluid from the cyst it is advisable to go for regular clinical examinations and also do self breast exam once every 15 days and consult your doctor should you have any doubts regarding any new breast lumps. please do not worry."

a have pain that runs from my hip to my foot in my left leg only a have no insurance since being laid an 30 and a am told this could that thousands of dollars to diag . if at all . some save nerve . damage others say art . of course none are doctors cause me not to sleep at night and a limp help a take no medication and am not a fan as a see my com and had have to do that every day . it scares me today is really bad a you and says free which is not so you can wait for the next person who has the money to ask a question,1,36331,hi suzanne. my name is vinay. i am sorry to here about your disc degeneration. there are many types of surgeries that can be done to help control the pain that you are suffering from but none of them can be attempted before you get that mri. the surgeon needs to know what kind of nerve compression is causing the pain and the stiffness and needs to be able to plan out the surgery using the pictures that are given with the mri. now when it comes to insurance. i am no expert on health insurance and i wish i had some easy quick fix place that you could go to. my best advice is to check in with your local public clinic (which i'm betting you have already done). the only other thing i could possibly suggest is that you look to getting treated in another country. there are companies that can arrange for travel and surgery to other countries to get treatment at a fraction of the cost of the same treatment in the united states. the whole concept is called medical tourism. you could look into it if you want. see if that works out better for you. i hope this helps. thanks for coming to chat doctor .com

my b12 was low at 245 and i have infertility issues because of it including a miscarriage at 6 weeks in 2009 it is not diet related i got put on cycobalmin tablets which didst increase it so my doctor doubled them it only raised my b12 to 330 i was told to stop my tablets and see if my body could keep it up but it has fell back down to 240 so was wondering if the injections would be a better choice than the tablets i am 28 female 4 foot 10 and 8 stone 5,1,96183,"i'm female 22 yrs and i also have really dark circles under my eyes. i tried all the creams and gels at pharmacies and none of them worked. i was diagnosed with vitamin b12 deficiency which causes dark under eye circles. it took me years to get a diagnosis because physicians don't generally test b12 levels especially if your cbc counts are normal. i had lots of routine blood work done, and they all came back normal. a few months ago i was experiencing severe tingling (i had other symptoms too, but the tingling was most bothersome) so i told my new doctor to test me for absolutely everything that can cause it. my b12 level came back at 30 which is extremely low. the funny thing about it was that i took b12 vitamins all the time... so my body just wasn't absorbing them. you should also consider getting tested for celiac disease - if you have symptoms associated with it - because it deprives your body of important vitamins. i'm sure there are products or something out there that helps dark circles, but it won't help if you have an underlying condition."

my 6 month old daughter has just developed a rash-maybe eczema-in the last week and she has just started having some formula and pureed fruit and vegetables causing her to not have a bowel movement for nearly 5 days . she is back to going regularly again now but i just wondered if the lack of bowel movement could cause the spots/rash or if she is likely to be allergic to formula or some food ?,1,34589,"dear friend, what you are asking is if the lack of stooling for 4-5 days could have caused the rash. the simple answer is no. whether she might be allergic to some food or formula ingredient - i cannot say yes or no with confidence. you can try eliminating one food after another and see if the rash goes away. the only other way is a hi-tech method to check the blood for antibodies of the ige class to different foods. i would not recommend this at present, but if the problem does not go away for, say, 2-3 months, you can approach her pediatrician for advice on allergy testing. first, though, you need to confirm that this is an allergic rash, because it might well be just a viral rash!"

"hello , about a month and a half ago , a drank norlevo the morning after pill , and it worked beautifully . month latter a got my period on time , and it finished a week ago . today a got my period again . is this because of the pill and what needs to be done ? thankyou !",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"
"hello , about a month and a half ago , a drank norlevo the morning after pill , and it worked beautifully . month latter a got my period on time , and it finished a week ago . today a got my period again . is this because of the pill and what needs to be done ? thankyou !",2,2046,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. typically, women are advised to start birth control pills within seven days of their last menstrual period because it is unlikely that she would've already ovulated at that time. if you start the pill later in your cycle, the process initiates ovulation may have already begun and your body may produce an egg that is capable of being fertilized that cycle. however, even if you ovulated right when you started to take the pill, it is unlikely that the egg would still be viable to be fertilized after seven days. therefore, waiting seven days before having unprotected intercourse most likely was enough time to ensure that you would not become pregnant. modern pregnancy tests will become positive within 10 days to two weeks after conception, so if you do not have a menstrual period at the end of your pill pack, you should perform a urine pregnancy test to be safe. however, if you start your pill later than one week after the start of your period, you may not actually bleed the first month during the pill free week. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was reassuring. best wishes,"

"i doctor , i am having erectile dysfunction i believe .. or premature ejaculation as i am unable to hold it of for a minute while doing masturbation .. also erection is also not so strong .. my penis size is just 5inches when it get erected and by normal 2 inches .. i am a single .. can i marry and lead a happy sexual life",1,43763,hellothanks for query. you have misconception about premature ejaculation. premature ejaculation is an ejaculation that happens when one ejaculates within one minute after penetration of vagina while is engaged in intro vaginal sexual intercourse with female partner and is not applicable to while masturbating. what you get is an early ejaculation due to excessive penile stimulation by shaking your penis during masturbation. the size of the penis in flaccid state has no significance at all. it is hardness of the penis on erection that is important for sexual satisfaction of both the partners. as such there is no medicine that can increase penile length and size. the night emission is natural and normal at the age of adolescence and gets resolved without any treatment over a period of time. chat doctor.

i a have recently started to get chest pains and went to my doctors about it and they have put it down to scar tissue from where i had open heart surgery when i was 4 . a just wondered if this is caused by scar tissue or if there is something else wrong ?,1,64955,"hi, as you have mentioned that you had injured your penis during childhood and a surgical procedure was done, it is possible that there is a scar formation in the region. the penis head and fore skin is a very sensitive structure. after putting the stitches, it has developed into scar tissue. this scar tissue is preventing the foreskin to roll down. the pain and discomfort is do to the scar tissue formation. for a small scar tissue, you can try manipulating it by using a lot of lubrication jelly during sex and masturbation and slowly trying to roll down the foreskin. if this does not happen then please do not do it forcibly. using too much force can cause further injury to the foreskin. if it does not roll down with lubricants then please consult the urologist for scar release surgery. this is a minor surgery and works for most patients. if scar tissue is difficult to repair then circumcision can be done depending on the findings after clinical examination."
i a have recently started to get chest pains and went to my doctors about it and they have put it down to scar tissue from where i had open heart surgery when i was 4 . a just wondered if this is caused by scar tissue or if there is something else wrong ?,2,33931,"hi michele jacobi the first thing that has to be done once you find a lump in the region of the chest wall is to confirm what it is. in your case a biopsy has already been done and let us await its result. you're understanding that cancerous lumps don't bleed after biopsy is correct. but i think your presumption that if it was scar tissue it would have bled is not correct. scar tissue also need not bleed. needle biopsies do not usually cause any bleeding unless a blood vessel is ruptured during the procedure since how long have you noticed this lump. is the size of the lump increasing ? if the biopsy comes as positive for cancer then you will have to undergo a series of investigation to find out he the extent of the disease. ? whether it is confined to the chest wall only or whether it has gone beyond the chest wall to other regions. treatment decision will depend on the results of this if the biopsy comes as negative for cancer then there are 2 options 1- if your physician thinks it is insignificant then you need to follow it up. just keep a check on your lump to see whether it is increasing in size and also get it checked by your physician regularly2- the second option (and my preference) is to do an open biopsy especially if the lump was detected recently and is increasing in size and also if the lump is firm to hard (and not very soft). the reason is needle biopsy can be negative, but this does not always mean there is no cancer especially if the tissue sample taken is not adequate. also time factor is important. you may lose time keeping the lump under follow up to see whether it is increasing in size hope you are satisfied with my reply. anyway don't worry. follow your doctors' advice chat doctor."

a have constant pain in both feet and right calf . sometimes feels like fluid running down inside of leg . to one can tell me what is going on they can to find anything wrong . a chiropractor said it is muscle knots . sometimes pain is so bad can to walk . any advice .,1,21962,"dear simone, there is one rule for doctors here in croatia: when you think too much, stop, and think again, but this time think for the simplest diagnose. if you have pain in abdomen and an umbilical hernia seen on us then the first thing to think about is ""abdominal pain caused by hernia"":). there are many conditions in medicine where pain doesn't need to beau localized near the ""pathology"". sometimes pain can be felt on the opposite side of the affected organ. it is known that one of common symptom of myocardial infarction is pain in the left shoulder. also, infection of the abdominal organs can give many types and localizations of pain. the reason for it is simple: when i see pain, i see nerves, not organs (this is my own phrase:)). nerves conduct pain, and nerves are all around, going from periphery to the brain, so pain can be localized on its pathway, so just let's go back to your problem. doctor should tell you the size of hernia and its content which can be only preperitoneal tissue, momentum or even intestines. this dark triangle...mmm.it can be nothing and everything. i usually don't trust our ultrasonographer because they are strange people... sometimes they don't see what they need to see, or they see what they don't need to see. all i see is that us is operator-dependent diagnostic test... but we shouldn't underestimate this finding. it can be uterine moma, endometriosis, cyst or tumor. and yes, it can cause pain you're describing. so what you need to do: 1. ct scan of pelvic and abdominal region. why? as i said, these us findings are always doubtful, ct is a high sensitive test which will find the exact problem for sure. it will tell you the size and severity of hernia and the morphology of this uterine lesion. it can also find some other problems in its early phase."

in trying to conceive since last 1 year after my first child was automatically aborted as he was not growing ... now sometimes my follicles docent grow to appropriate size & this month its totally missing .i am already 33years & losing my patience . please help,1,76346,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. fertomid is a type of fertility medication used help to cause ovulation in women who have trouble getting pregnant. because you did get pregnant (even though you had a miscarriage), unless you have been trying since then for over a year and been unable to conceive, the fatimid medication will not likely increase your chance of pregnancy significantly. therefore, even if you forgot to take some pills, you still have a significant chance of pregnancy as you are still very young, especially if you have regular menstrual cycles. if you and your husband have not been trying to conceive for more than a year on your own, i would not recommend using any fertility medication. using fatimid for more than four menstrual cycles can actually reduce your risk of pregnancy, as it decreases the effect of estrogen on your uterine lining. 80% of healthy couples will conceive within one year if they are having regular (at least 2 to 3 days per week) intercourse without contraception. one in 10 pregnancies will end in miscarriage, which means that 90% of the time couples will conceive a perfectly healthy pregnancy after a miscarriage without any form of medical treatment. so in summary, missing the fatimid tablets this particular month will not likely affect your chance of conceiving this cycle if you already ovulate naturally. i strongly recommend trying to get pregnant naturally for one year before using any type of fertility medication, as your body has proven that you can conceive even though that pregnancy did not work out. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this additional information was helpful. best wishes,"

i ! by 2 years old son has heavy breathing . or that a how it seems to me . is belly bounces very noticeable when he is sleeping . not all the time but sometimes . but there is no usual heavy breathing noises or moving in the neck or ribs coming visible as in asthma . a be been in doctor couple times for this matter but has not gotten any wiser . a shall take a video and book appointment . that tests i should demand ?,1,831,"hi, thanks for writing in. it appears that your son has a melanoma that might have spread to neck lymph nodes. this is a possibility and has to be confirmed by doing a biopsy. what happens is that lymph nodes are found in many regions of the body and are small unless they are stimulated by disease process. when there is a disease in a person then the lymph nodes of a particular region get enlarged and this is a reaction by the immune mechanism. since your son has been told that he has a melanoma, it has probably involved the neck lymph nodes. the lymph nodes in the neck are close to the carotid artery and internal jugular vein, and it is possible that the lymph nodes have wrapped around these. doing a surgery in this condition is not possible and radiation usually works. it is suggested that you spend some time with your son by going over to his place and know more about the treatment he should be taking for his condition. please do not worry."

"i , a have been trying to conceive for six months now . a am a 28 year old healthy mother of 2 , but i got impatient not getting pregnant as soon as i would like and a was having really bad pms , maybe due to the stress of not getting pregnant so , a started taking a chasteberry and dong quai combo capsule once a day , which are 350mg of chasteberry and 150 my of dong quai . i took it every morning this month up until a week before my period because i started have pregnancy symptoms and i knew i had read somewhere you shouldn't take while pregnant . well , a got my period , but it was not normal . a usually bleed for 5 to six days with medium to heavy flow the whole time , but this month it was super light almost like i was bleeding from a wound and it was trying to stop and clot .... just on again off again spotting for two and a half days then the blood turned to brown/black thick ( yuck ) spotting , which a have never had . a took a pregnancy test at 11 days past ovulation , 13 days past ovulation and then again yesterday when the brown spotting had completely stopped . they were all negative . by breast always stop hurting the day before i get my period , well this month they started hurting more the day a started started spotting and today even more so . a guess my question is can i still be pregnant , was i ever , or did i miscarry because i found online women take dong quai on purpose to miscarry ... which i didst know and i just feel awful now .",1,60687,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. if you have had three negative pregnancy tests, you are not currently pregnant. you do have a history of irregular cycles, so you may just need to wait a bit for your cycle to come. the stress and anxiety about trying to conceive can even delay your cycle. so- try to relax and just keep trying. having intercourse every other day is actually more effective than every day, because it helps to maximize the sperm count in each ejaculate. if you do not menstruate for a while, i recommend doing a pregnancy test every two weeks. if you miss your menses for more than 3 months and are not pregnant, i would see a gun doctor for evaluation.80 percent of couples will conceive within one year. so try to relax and give it some time! i hope i was able to answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"a was bitten 3 days ago by a dog on the inside of my calf it a extremely bruised and a have one deep hole and two slightly open , they keep weeping a can not stand on my heel only tip toe for a short amount of time then the whole bottom of my leg goes numb and starts to ache . that do a do , a haunt cleaned it yet it a so sensitive to touch even the area around it a a about to attempt to do so with some salt water , it just hurts so much . please please help me with a solution or some advise a would be really grateful",1,37527,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. even though your boyfriends penis was inside you for only a short time, sperm can be present in pre-ejaculate (or pre-cum) and if you truly do not want to become pregnant it is really important to avoid any contact of the penis with your vagina during sexual play. the most fertile time of a woman cycle is in the middle, typically 14 days before your menstrual period would be due. so the time from when your period finishes until you start to feel pms symptoms is your fertile time. so in this case, since your boyfriend did not ejaculate, it still would be quite rare for you to have conceived. the most common sign of pregnancy is a late or delayed menstrual period. so in your case, you just need to wait for your period to arrive, and if it is late, you can do an over-the-counter urine pregnancy test which is greater than 99% accurate. pregnancy test do not become positive however until at least 2 to 3 weeks after conception. so in summary, your chances of having gotten pregnant in your particular situation is very, very low. for the future, please make sure that the penis is completely covered with a condom if it has any contact with the opening of your vagina. as long as the area is moist, sperm can swim all the way up your vagina from the opening and result in pregnancy. however, the amount of sperm in pre-cum is extremely low, so again i doubt that you need to be concerned about this one sexual encounter. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was helpful. best wishes,"

"i please can you tell me if this is normal . a have a 7 year old daughter . her heart beat is very strong and you can feel the beat through her clothes when a lay my hand on her chest . it feels like she had such a rapid heart rate , but yet when a have done a home blood pressure rest her heart bear per minute is normal , varies from 85 to 100 per minute on different days . a have taken her to the of and has checked her and said it was all normal.please could you tell me what your thoughts are.many thanks . is pm extremely worried .",1,25338,"hello and thank you for using chat doctor. i carefully read your question and understand your concern. but you should not worry, its nothing serious. as you describe, my opinion is that it might be a rhythm issue. someone can feel strong and fast heart beats for different reasons. it may be a simple sinus tachycardia. this means that the heart is beating faster than 100 beats for minute. its normal range in a resting condition is between 60-100 beats for minute. when it goes up you may feel a strong heart beat in your chest and a sensation like your body is beating too. another reason for this sensation might be what we call an ekstrasystol.these is electrical heart impulses that generates in some parts of heart different from normal sinus rhythm. this generates an escaped beat that the person feels like jumping ore bumping. it gives the sensation like a beat is skipping, may experience palpitations or an anxiety sensation that your daughter explains like trembling. this extrasistoles may happen from different reasons from simple emotional stress to other pathologies like anemia, hyperthyroidism etc. so, my opinion as cardiologist is that you have nothing to worry. it is just a simple episode, and it is quite normal in younger ages. only if these symptoms persist and begins to interfere the daily live, if i was your treating doctor i will recommend some examinations like a blood analysis to exclude anemia, the thyroid hormones, an electrocardiogram, echocardiography and of course a holder monitoring. this will help us to document and see what happens with heart rhythm. at meantime, i will recommend your daughter to avoid coffee, caffeine products because they rise heart frequency and extrasistolic beats. i encourage her to have physical training because sometimes it helps in reducing extrasistoles, tachycardia, even making them disappear. wish i was helpful. take good care. best regards"

i doc my of and i had protected sex i done exactly know whether i ejaculated inside her or not but i have a doubt . to i made her take postpone 72 in about 23 hrs . that are the chances of her being pregnant . and how effective is postpone 72 . is there anything to worry ?,1,6010,"hi, when did your partner have her last census. the first seven days and the last seven days of menstrual cycle are considered safe. if you have had sex during this period you need not worry. if you have sex on days other than safe period then there is possibility of pregnancy. even one sperm is enough to cause pregnancy. so it is good that she took unwanted 72. unwanted 72 is very effective in preventing pregnancy. if taken within 24 hrs of unprotected sex it is 95% effective. so there is a small possibility of method failure resulting in pregnancy. if her period is delayed for more than a week from her due date she must do pregnancy test. to avoid such unnecessary stress i advise your partner to consult her doctor and start regular contraception like hormonal contraception or intrauterine devise as they are very effective in preventing pregnancy. i also advise you to use barrier method of contraception like condom to protect yourself from stds. i hope i have answered to your satisfaction. if you have any further queries do contact me through chat doctor"

a have dental pain in the left side of my mouth . i had very generalised intermittent dull ache for the last three weeks all over my mouth but now it is throbbing . by face is very sore to touch up to my nose and it is slightly swollen . a am surviving with ibuprofen . a visited my dentist who thinks a may be grinding my teeth . do you think it is dental or otherwise ?,1,34909,"hello, thanks for sharing your query. i have gone through your concern. it seems that the pain is generalized and after checking you clinically your dentist have not found any carious tooth or other pathology, and he might have observed the tooth wear, so he has asked the possibility of grinding the teeth. as per i think grinding the teeth causes the throbbing sensation on taking hot or cold foodstuff or cold air blow, and it is and is generally overall in all teeth not the one side. but it can be possible that teeth on one side can be wore out because of unusual batting habit but the systems occurs because of hot or cold foodstuffs and soreness to face is not seen. only the throbbing pain which is not continuous. if teeth grinding is the problem then you have to go for habit breakers and mouth-guards to avoid further damage to teeth and causal correction. it can be related to impacted wisdom tooth;then it has to be treated or gingival or periodontal pockets if teeth are loose.also, caries or the infection in the tooth can also result in swelling and soreness. i would advise you not to take medicine just to get short term relief instead try to find out the cause with your dentist and accordingly take the treatment. nothing to worry. just relax and get proper treatment. hope the information provided is helpful to you. take care. regards."

"hello doctor , a a 30 yrs , married since last 2 yrs , earlier a had two spontaneous abortion of 6 was . now i a on follicular study for past 2 cycles , this is my 3rd follicular study sitting . on 15th day my of is 14.5 * 12mm , of is small and of is 7mm . please suggest me what to do next , if this cycle i couldn't conceive ?",1,13108,"hi, i appreciate your query would clarify the report of your follicular study to you. on the 9th day, in the right and left ovaries (of and lof) - there was no df - which means, dominant follicle. again the same findings persisted till the 13th day, that is there was no dominant follicle in any of the ovaries. et - refers to endometrial thickness which was 8 mm on day 13. collection in pod was nil, which is normal. now, to explain a normal follicular study to you. by day 9, the ovaries start producing dominant follicles, that is among the many eggs present in the ovaries, one starts maturing to develop into the dominant egg for that month. by day 13 generally, if you have a regular 28-day menstrual cycle, the dominant egg reaches a size of 20 - 22 mm. generally on day 14, ovulation occurs, that is the mature dominant egg is released from the ovary, and it is then ready for fertilization by the sperm. this is the normal studyhowever, in your case, there is no dominant follicle seen till day 13, which means that you are having an ovulatory cycle. that is, no mature egg is developing for ovulation this month. anovulatory cycles are a major cause for not being able to conceive.pod (polycystic ovarian disease) is one of the leading causes of an ovulation, apart from other conditions. you need to consult a gynecologist, and undergo further investigations for pod to rule out the cause of this follicular study. also, you might require treatment and ovulation induction (medicines to stimulate formation of follicles in the ovary). in case your cycles are delayed (longer than 28 - 30 days), there is a minor possibility that your follicles are maturing later than normal, for e.g., in a 35-day cycle, the day of ovulation would be 14 days before periods, that is on day 20 or 21. hope this helped you."

"a patient comes into the office complaining of numbness in the left side of the face and difficulty walking , the patient is having difficulty with speech and is easily confused . that questions should you ask the patient and what appears to be the primary diagnosis ?",1,104553,"hi, as you mentioned the symptoms it looks like the patient had an early stroke. during the brain stroke every single minute is important. stroke can be assessed by experiencing the slurred speech, slowing of motor functions, unable to respond to commands. the first thing need is to get admit to a nearby hospital with a ct or an mri facility. if the brain stroke is on the left side on the ct or mri scan than the symptoms will be on the opposite side due to the pyramidal tracts of the nervous system. the design of the human body and its control system by nature is made such that left side of the brain support the right side of the body. once stroke comes rushing into and emergency room is always advised. within 3 hours of the first symptom noticed is of priority and importance. any delay in every minute will damage the brain more. as the blood supply to the brain is restricted by the clot and the damage to the neural tissues keeps continuing. so as soon as one notices the symptoms the earliest you should reach to the emergency room and start the treatment. well, what could have lead to stroke will be the high blood pressure findings are in common. ecg can be normal can be abnormal. ecg is done to rule out certain factors and focus the whole treatment plan on the brain stroke. that is the reason the ecg is always taken. brain stoke can be confined by symptoms and later my mri or a ct scan. post stroke if the physical disability is found then a physical therapist is taken into consideration along with the medication prescribed by the neurologist and the cardiologist. if patient has diabetes than a planetologist should be contacted for the medical part. i hope i have answered your query. if any you have in particular to ask or didn't understand i will surely help you in it."

"a patient comes into the office complaining of numbness in the left side of the face and difficulty walking , the patient is having difficulty with speech and is easily confused . that questions should you ask the patient and what appears to be the primary diagnosis ?",3,62448,"hi, thank you for providing the brief history of the patient. as you mentioned the patient is on the crutch and is there any chance of having pain in the legs? well that totally depends on how she has learned the crutch gait training. as there is always a specific way to use the crutch, frames, sticks, etc. if she learns properly she will not get any pain in the legs. also, for performing crutch walking, one needs to have a stronger arms and a strong torso including the sound limb to be the best if there is injury on other side. if both legs are weak then until the upper limb and torso are strong it is tough to walk easily. also, if the torso and upper limb are not stronger and still the patient is using the crutch then, what will happen is, the metabolism will be faster, and the body will consume more energy which will lead her into pain and aches. she can opt for the physical therapist and strengthen the muscles required for the propulsion of the gait, even if it performed by using the crutches. post undergoing the physical therapy, she might have the lot of opportunities to come closer to the functional activities at ease. with the grace of god i wish a speedy recovery. regardsjay in chat doctor."

a haven ate in three weeks because the pain of my wisdom tooth was so bad i couldn't eat but a got five teeth taken out on june 14nd when a chew its sore but no pain or puss in my gums so a know a done have a blood clot and only being surviving on super soft food and soups but my stool is pure lucid is this normal or is there something wrong with me ?,1,86792,"dear sir/ mam, i understand your problem. always when a tooth erupts, the tissue surrounding it will get swollen and become a bit red. then the teeth tear the gums and comes out. the gum tissue above the tooth will be always very loose until the tootchatdoctores out completely into mouth. this loose gum tissue allows food accumulation under it and it's difficult to clean. this may cause infection and pain in the gum tissue. so already swollen gum tissue now become even worse. the opposite teeth will now bite on this tissue. so first treatment option is to cut the loose tissue above the erupting wisdom teeth. its very simple procedure of 2 minutes. if the problem recur, then take an x-ray and assess whether the wisdom tooth is in proper angulation to come out into the mouth. if the space in the jawbone is not enough and if the orientation of wisdom tooth is not good, it cannot come out. it may damage the adjacent teeth also in that condition. so better to take it off. you can normally chew even without wisdom teeth. so no need to worry. hope your query is answered. please don't hesitate to contact be back for further doubts."

"a have switched from microgyon to dinette for my skin . i starting taking dinette on the first day of my period , granted it was at half eleven at night i still took it . and continued to for seven days . on the seventh day i had sex with my boyfriend and then continued to take the pill everyday as normal . i am now on the third day of my pill free week and no bleed . though i have pms symptoms , including a very swollen tummy as i get every month . i am wrecking my brain thinking in pregnant , i couldn't get a doctors appointment til friday and i really need reassurance ,",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

by nephew just turned 12 and he went to a small hospital . they took him by ambulance to rapid city so regional hospital . they say he has some respiratory problem . by other nephew said ebola or something like that . is that possible ? or do you think it is just another virus going around . a read a little on ebola and it does not seem like he would be able to get that in of small town of 400 people .,1,90927,"hi, i am chat doctor. i have read your message. i think i can help you. first, the symptoms that you have described are highly suggestive of seizures. here is why- 1. they come in night-seizures are commonly triggered when the patient sleeps or just around the sleep. of course, they can occur at other times too.2. they start from the leg and move up and then spread to the rest of the body.3. the episodes last 3-4 minutes and then resolves. i assume (you have not mentioned it) that it is never remembered by him, the episode that is. i think you should both take it very seriously. there is a high possibility that there is an intracranial problem that he is having which is extending and progressing undetected in the brain just because you do not want to visit a neurologist. i think you should meet a neurologist as soon as possible and request an mri brain (with spectroscopy if needed) and video eeg. if he does turn out to have a pathology, treatment will have to be initiated for the pathology in addition to regular anti-epileptic medicines. i suggest taking a video of these episodes that he is having. it may help convince him that he needs to visit a doctor, and it may be helpful to the doctor in seeing the condition that your husband has. yes, you need to visit a neurologist as soon as possible. ideally, i would also like to know if he has been having headaches for the past years? does he seem to be having episodes where he does not recollect what he has been doing for a certain duration of time? you may need to talk to his colleagues at work and find out if he has been having seizures or any abnormal behavior at work. there is a high chance that he knows that he has been having seizures at work and not telling you about it. i have tried my best to help you. unfortunately, i cannot initiate / suggest medicines as long as the diagnosis is not confirmed because the anti-epileptics may have severe side effects. best of luck,"
