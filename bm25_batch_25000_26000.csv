i . ira my name is melissa and a just wanted to no if pm pregnant torture my period came on the 24th or 25th of last month and still hast came this month a had unprotected sex last month the and then took a morning after pill .. and then had unprotected sex again beginning of this month ....... could a be pregnant or could it be the pill this messing my period up ..... also have somme of the pregnancy symptoms white creamy discharge,1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"a am on a birth control pill and have been on it since the end of june ... about 15-16 days ago i was suppose to start my period . a was roughly a day or two late , but had very light bleeding ... 1-2 tampons a day bleeding ... three days ago my lower back started hurting really bad . it felt/feels like a fist is being drove into my lower spine near the tailbone ... when the back pain started i also started bleeding again with a lot of blood clots ... am i having a miscarriage ?",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

(considering your period of 30 days). so the ovulation day falls on 8 feb. thus the fertile period would be from 3 february till 11 feb. if your period is different from 30 days, please add or subtract those many days in this calculation. according to your calculation, the fertile period starts on 2 feb. so the chances of pregnancy due to intercourse on 31 jan. are remote, though cannot be completely excluded, since variation by couple of days has to be expected. it is too close to the fertile period. though there was no ejaculation, you cannot exclude pre-ejaculation fluid passage which happens unknowingly. it does contain some sperms which are capable of fertilizing an ovum. so though the maximum chances of conception are due to sex on 2 feb., for legal purpose, you may opt for dna test to ascertain the paternity. i hope this helps you."

(hide scan) is a nuclear imaging procedure to evaluate the health and function of the gallbladder. a radioactive tracer, usually technetium-99 m, is injected through any accessible vein, then allowed to circulate to the liver, where it is excreted into the biliary system and stored by the gallbladder and biliary system. in the absence of disease, the gallbladder is visualized within 1 hour of the injection of the radioactive tracer. if the gallbladder is not visualized within 4 hours after the injection, this indicates either cholecystitis or cystic duct obstruction. so it depends on the time at which image is taken. diagnosis also varies according to the variation in image n the time of taking an image after injection of radiotracer. so your radiologist who did the procedure n saw the images of hide scan can answer your question better. i hope this will be helpful to you."

"hello , a was recently treated for cystitis on saturday in the of and was prescribed bactria . a feel like a have more itching and am going to the bathroom even more . also a also nowhere an occasional annoying cough . is this normal ? a still have 5 doses left .",2,82366,"hello friend, thank you for posting your query through chat doctor. i am a homeopath answering your query and the answer which i am going to give you may contain several thoughts which may appear strange or new for you. this i say because homeopathy is a new system of medicine and is almost unheard by the majority of the population. therefore, due to the high influence of the conventional medicine the people at large are brainwashed to believe and act according to the health education given by them. coming back to the fibroadenoma of your left breast in the year 1979, you had a psychological conflict in the mind level. you are a sensitive individual and that is why your left breast was affected. it must have been related with your child chat doctor. the sensitivity is genetic, and you reacted to the conflict through the brain according to a genetic programming. mind-brain - organ affection resulted in the development of a lump in your left breast in 1979. you consulted your gynecologist, and he suggested that it may turn to become cancerous in future and so it is better to remove it, and you subdued to his suggestion. actually the lump in the breast was an attempt of the body to cure you, or it was the result of a self defense mechanism. since you had not resolved the conflict in the psychological level, the lump remained there without getting resolved. but the body kept the lump protected in a cyst with minimum amount of inflammation called chronic cystitis. by removing the fibroadenoma or chronic cystic mastitis, you were not cured, but your lump in the breast was removed. in 1995 also you are the same person, you are the same sensitive person, and you underwent another more serious psychological conflict and the same left breast was again affected in a more serious manner. instead of recognizing the mass as a defense mechanism, you got the fear in you that you have cancer. the tissue changes also suggested that there is more serious pathology, and they labelled your lump this time as cancer and suggested removal of your left breast. if you could have recognized the lump as a defense mechanism and if you had no fear of cancer, you could have retained your breast. but the fear of cancer is such that it is associated with death and so you lost your breast. in no case, either by removal of lump in 1979 or by removal of your breast in 1995, you are not cured only your disease is cured. hope by this time you have got the answer for your query. both are related to each other because they are in the same individual, same sensitivity, same program. homeopathy cures the person and once the individual is cured all his diseases will be cured. with best wishes,"

"a have been experiencing irregular heart beats and skipping beats over the past three days . by heart rate is about normal ( 52-55 per minute ) , but it skips and then races . a have been incredibly tired , and when this happens , a get a slight rush when the heart beat resumes . a also just realized that a have a slight fever ( about .8 degrees ) . is this anxiety or caffeine caused ? should a just take a clonazepam or something like that ?",1,25338,"hello and thank you for using chat doctor. i carefully read your question and understand your concern. but you should not worry, its nothing serious. as you describe, my opinion is that it might be a rhythm issue. someone can feel strong and fast heart beats for different reasons. it may be a simple sinus tachycardia. this means that the heart is beating faster than 100 beats for minute. its normal range in a resting condition is between 60-100 beats for minute. when it goes up you may feel a strong heart beat in your chest and a sensation like your body is beating too. another reason for this sensation might be what we call an ekstrasystol.these is electrical heart impulses that generates in some parts of heart different from normal sinus rhythm. this generates an escaped beat that the person feels like jumping ore bumping. it gives the sensation like a beat is skipping, may experience palpitations or an anxiety sensation that your daughter explains like trembling. this extrasistoles may happen from different reasons from simple emotional stress to other pathologies like anemia, hyperthyroidism etc. so, my opinion as cardiologist is that you have nothing to worry. it is just a simple episode, and it is quite normal in younger ages. only if these symptoms persist and begins to interfere the daily live, if i was your treating doctor i will recommend some examinations like a blood analysis to exclude anemia, the thyroid hormones, an electrocardiogram, echocardiography and of course a holder monitoring. this will help us to document and see what happens with heart rhythm. at meantime, i will recommend your daughter to avoid coffee, caffeine products because they rise heart frequency and extrasistolic beats. i encourage her to have physical training because sometimes it helps in reducing extrasistoles, tachycardia, even making them disappear. wish i was helpful. take good care. best regards"

"hello or , a had high triglyceride 422 & had been advised to take fenofibrate 175mg for the past 3 months i have been taking this continuously , from last week i have pain on my right side of chest & 6 looks like something is holding in deliver , after making a scanning the report suggested mild enlargement of live & fatty liver , the or made alt gpt ) 56 & alt spt 76 . he advised me ismail 160 my 2 times daily , but i still have pain in liver sometimes good , hcv & hepatitis a is negative made new tests . kindly advise .",1,28200,"hi, i had gone through your question and understand your concerns. firstly, i must stress that one or a few of the liver function tests should not be interpreted in isolation. the entire hepatic function panel should be ideally be available along with the normal laboratory reference ranges for a meaningful interpretation. you have provided only the ast and alt values. therefore, i can only answer in general terms. serum aminotransferases: are of two types.- alpine aminotransferase (alt) and- aspartame aminotransferase (ast). elevations of these are the two of the most useful indicators of liver cell injury. the ast is less live specific than the alt. elevations of the ast level may also be seen in acute muscle injury, (cardiac or skeletal muscle). mild degrees of alt level elevation may occasionally be seen in skeletal muscle injury or even after vigorous physical exercise. disproportionate elevations of the ast and alt levels when compared with the alkaline phosphatase level arise in diseases that primarily affect hepatocytes (ex; viral hepatitis). the ast/alt ratio is not very useful in determining the cause of liver injury, except in acute alcoholic hepatitis, wherein, the ratio is usually > 2 and the ast level is 400 iu/ml or lower. common causes of mild increases in ast and alt levels is fatty liver disease seen most often in the context of obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and alcohol abuse. the ratio of ast to alt may give additional clues as to the cause:- in chronic liver disease with early cirrhosis alt > ast,- in chronic liver disease with established cirrhosis ast > alt. extremes of the ratio of ast:alt may also be sometimes useful:- ratio >2 suggests alcoholic hepatitis, and-do not worry. it will take around 6 months for the enzymes to be normal again. hope this answers your question. if you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. i will be happy to answer your questions. wishing your daughters good health."

i have bad spring seasonal allergies and of the past when of rains a would feel good but i notice when of rains recently a seem of of getting really sick instead of feeling good like of the past . of allergies also seem of of lasting longer than usual .,1,74247,"greetings, welcome to chat doctor. chronic sinusitis is a very common condition these days. and people tend to have surgeries to get rid of it, but complete cure is usually not achieved. well there are many reasons for this long term issue but one of the most common problem that i notice in my clinic is that either the patient rides a motorbike and is exposed to fast blowing air or has had history of different allergies to different environmental factors. so foremost question here would be if you have either of these problems. secondly these problems is also common in those people who are used to keep the temperature of their air conditions of the car, office or the house very low. as they shift from cooler environment like the indoor to outside heat there is sudden change in temperature which worsens nasal congestion and hence sinusitis worsens.therefore, i would suggest that instead of taking too much of medication and surgeries, you should take care of all the above-mentioned factors and avoid mucus collection in the sinus altogether. to avoid allergies, it is advisable to visit an allergy clinic and sensitization protocols should be followed to reduce episodes of sinusitis due to allergies like pollen allergies. i hope the answer was helpful. in case of further assistance, feel free to contact in writing. chat doctor."

"hello dr. via fund my name is latisha shivers and a am 34 years of age and a been going thought some female issues . a been on birth control since high school and until now and a been having on and off bleeding and a also been through several different types of birth control and it seems like the same constant bleeding keeps on recurring . now as we speak a went to another doctor for an second opinion today and she told me to take one pill in the morning , and one pill at night . now dr. fund a done feel comfortable with that but for and three opinion am a suppose to do that because a really want to which to the patch.i",1,77098,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. many women who have been on birth control for many years can develop a tolerance of sorts for the pills' ability to control your menstrual cycle, especially after they have not menstruated for a long time due to pregnancy or another cause. this can also occur to the fact that you did relatively recently give birth, especially if you were breastfeeding. bleeding when you are not supposed to have your period on the pill is called breakthrough bleeding. it does not mean the pill is ineffective as a contraceptive, but having some irregular bleeding in between periods or a different bleeding pattern that you may have had before the pregnancy is not unusual. having heavy bleeding in the morning is likely due to the blood accumulating in your vagina during the night, and then it all comes out at once when you get out of bed due to gravity. your cycle may get back to normal after a few more months on the pill, and taking it as close to the same time every day will help to reduce the risk of breakthrough bleeding. if it continues for more than 3 months, you may benefit from changing your birth control brand to one with a slightly higher dose of estrogen, as the estrogen in the pill is the ingredient that controls your menstrual cycle. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

a was diagnosed with fibromuscular dysplasia of the right internal carotid artery at the base of my skull . a was told 17 years ago the technology did not exist to do a bypass on the artery . is the technology there now and do a need to have it rechecked ? a have been on warfarin ever since to keep the blood as thin as possible .,1,72880,"hello. thank you for your question and welcome to chat doctor. i carefully read your query. puncture site-related complications of the coronary angiogram/coronary angioplasty do not take one and a half months to be produced and become worrisome. actually, they are seen immediately to six hours after the procedure. a pain or numbness or coldness on a certain limb indeed indicates problems with the blood flow to that limb, but i do not think that there is a connection between the femoral artery puncture and the leg numbness of your leg, in this case, at least. as an invasive cardiologist, i, too, check the pulses periodically, after the procedure, and good and filled pulses indicate that there is nothing wrong with the femoral artery and distally placed arteries. however, in my experience, there have been a few cases similar with yours, where, after all the tests have been done, was concluded that the psychological effect was to be found blaming. if this is a worrisome phenomenon to you, i would recommend you to do an echo-doppler of the arteries of the limb, to conclude if there is any problem with the arteries of that limb, related or not with the procedural puncture site. i hope i have been of help. kind regards,"

"a have a question about sarcomas . now is it that , as malignant tutors arising from mesenchyme tissues , they appear grossly as fleshy tutors ? especially something like a fibroma or fibrosarcoma , which are made of fibrous connective tissue , shouldn't they be hard like a scar ?",1,25283,"hi, thanks for writing in. tissues are made of living cells whether they are arising from fibrous tissue or not. malignancy is a change that brings about uncontrolled proliferation of tissues in the area of cancer. fibrous tissue contains more of fibrous elements and is not exactly hard or like a scar. it contains cellular and extracellular components including fibrous cells. there is also stoma between the fibrous cells that contains cells. since these are living tissues they contain specialized cells and also have cell structure. the concept of hardness is true when considering malignancy, but it will not be rock hard. it is somewhat firm in nature. these features can be better studied using cartography and is being applied in the research of breast malignancy and there is a hypothesis that hard non-compressible tumors can become cancer."

"air one of a tooth broke and the sharp edge was constantly hitting my tongue for two days.then i got a root canal done.now i have a small ulcer and pain in the tongue plus also one side of the throat i can see whitish structure and painful , difficulty in swallowing .. plus suggest me remedy or medications",1,35390,hi. can understand your concern. as per your complaint you have got two crowns placed and pain after this can be due to either of the following reasons. one reason can be in case if the crowns were placed without root canal treatment of tooth (it is a treatment in which the nerves and blood vessels present in the tooth are cut off either to relieve pain due to infection or as an intentional procedure to avoid complications like pain and sensitivity after crown placement) the preparation of the tooth for seating the crown if done in excess can lead to opening of nerves and when the crown is placed over opened nerves it can cause inflammation of nerve and hence severe pain. in case if the crowns are placed after root canal treatment for an infected tooth pain can be due to persistent infection leading to pus formation and pressure which is not subsided or there is some vital nerve tissue left out in any missed root canal can cause severe pain on crown placement. i would suggest you to consult an endodontist and get evaluated clinically as well as by getting x-ray done to rule out the cause of pain. in case if root canal is not done and pain is due to irritated nerves the crown needs to be removed followed by root canal treatment and medicines and once pain is completely subsided crown can be placed again. in case of root canal treated tooth also re treatment will have to be done. you can take painkiller like eugenic plus or retool dt (one tablet dissolved in half a glass of water) to provide relief. hope your query is solved. if you find the answer helpful please write a positive review and click on find this answer helpful as a token of appreciation. thanks and regards. chat doctor.

"a have just been informed that a have excessive enzymes in my liver , this was established through a fasting blood test , the doctor also mentioned something about out but was very vague . be has recommended a come in 5 months for a further blood test , is this a wise move or should a be investigating this further now ?",1,70463,"hello have gone through your question and understood your concern. fasting blood sugar (fbs) measures blood glucose after you have not eaten for at least 8 hours. it is the first test done to check for prediabetes and diabetes. if you were not fasting, then the result can not be taken in consideration for the diagnosis of pre-diabetes or diabetes. in my opinion, this result can be considerate like a random blood sugar (rbs) and measures blood glucose regardless of when you last ate. random testing is useful because glucose levels in healthy people do not vary widely throughout the day and blood glucose levels that vary widely may mean a problem. this test is also called a casual blood glucose test. it is true that your age, positive family history and being african american are risc factors for diabetes. but the test result can not be taken in consideration for the diagnosis because it is not fasting. a fasting blood sugar level from 100 to 125 mg/dl is considered prediabetes. if its 126 mg/dl or higher or a random blood sugar level of 200 mg/dl or higher ; on two separate tests, you have diabetes.(actually, if you were fasting, 129 mg/dl can be suggestive of diabetes not prediabetes and the next step will be to repeat the test for the confirmation of the diagnosis)in my opinion you don't have reason to be concerned because the test result is not a fasting but a random measurement, and we can not reach the diagnosis only with this test. so, be patient because the true fasting test will give the exact information about your situation. hope this is helpful. if you have other debts, feel free and ask. best regards."

"in the past month , ave developed four spider veins on my face . a have never had them before . would this be caused by my birth control pill ? a was on the pill years ago and started it again in october . or could this be a result of using the fluocinonide prescribed to reduce redness on my nose ? is there any way to get rid of the veins ?",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

hello sir .i have very less facial hair.i consulted an endocrinologist and got the testosterone level tested .according to that it was normal.i am 25 now and still lack thick beard and moustache as other men do.can you please suggest me a remedy for this ? ?,1,16123,"hi john thanks for posting on chat doctor john it just takes some men longer for their facial and body hair to fill out, but it eventually does for most people. although some males are just hairier than others and the amount of hair you have is not an absolute indicator of testosterone levels. the basic cause is genetics in most of the cases. you can look at the men folk on your maternal and paternal sides of the family to get an idea of what your genetic traits are, as they relate to hair, you inherit these genes predominately from your mothers side. although if you are very concerned about your testosterone levels you can visit any doctor and get s. testosterone levels tested by a simple blood test. if the levels are abnormal or low, which is very unlikely, do visit an endocrinologist for the further management. but once your beard/mustache fills in, and you have to shave every day, you may wish it was back how it is now! god bless"

28-year old man : a lump/bump on the upper arm and on top of the shoulder appeared suddenly one after another within 2 days . one of them ( on the holder ) is almost round and the other one ( on the upper arm ) is ellipsoid-like and is about 1.5 long and about 2/3 wide . that could that be ?,1,97171,"hi dear, understanding your concern. painless clicking of the shoulder is common, normal and frequently bilateral. the exact causes are not entirely known, but it is thought to be related to altered sudden pressures within the joints or burial cavities. painful clicking, however, is most likely pathological. popping shoulders with burning sensation could be because of pinched nerve. the term pinched nerve designates a type of injury or damage to a nerve or set of nerves, most commonly resulting from compression, constriction, or stretching of the surrounding area. a pinched nerve may also result from arthritis. the severity of this condition can range from minor and temporary to long-lasting and serious. pinched nerves often result from activity and movement in work and recreational settings. it could be because of rotator cuff tear means damage to one or more of the four tendons that cover the shoulder joint and connect the shoulder bone to the collarbone. a torn rotator cuff is usually caused by injury in which the tendon is overstretched or resulting from a direct blow. this condition can also occur as a result of repeated minor injury or overuse that weaken the tendon. the mainstays of treatment include rest, anti-inflammatory medication and treatment. treatment for rotator cuff disorders should always consist of rotator cuff strengthening exercises. perform the exercise with a light dumbbell. lie on the side, holding the dumbbell in the hand of the upper arm. position the elbow of the upper arm against the rib cage to avoid movement other than external rotation. externally rotate the arm through full range of motion. this will increase blood circulation to that area and your problem will be solved. hoping your concern has been solved. get back to me if any further query is there."

"by husband has had cramping of one leg for many years but now both when walking up hills , he now has one leg smaller . is father had peripheral vascular disease and had one leg amputated . by husband smokes about twenty per day . is diet is good eating nuts and vegetables every night .",1,5481,"hi there, im sorry to hear about the medical problems your father is having. when i hear the symptoms that your father is having, the first thing that comes to my mind is claudication. claudication is pain while walking due to arterial insufficiency- basically, the muscles in the legs don't get enough blood flow when they are being used, and they start to ache. this is caused by peripheral vascular disease and is common in smokers, diabetics, and patients with high cholesterol levels. these patients will often have a history of coronary artery disease and sometimes renal problems as well. the first thing i would recommend is for your father to start a waking regiment and walk consistently every day. he should aim to walk for about 30 minutes a day. if he cants do 30 minutes, he should do as much as he can, and then try to do a little more each day. the most important thing is daily consistency - he has to do it every day, not just one or two times a week. i'd also recommend he check his cholesterol levels, and if they are high a statin such as lipitor (atorvastatin) can help lower his levels and prevent further damage. finally, if he continues to have problems with walking after 6 months of a dedicated walking problem, then he should see a vascular surgeon and have his arterial vessels looked at in his leg with ultrasound. i hope this is helpful. please contact me with any questions."

"a had protected sex with my boyfriend about a month or so ago on my infertile day , the same month i got my period on time it was very normal , heavy and it lasted the usual amount of days ( 5 ) . the condom was perfect and he didst ejaculated . but i heard that even after a heavy and normal period a girl can still be pregnant ? can i be pregnant ?",1,25588,"hello, you have protected sex on infertile days. so there is no chance of pregnancy.don't be much worried.also, you got normal period. practice always safe sex in the future. heavy period in one cycle is not significant until it happens in every cycle. it may be due to hormonal imbalance or uterine pathology. so if you got heavy period in every month, then do a usg scan for pelvis and consult with gynecologist. be well."

"i , my period is 3 months late already . is there a possibility that a might be pregnant ? be have an unprotected sexual intercourse with my of 3 days after my period last september 4 . a done experience spotting . last few months we have a vigorous training and a suffer from weight loss . but now , a was wondering why a have clear nipple discharge from both of nipples .",1,72620,"hallow dear, the duration of pregnancy when counted from the last menstrual period is 280 days or 9 calendar months and 7 days. in fact the egg is released (ovulation) 14 days prior to the next expected menses; i.e. if the cycle is of 30 days the egg will be released on day 16 of the cycle. the egg has 24 hours life while the sperms are active for 72 hours. hence, the conception can happen about a week around the day of ovulation. considering this, for practical purpose we consider 2 weeks less from the day of ovulation (or conception). so the pregnancy precisely is of 266 days. however, for the sake of convenience, we calculate it as 280 days from the last menstrual period date. considering these facts, if the delivery date is to be expected on september 30, the last menstrual period date should be 23 december. (would you be having it then?) now your cycle is of 30 days period. so the expected date of ovulation should be 07 january. hence, if the conception takes place on 07 january, the due date of delivery would be 30 september. the hitch here is that you should have ovulation taking lace on 07 january. moreover, we have noticed that all the pregnancies do not last for 280 days. the delivery can take place any time between 3 weeks earlier to 1 week later than the expected due date of delivery. keeping these facts and calculations in mind, you may plan your sexual relations accordingly. i hope this will help you."

"hey ... i had my chest a ray done today ... the report shows no active lesions . but there is thick vascular markings in both lungs ..... hila are enlarged ..... other things are normal .... i was having heaviness in chest , mild pain and pressure on the backside of chest .... and difficulty in breathing as if shortness of breath ( just like gastric problem in chest )",1,15927,"hi, thanks for writing in. the first ct might have been done for the chest, and you probably had discomfort and breathing problems. there is no pulmonary embolus shows no blood clot in the lungs. hiatal hernia is a condition where there is upwards movement of the stomach and this is mild and therefore not a serious problem, and you might be aware about it. this can cause acid reflux symptoms. the pancreas is a soft organ and is tadpole in shape. some people can have a bulky head region of pancreas, and probably it is there in your scan. if you are doing well without any problems in digestion and if there is no abdominal pain then your pancreas is a sort of normal variation. this is common and found in many patients. the pancreas is slightly prominent for this reason, and it is not a problem. please do not worry."

hi i was just wandering about this my grandson at 15 years has been fighting against cancer since january at last he is in remission now his sister has had a blood test and the doctor has phoned to say her limphonoid count is low and needs another blood test wot could this mean,1,44798,"hi, thanks for writing in. your brother is a strong person and has been fighting cancer of esophagus for 7 months now. pain is a subjective sensation and no two people can experience the same degree of pain. in your brother, it is possible that the cancer in the esophagus is irritating surrounding sensory nerves that carry pain sensation. this pain is being transmitted to the higher center in brain and that is why he needs morphine to suppress it. a fight with cancer is allowed to go on as long possible. your husband might have had a cancer that was less infiltrating the nerves and his pain tolerance was good. in my opinion, cancer patients with stents can live up to over a year on semi-solid and liquid diet and if the cancer does not infiltrate fast inside the stent lumen. please allow as much pain relief possible after discussing with his doctor,"

a am worried since my tongue is developing kind of a bald spot on the tip of my tongue . it first a thought it was due to my retainer rubbing it raw since a have a turner dial in my retainer right where the spot started . however a have not worn my retainer for a couple of weeks and the spot is getting bigger . that is happening ?,1,40825,"thanks for your query. i have gone through your query. the gap between the teeth can be treated with retainers. get a new set of retainers and get it activated. you have to wear this for 2-3months. once the gap is closed, then you can get a permanent retainer done on the inner aspect of the teeth, so that there won't be any relapse further. it is better to get a permanent retainer done and this is the permanent solution. these retainers are fixed along the inner surface of your teeth so that it will not be visible outside, and it is just a small wire that is placed over the teeth unlike the removable retainer, where it comes as a plate. i hope my answer will help you. take care."

"i have severe cold symptoms for which i am having medication but suddenly my right side upper jaw started hurting and cant understand the reason . teeth are fine and in regular with dentists so do you advice me to have ordent ( ofloxacin with ornidazole ) tablets . thanks , sandeep sachdeva",1,44241,"hello, i can understand your concern. it would have been easier to advise you if you had mentioned the pain is in the upper or lower jaw. i am answering for both possibilities. if it is in the lower jaw, it could be due to an impacted third molar, the wisdom tooth that is stuck in the jaw, trying to come out, but probably there is less physical space available for it to come out, so it is locked and causing pressure and pain in jaw and gums. to confirm this diagnosis, your dentist can take an x-ray (iowa) or you can go for opg (more preferable) that will show all teeth of your mouth. if the pain is in the upper jaw, third molar possibility can be considered for that, too. however, sometimes severe sinusitis can cause pain in upper teeth and gums. are you having symptoms of sinusitis, like cold, congestion, headache etc.? do u feel pain if pressed in the area below eye and around cheek area on left side? if yes, then this is the possibility, which can be solved by an ent specialist. taking a painkiller like ibuprofen 400 mg or acetaminophen 500 mg 8-hourly will help till diagnosis is made. i hope this advice helps you. thank you for choosing chat doctor. let me know if you have follow-up questions. best,"

"hi , can you help me ? i had my period last month twice but i have regular menstruation ever since . and in 27y/o and in trying to get pregnant . i had blighted pregnancy 2008 . that is the possible way to get pregnant ? in also taking ferrous sulfite w/ folic acid to help",1,19436,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. any woman having unprotected sex is at risk for pregnancy, so it certainly is possible that you may have conceived your first month. however, 80 percent of couples will conceive within one year, so if you divide that by 12 (for each month) you have about a 6 percent chance of conceiving per cycle. sperm live in the female genital tract for up to 72 hours, so it is generally recommended when trying to get pregnant to have sex every other day between the time your period finishes and the time you feel pms symptoms (which means you have already ovulated and can no longer conceive that cycle). so i would try to be patient and understand that it sometimes can take some time to become pregnant. in the meantime, i recommend you try to eat a healthy diet, get plenty of rest, avoid alcohol and smoking and begin to take folic acid, which is a b vitamin that has been shown to help prevent birth defects. 400 micrograms daily is the standard dose, which can be purchased alone or in prenatal vitamin preparations. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and i wish you the best of luck getting pregnant! best wishes,"

i have lots of gas in stomach causes uncomfortable sensations in stomach and problems with vision . when i take phi a it seems to agitate vision even more and makes concentration even more difficult . had acupuncture previously and had work on liver and gallbladder done . would i be better doing a liver gallbladder cleanse,1,67268,"hello, shake, if you have been diagnosed to have gallstones, especially, multiple, then removal of gallbladder is the definitive treatment as a cure. you can live without a gallbladder which is essentially a storage organ. bile is produced in the liver and carried to the gallbladder. it releases the bile periodically after meals to help with digestion. even after the gallbladder is removed, bile now comes into the intestine directly and helps with digestion. in some people, there could be diarrhea from bile irritation on the lining of the intestine, but his is temporary and gets better with time. as for recuperation, it is faster since the surgery is done through laparoscope, and it is same day in and out surgery. as for as fatty liver is concerned, it depends on the grades. grade 0-1 or even grade-2, is completely reversible with proper diet, weight control, sugar control and lipid control. you should consider taking super b-complex vitamin daily, along with 1000 mg. of vital and 800 i.u. of vitae daily. these will help. if you have not had complete liver tests, get it to see how the enzyme levels are. if they are normal, you don't have to worry. i wish you well."

"by period is over a week late , & a have already taking a pregnancy test , whicchatdoctore back negative . ave noticed that not only does my stomach hurts a little , but a have also been using the bathroom a little more than usual.do a think all of these incidents may have something to do with kidney problems ?",1,105473,"hi, thanks for the query. since you have used birth control pills irregularly and also used plan b, it is difficult to predict when you will have a period. even with this, in most cases, for women using birth control pills, periods will come only after the active pills are over despite using plan b in the middle of the cycle. plan b works in more than 90% cases if taken properly. concomitant use of both does not decrease the efficacy of plan b, and it still works. it works by delaying ovulation and changing the lining of the uterus to prevent pregnancy from occurring. it does not work if pregnancy has already occurred. the best way to know if you are pregnant in this case would be to take a pregnancy test at least 3-3 1/2 week after using plan b using a morning urine sample. if it is negative, chances of pregnancy resulting from the sexual act on that day [before you took plan b] are negligible. another way to know is wait for your period while taking the sugar pills, if it is delayed a pregnancy test 7 days after the missed period will help. hope you find this useful. thanks for using chat doctor, and have a good day. chatdoctor bagdeconsultant obstetrician and gynecologist"

"every time a put my 1 year old daughter in her highchair or car seat , she will push her bottom against the center restraint and keeps rubbing against her groin area as if it itches , there are no rashes at all . her doctor says she is just uncomfortable , but now she would jump on my stomach and do the same type of rubbing . that is going on and how can a stop it ?",1,36910,"hello, welcome to the chatdoctorbrief. do not take stress on that and don't let her feel that she is overweight. detailed answer... weight measurements can change time by time, since she is going to end prepubertal stage, and some time hormonal change can effect on body mass index and metabolism. as this is growing age and don't pull her to think much about the weight, just encourage her to have food on time and divide in 6 meals in a day with plenty of fruits and vegetables. cycling could be enjoyable and helpful for her too. depression is just a thought which can be increased if someone is thought much about it. have faith on her and make her feel that it is fine that she has 38 kg weight, no problem in that at all. make her feel that she is especial. hopefully my answer will be helpful. chat doctor."

a have sever pain in my right thumb and it goes into my wrist . by thumb is swollen so a can to bed it all the way down . a a not sure what a did to it other than used and electric knife for a couple hours on and off cutting sweet corn and it has hurt ever since,1,34552,"the only thing for a cold sensation i can think of is acid reflux. when you get heart burn it feels crazy and can give anxiety (hence the rapid heart rate). you can remedy acid reflux (herd, or heart burn, throat burn or whatever you want to call it) by getting some digestive enzymes (try something like source naturals daily digestive enzymes) at a local vitamin store (or try vitacost.com) and till give her enough digestive juices to help grind up her food better. also, food intolerances will cause problems too. i discovered a food intolerance to wheat, milk and peanuts. but you have to write down how you feel after you eat something and try eliminating it for a while and see how it goes. you can ask a doctor for an elisa test (for food allergies) but it doesn't tell us much. a food elimination/rotation diet is much better plus it can't hurt. a sharp knife like feeling is definitely heart burn from what i've felt or heard about. make sure you write down when these things occur, what time and how long (dates) and what she had to eat earlier. pizza is a biggie on heart burn. hot dogs, anything with bad fats in it. bread if she is intolerant to wheat and so on. i would throw in a thyroid (tsh) test for hyper or hypothyroidism. so many symptoms stem from those diseases (difficulty breathing, rapid heart rate, digestion issues and so on)...that it should be warranted just to rule it out. and if it keeps happening see the doc. but sometimes i do believe we have to be our own detectives. my dd has a friend that was ill on and off for a couple of years and saw 11 doctors (hello, aren't they supposed to be intelligent beings?) but no, they couldn't figure out anything. finally, they figured out she has a gluten-allergy."

a have a five year old daughter who is giving problems to eat.she does not take any main meals that i give her.she only likes food stuffs like ice cream and biscuits.am afraid since her weight is reducing she will get sick as she does not take in proteins and vitamin c.kindly advice,2,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

(as you said he has difficulty in walking now). you can also say to his parents that --- they can continue with all religious customs along with medicines, may be then they will agree... with medicine, he will start showing improvement in few days only... it is psychosis and patients will not agree to go to any doctor willingly, so you might need to take him forcefully. this is well accepted as it is for his benefit only. even if he doesn't agree for oral medicine there are injectables which are given to such patients... take the right step, take him to a doctor. hope the reply is useful feel free to ask more questions"

well i smoked for about five years and then on day when i smoked my hearts started beating really fast and i threw up .... i was tingling throughout my whole body and my chest got really tight .... keep in mind i smoked many many times before and it never happened ... what is going on ?,1,11024,"hello, and thank you for consulting chat doctor. i believe you are suffering chronically from anxiety; the recent episode was quite likely a panic attack. the hemorrhage you suffered 5 years ago may have resulted in some brain changes which contribute to your anxiety. there is no way to be certain, and it doesn't really matter. what matters is getting the anxiety and panic under control. obviously you have been excessive with your use of pot recently. marijuana can assist in the control of anxiety, but, as with all things, moderation is key. often the dosage and effects of orally ingested pot (as in pot butter), are much greater than when it is smoked. my suggestion is to be consistent with your use of pot, if you intend to continue using it, and avoid excessive amounts. you should ask around for the name of a good therapist who can help you understand and control your anxiety and panic. this is essential. there are very effective techniques out there! if you continue to lose weight unintentionally, discuss this with your physician. best of luck.... and hope this has helped.ez"

a just saw that what a thought was swollen ankles is actually a tutor like growth on my left ankle and most all of my bones have been hurting for a couple of months but mostly in my hands and feet . a went to my doctor and she prescribed vitamin a .it has helped some but not enough is this bone cancer,1,36536,"hi, thanks for writing in. any cancer, including that of hepatocellular cancer is an evolving diagnosis. this condition is more common in those who have active alcohol intake or might be infected with hepatitis b or hepatitis c. in my opinion, there is no direct negligence on part of the doctor but doing ultrasound scan of his abdomen at that time might have helped. even if the hepatocellular cancer is most likely to be a recent development, any suspicious activity in the liver might have been known if this investigation was done earlier. it is not usual that all people with swollen feet have hepatocellular cancer but swelling in feet can be due to problems involving liver, kidney, heart or thyroid and other conditions. it will help to know the size of the hepatocellular cancer right now and then seek the right treatment at a cancer hospital in your area. early stages of cancer can be treated by surgery and intensive chemotherapy. please do not worry."
