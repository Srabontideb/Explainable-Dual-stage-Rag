"i , does fatty liver have symptoms ? a sometimes feel pressure on my right side , a couple of inches below where the ribs split . a was told a have fatty liver . that can a do for it and is it reversible ? is the pressure from fatty liver or something else like acid reflux ?",1,94278,"hello! i have been through your question. related your concern i think that you should know that the elevated levels of alt/ast is moderate, and usually fatty liver is the most common cause of unexplained persistent elevation of liver enzyme levels after hepatitis and other chronic liver diseases have been excluded. the good news is that fatty liver is a reversible condition that can be resolved with changed behaviors and often has no symptoms and typically does not cause permanent damage. but when fatty liver is caused by an underlying condition, it can become harmful to the liver if the cause is not recognized and treated. the most common cause of fatty liver is alcoholism and other common causes obesity, hyperlipidemia, diabetes some medications. you should know that potential causes of liver transaminase elevations include viral hepatitis, alcohol use, medication use, stenosis, and cirrhosis. so what i suggest for your wife in this situation is doing a physical examination by a hepatologist, exclude viral hepatitis (lab test bag and anti hcv), abdominal ultrasound to see the local situation of your fatty liver and to exclude cirrhosis and lipidograme. furthermore, a liver biopsy definitively allows excluding alternate causes of elevated liver enzymes, and it is the only method to distinguish (in certainty) non-alcoholic fatty liver from non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and it provides information on the stage of the disease. but it belongs the hepatologist, based on your data to decide to do or not a liver biopsy because as all invasive procedures exist some risks. i hope my answer help you."

"i am having generalized anxiety disorder for last two years . when a write with my right hand , it shakes ( trembling ) and writing is not legible . earlier , a was having falling tendency but it has come down substantially of late . whom should i see , please advise .",1,92350,"hi and welcome to chat doctor ... thanks for your question. from your question i gather that you become excessively nervous and have trembling of your hands, especially during social situations. so, in other words, you seem to be having an ""anxiety"" problem... generally, anxiety can manifest itself in two ways: 1) psychological... i.e. feeling nervous, tensed, unable to relax, etc. and 2) somatic... i.e. bodily symptoms like trembling of hands, rapid beating of the heart, sweating, etc. now, it is important to know whether your anxiety is confined only to social situations or whether you keep experiencing some anxiety most of the time and are unable to relax completely. if your anxiety is only confined to social situations and if you are feeling well and relaxed during other times, then you most likely are having ""social anxiety"". having some amount of anxiety is normal, but it becomes abnormal if... it is either excessive or if it affects your normal functioning... so, if you feel that your anxiety is present too often or too much or is interfering with your functioning or performance, then you may be having an anxiety disorder, and you need help. therapy for anxiety disorders is usually of two types: 1) medication and 2) psychological therapies like behavior therapies, talking therapies, etc. this choice would be based on the severity of your symptoms, the availability of a good therapist and of course, your personal choice as well. often, relaxation techniques such as breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, yoga, etc. can help a lot in reducing anxiety symptoms. you also mentioned that you have mild trembling even when you are not nervous. some people can have a mild basal tremor which is called an ""essential tremor"", which is generally harmless and does not need any intervention unless it is disabling. i would suggest that you consult a psychiatrist locally, so that he / she would be able to assess you in detail to find out what type and how severe your anxiety is and whether you need any medication or any other therapy for the same. please feel free to clarify any doubts that you have... wish you all the best."

"i , by name is shastra , 30 years old . trying to conceive , my doctor asked me to do follicular study , last month dominant follicle grew unto 20mm in size and ruptured on day15 but this month follicle did not grow beyond 14mm , that could be the reason for this . by doctor told it normally happens like this in 1 or 2 cycles in a year and not to worry . please advise if this is right . thank you .",1,13108,"hi, i appreciate your query would clarify the report of your follicular study to you. on the 9th day, in the right and left ovaries (of and lof) - there was no df - which means, dominant follicle. again the same findings persisted till the 13th day, that is there was no dominant follicle in any of the ovaries. et - refers to endometrial thickness which was 8 mm on day 13. collection in pod was nil, which is normal. now, to explain a normal follicular study to you. by day 9, the ovaries start producing dominant follicles, that is among the many eggs present in the ovaries, one starts maturing to develop into the dominant egg for that month. by day 13 generally, if you have a regular 28-day menstrual cycle, the dominant egg reaches a size of 20 - 22 mm. generally on day 14, ovulation occurs, that is the mature dominant egg is released from the ovary, and it is then ready for fertilization by the sperm. this is the normal studyhowever, in your case, there is no dominant follicle seen till day 13, which means that you are having an ovulatory cycle. that is, no mature egg is developing for ovulation this month. anovulatory cycles are a major cause for not being able to conceive.pod (polycystic ovarian disease) is one of the leading causes of an ovulation, apart from other conditions. you need to consult a gynecologist, and undergo further investigations for pod to rule out the cause of this follicular study. also, you might require treatment and ovulation induction (medicines to stimulate formation of follicles in the ovary). in case your cycles are delayed (longer than 28 - 30 days), there is a minor possibility that your follicles are maturing later than normal, for e.g., in a 35-day cycle, the day of ovulation would be 14 days before periods, that is on day 20 or 21. hope this helped you."

a have beeton systolic 2.5 my fro about 8 mos . a am an athlete and have noticed sudden leg weakness and shaking of legs ( rhythmic ) just before sleep and while sleeping . the exercising a do is cycling and resistance training both use lot of leg strength and endurance . is the weakness and shaking related . it has been going on fro 6 weeks . mostly at night when a lay down and the shaking begins just as a fall asleep and while sleeping,1,41571,"hello, unfortunately for physicians ""shaking"" is a very vague term, and it could mean many kinds of movements, ranging from tremulousness of the body, to flailing, to arrhythmic shaking to rhythmic shaking and all have very different implications. however, i will give you the most common cause of what you saw. most likely what occurred is called ""convulsive syncope"" which means that when you pass out you have some jerking movements, but it is not considered a seizure. what happens is that blood flow is disrupted to the brain and the person loses consciousness. because the nerve cells are suddenly deprived of oxygen, they fire abnormally for a few times causing body jerking, but when the person collapses blood flow is restored and the movements stop. so essentially the movements are caused by passing out and not by a seizure. likely what happened also was what we call a ""vasovagal reaction"" in which due to stress, emotional response among other things, the blood vessels dilate and blood rushed down from the head into the legs causing a person to pass out. the classic example of this is when a person who is getting their blood chat doctor. it is not considered abnormal, and can happen to anybody. lastly, just to describe what a true seizure looks like. typically, what happens is that a person will first stiffen up, the eyes will turn up into the head with the eyes remaining open. there is often a very loud scream due to the abdominal muscles tensing up and expelling air from the lungs. the stiffening phase is then followed by a rhythmic, whole body shaking. when i say rhythmic i mean that the jerks occur at regular intervals and at the same time in all extremities of the body. the gradually slow down and the person becomes limp and often is breathing very hard. when they wake up there is almost always confusion that lasts several minutes and then slowly the person returns to their normal state of mind. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"when i eat egg noodle my stomach starts feeling really bad and i want to barf . my mouth gets watery and i get goosebumps . but when i eat eggs its fine , so i done think its the egg . also when i eat deep fried food i also get the same problem . how can i fix this",1,94135,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. many women get pain in their chest from reflux or gastritis. when your stomach starts to secrete acid, like when you eat, the pain may get worse. acid reflux literally means that the acid from your stomach sloshes up into your esophagus, and that can cause it to spasm, which you are feeling when you lie down. taking your german at the full adult dose (150 mg) daily will gradually help the symptoms, but i also suggest you purchase a calcium-containing antacid (like tums) and take two whenever you feel the spasms or pain in your shoulder. trying to only eat upright and staying upright at least 2 hours after eating will help to reduce the reflux as well. if you always feel the pain when you lie down, try to prop yourself up on pillows, so your head is higher than the rest of your body. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

(would you be having it then?) now your cycle is of 30 days period. so the expected date of ovulation should be 07 january. hence, if the conception takes place on 07 january, the due date of delivery would be 30 september. the hitch here is that you should have ovulation taking lace on 07 january. moreover, we have noticed that all the pregnancies do not last for 280 days. the delivery can take place any time between 3 weeks earlier to 1 week later than the expected due date of delivery. keeping these facts and calculations in mind, you may plan your sexual relations accordingly. i hope this will help you."

i a a having really bad abdominal pain ( especially in my left side ) very light almost spotting earlier today it was a bright pinkish colour little mucus as well ... a have been nassau for about a week and over the weekend i had a cramping feeling in my left side but different from mistral cramps ... by period was supposed to come yesterday ...,1,8772,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the proper way to use the nearing is to put it in, leave it in for 3 weeks, take it out, wait one week, and replace it. during the week you are not wearing the ring, you should have some bleeding that is considered a menstrual cycle. if you wore the ring continuously for two months and then had a new one replaced but only removed it 3 days later, the pinkish spotting was your ""period"", which is caused by not wearing the ring. the bleeding was very light because you had suppressed it by continuously wearing the ring for over 2 months. so you should expect your next period about 4-5 weeks after the episode of spotting that you had. if you do not have menses by then, i recommend repeating the pregnancy test at that time. if you did not have regular monthly cycles before you used the ring, your cycle will follow your regular pattern that you typically have when not using hormonal contraception. if you are trying to get pregnant, you should have intercourse about every other day and begin taking prenatal vitamins as it benefits the health of the baby for the vitamins to be present at conception. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

hi my sister in law is 14 and 4 months pregnant . she has a hole in the heart and is currently on a waiting list for a heart transplant . she has a pacemaker . i need to know if she will carry of or if it could be fatal . she has had 4 heart attacks in the past 12 months .,1,39157,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. if your sister-in-law truly is on a heart transplant list, it means her heart function is very compromised. pregnancy increases strain on a women's heart, and pregnancy also makes blood clot more easily, which can put women at risk for stroke if they have abnormal heart motion. the fact that she needs a pacemaker is another sign that her heart cannot beat properly on its own. therefore, i hope your sister-in-law is getting care at a major medical center and can consult with a high-risk obstetrician, because pregnancy may be an extremely risky state for her. there is no danger from maternal heart disease to the baby, but the mother may have an increased risk of stroke, heart attack and even death if the pregnancy continues. so without complete review of all you sisters-in-law medical records, i cannot exactly determine what her percent risks are, but all women with severe cardiac disease while pregnant have an increased risk of death. i sincerely hope her doctors will determine the best course of action for her health, which may be to not continue the pregnancy if that is an option. i hope i was able to help answer your question and sincerely wish your sister-in-law the best of luck for her health and her pregnancy. sincerely,"

(do not put the punctured finger in your mouth). if your father-in-law is suffering from any disease which can be transmitted by blood and blood products (hematological transmission), like hepatitis b, hepatitis c and hiv, then the need for concern arises. in that case i would advise you to consult your physician. i don't think it will be a need for concern if he is suffering from urinary tract infection. however, in the future, please use a proper handcar to handle these sharp objects. hope that helps you."

wanted to discuss with someone regarding gallstone problem . by husband is 45 years old . be has been diagnosed with gallbladder stones ( multiple ) . that are the options available for a permanent solution other than surgery as there have been instances where people have undergone gallbladder operation but the problem still persists .,1,20699,"hello, juneymaason, i am not sure from your comments whether you are too young or too mature in age. however, if you have been diagnosed with multiple gallstones, it is extremely difficult to get rid of them by non-surgicalmethods. there are medications to dissolve the stone, but it does notwork for multiple stones. small single gallstone may dissolve with medication in about 3-6 months, and it can come back after the medication is stopped. the other method we have available miscalled shock wave lithography, blasting the stone with shock waves. again, this might work for a single stone but multiple stones pose problem. there are complications from this procedure, because small portions of the broken stone can block the bile passage and cause a major problem requiring surgery.nowadays, gallbladder surgery is a same day procedure done through small buttonholes on the belly with the use of laparoscope. recovery is faster. this is done even at 80+ years of age without problems. low fat diet may help to prevent some attacks, but it snot a cure. herbal medicine, olive oil and lemon juice does not help to get rid of the stones. i hope this information helps you. i wish you the very best."

of mother inlaw was a rayed and the impression written of ... adhesion where noted of both apices left costrophic sulcus isobliterated aorta of calcified .conclussion athermatous aorta residual fibrosis . effusion vs. adhesion left sulcus.i would like to know what it means in layman term thank you,2,65326,"hello thanks for posting here. transposition of great vessels or tga is a condition where the aorta arises from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle. in our body, the left ventricle supplies oxygenated blood via the aorta to the various organs of the body to provide oxygen for them to function. the right ventricle receives all this deoxygenated blood back from the organs and then pumps it into the lungs through the pulmonary artery to oxygenate the blood again which is then again directed towards the left side of the heart and the cycle continues. in tga, since the connections are interchanged, the deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle goes into the aorta and hence the organs of the body receive deoxygenated blood. this leads to symptoms like breathlessness, bluish discoloration of skin, multiorgan dysfunction etc. similarly the oxygenated blood from the lungs goes to the left ventricle and then into the pulmonary artery again into the lung. so body doesn't receive oxygenated blood. when the fetus is inside the mother, there is a connection between the aorta and pulmonary artery which closes after birth. this duct is called ducts arterioles which helps in mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood when fetus is inside the mother. in infants with tga, it is necessary to keep this ducts arterioles (da) patent so that oxy- and deoxygenated blood can mix and the infant receives some amount of oxygenated blood. so in order to keep this duct patent some medications are given till corrective surgery is done. corrective surgeries basically reconnect the connections to supply oxygenated blood to organs and deoxygenated to lungs. also know there are two forms of tga, corrected and uncorrected. corrected is when there is transposition but left ventricle despite being connected to pulmonary artery, the pulmonary artery further supplies the body organs. therefore corrected gas are normally asymptomatic and don't require surgery. uncorrected gas are symptomatic and usually require corrective surgeries. i hope this solves your queries. it is very confusing initially to understand, i have used the best possible way to explain you. thank you"
of mother inlaw was a rayed and the impression written of ... adhesion where noted of both apices left costrophic sulcus isobliterated aorta of calcified .conclussion athermatous aorta residual fibrosis . effusion vs. adhesion left sulcus.i would like to know what it means in layman term thank you,3,44855,"greetings. welcome to chat doctor, and thank you for your question. i understand your concern. your age would help me a lot in constructing a differential diagnosis. however, i will explain some forms of chest pain, which we aim to exclude first, as the main and most dangerous organic causes of it. first, there is angina. angina is a moderate-to-severe chest pain, more characterized like a heaviness or tenderness or ""squeezing"" feeling, localized in the mid-chest, and then radiates to the both sides of the chest, the jaw, left shoulder and left arm. this is the pain originated from one or more blockages within the coronary arteries (arteries that supply the heart muscle with oxygen and nutrients). if this is your case, you should perform an ekg and an echocardiogram, and, depending on these two tests, a cardiac stress test. second, there is sharp, stabbing pain. this kind of pain can come from an enlargement of the root of the aorta and/or from aortic aneurysm. it is severe in intensity, and radiates to the back, between the wings. also, it can be caused by an acute or chronic inflammation to the linings within the rib cage, i.e. the pleura (lining of the lungs) and pericardium (the lining of the heart). this kind of pain - pleuritic pain - is less severe than that caused by aortic aneurysm, and relieves or aggravates from switching positions or the respiratory cycle. if this is the case, then echocardiogram (for pericardium and root of the aorta), chest x-ray (for the pleura and the lungs), and computed tomography of the aorta (in case we suspect that there is a problem with the aorta, higher than its root), should be performed. there is always a possibility of intercostal (between ribs) muscle or pectoral (chest) muscle soreness, and pain originated from problems with ribs and rib joints. if this is the case, you can use over the counter painkillers. i hope i was thorough with my answer. best regards."
i am suffering from pain in left leg i.e . from knee to foot but it is not exactly the severe pain but continuous light pain is occurring in calf muscle and while climbing stairs it gets increases . that is it exactly and it feels like whole weight goes to the left leg and feeling pain ? that is the cure ?,1,14812,"as per your explanation i understand there are two issues. first is left leg imbalance and not able to give weight in it. second is high blood sugar. for sugar patient it is common when ever there is some things wring in body along with inflammation the first thing is sugar level goes up. but it can also be normally without any cause so first thing you need to do is maintain his diet and blood sugar level through insulin or which ever way possible. if needed to visit your planetologist for further treatment. next you have mention he is not able to balance or give weight on one of his leg. but you have not mentioned what exactly happens when he gives weight on leg. is it due to pain or loss of control. let's assume if its pain. now pain in leg can be due to some injury where he might have hit his leg some were and he don't remember, or it can be due to reduce blood circulation also. here i suggest patient need to visit an orthopedic doctor and go ahead with proper examination and evaluation and plan treatment as per that. if there is too much pain at leg then patient can use hot pack as well apply a crew bandage to stabilize the soft tissue. this will help for getting some pain relief but remember this will not cure the pain. so do visit doctor as early as possible. if its loss of control then also you need to evaluate it properly why it's happening. it may be possible due to age also. but further evaluation as well conformation can be done only on examination, so i suggest to check with doctor again for this. i am sure this will be useful for you if you follow the given advice properly. take care."

"hello , a am a fit fifty year old female and seem to bruise spontaneously . a get an intense itch and then a swelling and large bruise in a matter of minutes . yesterdays was on the outside of my foot at the base of my baby toe . just wondering what may cause this . it has happened over the last several years on a few occasions on my fingers but never on my foot .",1,13930,"hello, and thank you for your question. fortunately, you probably do not have fibromyalgia. there are several possible causes of pain just in the toe. if there is a pinched nerve in the lower spine, it can cause pain that can be just in one toe. if this is the case, you may find that the pain is worse with change in position, such as lying flat or standing up. pain in the toe, typically the big toe, is common in a disorder called gout, in which the body has too much uric acid. the pain usually lasts a few days at a time, and is usually associated with redness and swelling. pain in the toes can be caused by corns or other skin problems that look small but feel very severe. pins and needles, shooting, on-and-off pains can be caused by irritation to a nerve by diabetes, by lack of vitamins such as b12, or by pressure - similar to the ""foot falling asleep"" feeling we sometimes get if we cross our legs too long. fibromyalgia, on the other hand, is usually a ""pain all over"" problem - back pain, neck pain, arm pain, knee pain, without another cause such as arthritis. it usually does not cause just one part of the body to hurt - most patients say that ""everything hurts"". in my practice, i start with finding out as much as i can from the patient about how the pain feels and how long it has been going on, and if it seems related to anything else. then we examine the foot to look for anything going on with the skin, check if the nerves of the foot are normally sensitive, not as sensitive as usual, or more sensitive, and then we may check blood tests to detect diabetes or vitamin deficiency or other problems as needed. fibromyalgia is diagnosed by obtaining a careful history of where the patient is having pain, other medical problems, and completing a physical exam including what is called a ""painful point"" exam where the doctor pushes at certain places in the body - on the back and near the joints - to see if this causes pain. i hope that my answer to your question is helpful. if you have any further questions, please check back with us. i hope your toe is much better soon."

"a started my leven de pill for the first time but when a started a did to start in the sugar pills ( red section ) , a started in the other section pills on the day a finished my period , is this okay ? to a started in the top row of my pill packet on a thursday in the contraception pill section ? pm a doing it right ?",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"i , a have been on to loestrin birth control for a little over a year now and i be had unprotected sex with my boyfriend but it was only for a short amount of time , and he pulled out . we be recently started using condoms again but but in still worried . is there a high possibility i could get pregnant ?",1,108096,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. it is true that theoretically you should have been clear of the injection within three months of discontinuation, however many women after being a depo-provera for a long time do not resume having ovulatory, regular, menstrual cycles until 6 to 9 months or even up to a year after discontinuation. unfortunately, it is difficult to artificially induce ovulation in women who are coming off depo-provera. if you were not trying to become pregnant, your cycle could be regulated temporarily with birth control pills, but if you're actually trying to get pregnant the best thing you can do with this point is to just keep trying and wait and see. if you feel any symptoms of pregnancy, and you haven't gotten your period for a while, i would do pregnancy test just to make sure. there is always a possibility even if your periods are not regular that you do ovulate sometimes. so in summary, continue having unprotected sex every other to every three days and give it some more time. 80% of couples will conceive within one year, and if after a year of trying you and your partner are unsuccessful, it might be a good idea to see a fertility specialist for an evaluation. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes, and good luck getting pregnant,"

a couple of months ago i fell about 5 foot from a ladder landing on a concrete floor injuring my ribs in several places on my left side . for the last couple of weeks i am feeling an increasing burning feeling and twinges under the bottom of my ribs and around to my left side and am wondering if i have have now damaged anything else in the fall ? thank you for your time .,1,48791,"hi, thank you for providing the brief history of you. a thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised. as your chief complaint is that when you walk there is a sharp pain in the lateral side of the left foot, i suspect it to be muscular pain or either neuropathic pain for which a thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised. also. when there is a nerve impingement in the lumbar spine, it all starts with the pain in most cases on the lateral side of the foot. as you even mentioned that you had a bony injury in the past, there might be a tendency of abnormal gait during that time and shortening of muscles of the spine due to walking in pain. as i feel, by strengthening the muscles of the core, spine, pelvic floor and lower limbs on both sides you should be able to walk. since the nerve impingement gives the initial symptoms as pain in the lateral side of the foot and progresses over a period of time. so before it gets more on future you can get an mri of lumbar spine and them proceed with physical therapy for the lumbar spine. in my clinical experience i see cases who initially comes with this sort of pain and later with nerve impingement diagnosis. so, from past couple of years i have noticed that this is the first alerting symptom of the neurological pain, so now i deal with first an mri of spine and core stability. results come on 3-4 weeks of time and post which in future complaints are less regards jay in chat doctor."

"hello , my 2 year old son .. 11 kilos has are anaemia and just getting off a cold , has been taking antibiotics for 5 days , as long with congestion medicine , tempera for fever ( which he didst have to take anymore ) and iron supplements .. but the past 2 days he has had a high fever and has been in the fetal position as if he has stomach cramps or has been trying to poop and cant .. this only happens at night , in the morning he is active with high energy .. it daycare they say he poops and eats fine so i am not sure what the problem is .",1,90927,"hi, i am chat doctor. i have read your message. i think i can help you. first, the symptoms that you have described are highly suggestive of seizures. here is why- 1. they come in night-seizures are commonly triggered when the patient sleeps or just around the sleep. of course, they can occur at other times too.2. they start from the leg and move up and then spread to the rest of the body.3. the episodes last 3-4 minutes and then resolves. i assume (you have not mentioned it) that it is never remembered by him, the episode that is. i think you should both take it very seriously. there is a high possibility that there is an intracranial problem that he is having which is extending and progressing undetected in the brain just because you do not want to visit a neurologist. i think you should meet a neurologist as soon as possible and request an mri brain (with spectroscopy if needed) and video eeg. if he does turn out to have a pathology, treatment will have to be initiated for the pathology in addition to regular anti-epileptic medicines. i suggest taking a video of these episodes that he is having. it may help convince him that he needs to visit a doctor, and it may be helpful to the doctor in seeing the condition that your husband has. yes, you need to visit a neurologist as soon as possible. ideally, i would also like to know if he has been having headaches for the past years? does he seem to be having episodes where he does not recollect what he has been doing for a certain duration of time? you may need to talk to his colleagues at work and find out if he has been having seizures or any abnormal behavior at work. there is a high chance that he knows that he has been having seizures at work and not telling you about it. i have tried my best to help you. unfortunately, i cannot initiate / suggest medicines as long as the diagnosis is not confirmed because the anti-epileptics may have severe side effects. best of luck,"

"hello doctors , a am 27 yrs old , me and my husband have been trying to conceive for the past 5 yrs but still failed till now . a have tried some treatments such as closed , serene and lately luteal but its still not happening . be took 4 months break from trying and this month we decided to start it all over again . to all my tests proved to be okay . an you please help ? thank you . tina",1,52747,"hello, and i hope i can clarify this for you. you are absolutely correct in the fact that the length of your cycle is related to when you ovulate... and your ovulation date is 14 days back from when you got your period, rather than counting 14 days from the start of your period. it is typical for most women to have a 14-day luteal phase, as you suggested. you absolutely may ovulate later in your cycle. i do not know how long you and your partner have tried to conceive before trying closed. i would not recommend trying closed at all unless you have tried for a year (meaning unprotected sex at least 2-3 times per week) and not become pregnant. a reproductive endocrinologist is an appropriate referral if you have a history of infertility for one year, and if you fail at least 3 cycles of closed. they can prescribe closed and combine it with intrauterine insemination, which can increase the success rate. even though you may have had a child together before, there can be an issue with the male partner too, and it would be advisable he gets his sperm count evaluated. but you can still have conceived this cycle if you ovulated on the closed, and continued to have unprotected sex at least a week after your ovulation kit showed positive. your progesterone level pre-ovulation is not relevant at all. so- if you don't get a period by day 35 or so, do a pregnancy test. and if you didn't conceive this cycle, a reproductive endocrinologist might be a better choice to manage your closed. i hope this answered your question, and best of luck in getting pregnant. take care,"

"i , my daughter is 4 years of age and has been treated for scalp ringworm5-6 times . to one else in the family has gotten a ringworm and a done think she has gotten it from anyone at school because she has since changed schools and yet they persist . a am a nurse , so a make sure she takes her full regimen of griseofulvin as prescribed , but yet the ringworm returns . this last time she went approximately 1.5 years without the ringworm because the doctor suggested taking the med twice a day to keep the levels in her system steady and give with whole milk , since we drink soy in the family . and this worked , and i thought it was gone forever , until this week when a noticed a new lesion in her scalp . an she possibly have a genetic predisposition . why does she keep getting this scalp ringworm ? pm starting to wonder if she has a problem with her immune system .",1,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"hello doctor , a am 23 years old . a am in great physical shape , but my diet could be better . a have occasional high blood pressure , but my eyes are always vasocontricted . lately , the left side of my brain has been giving me some weird tingling feeling . during these times , i find it hard to concentrate . pm worried i may be experiencing small stroke . by egg is normal . pm just freaking out cause a don to know what it is",1,104553,"hi, as you mentioned the symptoms it looks like the patient had an early stroke. during the brain stroke every single minute is important. stroke can be assessed by experiencing the slurred speech, slowing of motor functions, unable to respond to commands. the first thing need is to get admit to a nearby hospital with a ct or an mri facility. if the brain stroke is on the left side on the ct or mri scan than the symptoms will be on the opposite side due to the pyramidal tracts of the nervous system. the design of the human body and its control system by nature is made such that left side of the brain support the right side of the body. once stroke comes rushing into and emergency room is always advised. within 3 hours of the first symptom noticed is of priority and importance. any delay in every minute will damage the brain more. as the blood supply to the brain is restricted by the clot and the damage to the neural tissues keeps continuing. so as soon as one notices the symptoms the earliest you should reach to the emergency room and start the treatment. well, what could have lead to stroke will be the high blood pressure findings are in common. ecg can be normal can be abnormal. ecg is done to rule out certain factors and focus the whole treatment plan on the brain stroke. that is the reason the ecg is always taken. brain stoke can be confined by symptoms and later my mri or a ct scan. post stroke if the physical disability is found then a physical therapist is taken into consideration along with the medication prescribed by the neurologist and the cardiologist. if patient has diabetes than a planetologist should be contacted for the medical part. i hope i have answered your query. if any you have in particular to ask or didn't understand i will surely help you in it."

a have a hard bump on my head the size of half a small marble . it is hard but the bump comes and goes . by leg all down my tibia used to have similar bumps down it but all of them went away except one that has been there for months . a went to the doctor and they did rays and said it is soft tissue and if it does to go away to got a general surgeon he said to stop taking my birth control to see if it goes away . by the time a saw the surgeon most of the bumps had gotten a lot smaller and he said why worry about it because it seems to be going down . a now don to know what to do because the bump on my forehead is not going away . a was thinking ( with no medical background ) that it was possibly a calcium deposit,1,6473,"it is never wrong to have a doctor look! statistics show that if a child hits her head but never loses consciousness, never throws up, cries right away or returns to play right away, and doesn't seem sleepy or unusually out of it after a head bump, then the chances of a serious injury being present are extremely low. most likely the nose/mouth got hit somehow on the way down or right when she hit, and that lead to the bleed. if it stopped right away, it is usually no cause for alarm. again, if anything at all seems off, it is always right to have the doctor take a look."

"i doc , good afternoon . a am from the this , 28 and almost 2yrs married . here trying to get pregnant but nothing happens . eve done our check-up and take some its and medicines . by menstruation is irregular and a have polycyclic . by husband also have problem of fertility and have varicose on her left scrotum . all give us some advise for us to have a baby of our own . make care and god bless us all .",1,3079,"hi, i guess your concern is about getting pregnant, naturally without ivf, at the age of 42 years. you have mentioned that you are taking medicine - m2 tone for regularization of menses. the dose and since when you have started taking the medicine is not shared by you. after taking the medicines whether the menses have become regular or not, it is also not shared by you. it is natures rule, as we get older the functions of our body will be decreased quantitatively and qualitatively. the ovaries also decrease in its function as women become old. the reproductive age group, that is maximum chances of conceiving is more usually at 20 to 40 years. around the age of 50 to 52 years, women stop her menses. this indicates she can't conceive anymore. the age 45-48 years is a transition zone from highly reproductive age group to the age group where menses stop. and here the chances of getting pregnant are not as high as reproductive age group and not low as 50- 52 yrs of age. but still there are a chances of getting pregnant in this transition age, and you are at 42, so there is a hope of getting pregnant. be positive and don't lose hope. however, irregular menses at this age decreases the chances of pregnancy. but, as you are on medicine for irregular menses, once the menses becomes regular, the chances of getting pregnancy increases. so there is double positive hope for you. some people thought they are in reproductive age group, because of problem, either in husband and wife, chances of getting pregnancy decreases. you have told that my and my husband reports are fine. so there is triple positive hope. as you have lost your first child, and you are at the transition zone, it's better to go for an accelerated method of pregnancy. the accelerated methods are-ivf, gift, gift, csi. the advantage of accelerated methods is getting twins of triplets is also there. my suggestions:1. have patience. wait till the menses becomes regular. then pray to god for natural method of getting pregnant.2. at the age of 42, transition zone i would recommend u for accelerated methods - assisted reproductive techniques (art) - ivf, gift, gift, csi and to visit nearby infertility specialist to know pros n cons of each. i pray god to give strength to your family about the loss of first child and bless you with a cute and healthy baby as soon as possible. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"before 2 years i have miscarriage 3 month , then my or are not recommend a a c.last 1 year i want to conceive by a fail to get pregnant.my or says i he pcs problem i use if treatment and other more by a not pregnant.now ply tel me what i can do a very disappointed , ply help me .... ply sara",1,76346,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. fertomid is a type of fertility medication used help to cause ovulation in women who have trouble getting pregnant. because you did get pregnant (even though you had a miscarriage), unless you have been trying since then for over a year and been unable to conceive, the fatimid medication will not likely increase your chance of pregnancy significantly. therefore, even if you forgot to take some pills, you still have a significant chance of pregnancy as you are still very young, especially if you have regular menstrual cycles. if you and your husband have not been trying to conceive for more than a year on your own, i would not recommend using any fertility medication. using fatimid for more than four menstrual cycles can actually reduce your risk of pregnancy, as it decreases the effect of estrogen on your uterine lining. 80% of healthy couples will conceive within one year if they are having regular (at least 2 to 3 days per week) intercourse without contraception. one in 10 pregnancies will end in miscarriage, which means that 90% of the time couples will conceive a perfectly healthy pregnancy after a miscarriage without any form of medical treatment. so in summary, missing the fatimid tablets this particular month will not likely affect your chance of conceiving this cycle if you already ovulate naturally. i strongly recommend trying to get pregnant naturally for one year before using any type of fertility medication, as your body has proven that you can conceive even though that pregnancy did not work out. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this additional information was helpful. best wishes,"

a was sleeping in a day and suddenly when a got up a start to feel vomiting as vomiting have not come out.i felt the vomiting.im not pregnant a checked it and first time a felt after sudden wake up.then a forced myself to sleep after a went back to sleep and again got up it was ok.may a know why it happened.im 31 yrs old female with no diabetes and blood pressure.and also when a try to sleep a start to cough which is dry and also feel short of breath.pls let me know the replies of both thanks arena,1,19614,"dear concerned., thanks for writing to us. basically to maintain the biorhythm an individual needs to sleep for 06to 08 hours a day. otherwise, there will be definitely increase in blood pressure. the initial symptom of cold sweat and dizziness could have been a result of sudden variation in bp as a result of lack of sleep. this is physiological or normal phenomenon. you have not mentioned regarding whether you have passed urine when you went to restroom. sudden evacuation of bladder in such a situation will lead to gushing of blood to the urinary bladder musculature depriving the brain from its blood supply for seconds as the urine passes out and the bladder musculature normal in thickness(in its maximum capacity the bladder would balloon out to store urine up to 750 ml almost obliterating its own blood supply if you withhold passing urine). the sudden crazy unable to stand, and you had to sit up was due to a condition called micturition syncope. it is almost always physiological or normal phenomenon. now you may ask why the condition improved after you have thrown up the gastric contents. you have relieved the gastrointestinal system from the work load and the blood supply was restored to the nervous system. again physiological and it was untimely food in all probability. i am giving you only the probability as i have only read the history and not examined you physically. in both cases i.e., the root cause seems to be due to sudden change in your biorhythm/lack of sleep. it does not seem to be due to quality of food or water per se but due to irregular sleep/eating pattern. kindly help yourself with normal sleep. in the event of non improvement kindly consult a locally available general physician for a complete evaluation. get well soon. best regards., chat doctor."

i have a tooth that broke in half a year ago and then i slacked and didst get it fixed it hurt in controllable for 2 weeks i have no medical insurance and today i woke up and my face a jaw and mouth around the tooth is swollen . in a laid off est so i have needles and such in my bag and was wondering if i should drain the puss out . and there are no lumps so its not accessed,1,44715,"hello, i can understand your concern. it would have been helpful if you had mentioned which tooth was treated for root canal. as you are mentioning that the tooth was black and had cracks in it, i am assuming that the tooth is in the lower front region, and you had had some trauma to the lower jaw area which made the tooth dead and also hurt the chin and lip. other possibility is that if the tooth was dead for many years, it may have developed a periapical cyst in relation with the tooth which might be pressing on the mental nerve supplying lower lip and chin and may cause numbness of those areas. alternatively, the numbness may have started after taking local anesthesia in the lower front area for some tooth problem and the injection might have been given deep. in any case, it seems that the nerve supplying sensation to the lower front area of jaw along with lower lip and chin (mental nerve) is damaged. usually, if the nerve is damaged, it can regenerate in 3-6 months and the sensations can return. if you are not sure regarding the crown on the tooth, you can avoid it for some months and take care not to bite hard things with that tooth so that it does not fracture. you can get the crown after the numbness is solved. i would also advise you to visit an oral and maxillofacial surgeon for the examination of the area and regarding numbness. he/she might take an x-ray to rule out presence of periapical lesion or cyst in relation with the tooth. crown should surely be postponed until this possibility is ruled out. i hope this information helps you. thank you for choosing chat doctor. i wish you feel better soon. best,"

"hi , in 17 and i came of the pill a month a go . when i first came off there was spot bleeding and everything was fine . but now in getting really think discharge like 6-7 times a day . i checked on the nos symptom checker and it says i could be pregnant , do you know what it is ?",2,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"that is the best approach to the following . while sedated yesterday a was asked to give permission that a new dental bridge for several of my front teeth looked good and a was pleased with it . a was helped by two people and asked to look at this mirror about 3 feet away . a could not even make out my mouth everything was fuzzy . just wanted to sit down . a said a guess so . it was permanently glued in and now that a am awake , the bridge is plain awful , ugly and to big for my mouth . the front teeth slant to the right , teeth are to big and it looks just terrible . most $ 7200.00 and a am unhappy . initial conversation with office tells me that a okayed the placement . a asked if they always asked patients that are sedated to give consent . to far a am stuck with this nasty bridge . that do a do ?",1,84226,"hi. welcome to chat doctor . i have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. as per your complaint as the bridge has broken and if there is no pain associated with the teeth over which the bridge was cemented then redoing of root canal treatment in all the teeth seems a bit questionable and i would like to see the x-ray of the region for guiding you better as then only i can rule out that whether there is need of repeating the root canal treatment or not. you can also take an advice from an endodontist who can take an x-ray and advise you what to be done. after the confirmation only that whether the teeth need root canal treatment done again or not, the bridge can be replaced. for the front 6 teeth which seems to have removable dentures a permanent bridge can be placed only in case if the remaining teeth over which the bridge will be cemented are in sound condition or not as they are having sound bone support or not so that they can bear the forces and this can also be confirmed by a clinical evaluation and an x-ray of the teeth that has to be prepared for cementing the bridge. a properly fabricated bridge which is cemented on sound teeth which has a good bone support will have a long life and will not cause any problems after placement. if you wish to get a proper advise before you proceed with the treatment you can send the concerned x-rays to me directly by going to my profile and writing your question there with concerned x-rays so that i can advise you correctly so that you can get treated properly. hope this information helps. if you find the answer helpful please give me a five-star review and click on found the answer helpful as a token of appreciation. thanks and regards. chat doctor. ."

an you get pregnant by fingering ? of you are holding onto a males penis through his boxers and he pre-ejaculates is there any real contact with his pre-ejaculation and the hand considering clothing was in the way ? also could one get pregnancy if she fingered herself afterwards ?,1,4915,"hi, thanks for writing in. it is unlikely that a pregnancy will occur if the man ejaculates in his boxers and the woman is wearing her inner clothes. pregnancy requires sperm to be deposited at the vaginal opening and during the above event it was not possible for the semen to get deposited because both of you were wearing clothes.therefore, in such an even where there is clothing to clothing contact then pregnancy cannot occur. the sperm will not travel through your boxers and then her inner clothes to reach the vagina and cause pregnancy. please do not worry."
an you get pregnant by fingering ? of you are holding onto a males penis through his boxers and he pre-ejaculates is there any real contact with his pre-ejaculation and the hand considering clothing was in the way ? also could one get pregnancy if she fingered herself afterwards ?,2,37527,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. even though your boyfriends penis was inside you for only a short time, sperm can be present in pre-ejaculate (or pre-cum) and if you truly do not want to become pregnant it is really important to avoid any contact of the penis with your vagina during sexual play. the most fertile time of a woman cycle is in the middle, typically 14 days before your menstrual period would be due. so the time from when your period finishes until you start to feel pms symptoms is your fertile time. so in this case, since your boyfriend did not ejaculate, it still would be quite rare for you to have conceived. the most common sign of pregnancy is a late or delayed menstrual period. so in your case, you just need to wait for your period to arrive, and if it is late, you can do an over-the-counter urine pregnancy test which is greater than 99% accurate. pregnancy test do not become positive however until at least 2 to 3 weeks after conception. so in summary, your chances of having gotten pregnant in your particular situation is very, very low. for the future, please make sure that the penis is completely covered with a condom if it has any contact with the opening of your vagina. as long as the area is moist, sperm can swim all the way up your vagina from the opening and result in pregnancy. however, the amount of sperm in pre-cum is extremely low, so again i doubt that you need to be concerned about this one sexual encounter. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was helpful. best wishes,"

"by grandson is 6 years old and has been having a cod for a couple of weeks with a little fever well the cold a subsided and the fever but he still have a little sniffing and coughing , now he has little white bulbs on his tongue what could have cause his",1,44716,"hello vivek, thank you for posting your question. the clinical diagnosis of any fever is based on a few principles. firmly we inquire about the associated symptoms the child had with fever. apart from that the extent and pattern of fever, whether it was associated with chills or came at any particular time of the day etc. these details would help us know what would probably have caused the fever and based on that investigations are usually ordered. in case of atv, as you informed he was initially treated for a stomach infection, then for pneumonia and finally for urinary tract infection. in such a situation you have two possibilities. either he had 3 different kinds of infection which presented with fever over 2 months, in which case his fever should have subsided each time with the medication, he should have felt better and then again fallen sick with a new infection. if that is not the case then his fever could probably be attributed to a single cause, with the other two being misdiagnoses. in such cases investigations could give support and clue as to what the exact cause of fever is. mucosal irregularities in urinary bladder is a very non-specific finding and the diagnosis of a urinary tract infection should never solely be based on that. associated symptoms of pain or difficulty in urination along with a positive urine culture is required for diagnosis. if you could provide any more information regarding what his urine culture report was, or what his associated symptoms were, then it would be much easier for me to provide you any further guidance."

"a think a may be miscarrying but a did to know a was pregnant . a was having sex with my boyfriend regularly and using microgynon birth control . a attended hospital for a are of assessment as a am having knee surgery and the nurses told me that a had to stop using the pill that day for the operation to go ahead . to a stopped it about 28 days ago , the day after having sex and my period came about 3 days ago . by period normally lasts 3 days max and is very light , passes with no pain , only an increase in appetite but for the last 3 days a have been experiencing excruciating cramp and a have been very tired . a normally pass one or two little clots of dark blood but today and yesterday a have passed no less than 15 very large clots . the period blood a normally have is red but slightly gunge like and sticky , this time the blood looks exactly like if you were to bleed after cutting your arm ( just normal blood ) . that should a do ?",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"for two days a have had trouble getting a deep breath . the more a move around and do , the harder it is to get that good breath.i also have a feeling of fullness . a can only eat a tiny bit because a feel so full . pm not in any pain , just very uncomfortable . that could cause these feelings ?",1,15046,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. feeling short of breath is not unusual while you're pregnant because the hormones of pregnancy actually have a way of telling your brain to breathe faster. this is to ensure that your baby gets enough oxygen, because as your belly gets bigger your lungs are not able to expand as well. so many women feel the sensation of needing to catch their breath all the time when they breathe when they are in the third trimester. in addition, because you would have been on bed rest for so long, you probably are not in very good cardiovascular shape. another possible reason why you could be feeling short of breath is that there is a possibility that you are anemic. normally, as part of routine prenatal care we check your blood count as well is a test for gestational diabetes somewhere between 24 and 28 weeks. if you've not yet had this test, it might be a good idea to mention your symptoms to your doctor. of course, there can be some serious, dangerous things that can cause shortness of breath; like blood clots that spread to your lung, or fluid in the lungs and other pulmonary problems. if you experience any chest pain or severe shortness of breath or start developing a productive cough, you should notify your doctor immediately and possibly go to the hospital for evaluation. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"
"for two days a have had trouble getting a deep breath . the more a move around and do , the harder it is to get that good breath.i also have a feeling of fullness . a can only eat a tiny bit because a feel so full . pm not in any pain , just very uncomfortable . that could cause these feelings ?",2,97433,"hi, after reviewing your question i assume you mean a positive breath test for h. pylori? i am sorry to hear the amount of discomfort that you've been through. this is how i would proceed to look at your case:1. your symptoms are very peculiar for peptic ulcer disease or gastritis. both are different ways of getting damage done to your stomach. an ulcer is like a crater which may or may not be prone to bleeding. gastritis is a bit like having multiple pinpoint sore spots, causing pain and discomfort. a positive breath test may mean that you have h. pylori infection. as uncomfortable as this is, it is usually very treatable. were you on many painkillers because of the spinal fusion? if yes, then they would certainly have contributed. 2. i don't think a mask has anything to do with this. a sterile nasogastric tube taken out of the bag is very unlikely to bring infection to the insides of the stomach. nasogastric tubes, however, do cause a bit of irritation in the stomach lining. while they could have a very small contribution, i doubt they have had a significant effect. 3. the problem at hand seems to be the h. pylori infection which is a bacterial infection of the stomach lining which causes wear and tear in the stomach. this bug is acquired by the orofacial route. what this means is that someone with h. pylori sheds the bacteria through their stools. sometimes, because of poor hand hygiene, they may pass it on to others, especially through food. the new victim ingests these bugs and in this way h. pylori finds a new home to infest. i don't think your husband having a breath test will add to anything if he does not have symptoms. 4. an unintentional weight loss may signify a gastric ulcer (in opposition to peptic ulcer)5. you may benefit from a look down into the stomach through gastrostomy. it will give a great deal of information. your weight loss is also an indication of getting you a ct scan of the abdomen to ensure that there is nothing dangerous in play. 6. treatment would include amoxicillin, azithromycin and an acid tablet such as omeprazole for a 10 to 14-day course. since these recommendations include a gastrostomy, you will eventually have to visit a physician or a gastroenterologist to have it done. gastroenterologists are also excellent at managing h. pylori infections, along with ulcers and gastritis."

"hi , i had my first molar ( upper-right side ) extracted friday morning . a have been using mouthwash ( scope and cepacol ) following the first 24hrs , diluted to start and now straight from the bottle . by of told me to stop cause it could still dry out the clot ! ! a hate the taste of the saline water and have been using the mouthwash after every rinse . should i stop ? thanks",1,22667,"dear patient, i can understand your concern and feel sorry for the pain you are suffering from. you are informing me that when you got the upper molar extracted, the dentist told you that the bone between the sinus and tooth is destroyed and sinus cavity is open. roots of upper molar often are found inside the maxillary sinus, which causes opening of the sinus cavity while extraction of the tooth, creating an oro-antral fistula, that is a direct connection between oral cavity and sinus cavity. in this case, the food or water you take has chances of passing infection in the sinus through mouth and the infection does not resolve. it is mandatory to close this connection between mouth and the sinus. it could be done by the dentist by taking stitches in the area when he found that sinus has opened, but it can also be done now. however, as about 2 weeks has passed since extraction, the opening would not be as much clear as it would have been during extraction. a blood clot may have filled the area. so what you need to do now is, go to an oral surgeon or an ent specialist. i know you have insurance problem, but there seems no other solution to your problem. you might have to go for x-rays and probably ct scan of the area to diagnose if oro-antral fistula actually exists and if it does, you might have to go for a little surgery to close the communication between mouth and sinus followed by antibiotics to resolve the infection. i hope this information helps. thank you for choosing chat doctor. i wish you get well soon. best,"

"i a had the arena coil fitted may 2010 ( due to heavy constant bleeding ) , a was told it would last approximately 4 years . a have had it in now for approx 2 years and 9 months and over the last few months a have felt really low , lacking energy and constant symptoms of starting a period . today i started bleeding . a know there are no guarantees the coil would last the full four years but a did not think it would wear off so soon . is this something a should go to see my of about or is it normal . all help really appreciated with this",1,10535,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. pregnacare conception is simply a combination of vitamins that help a woman have a healthy pregnancy from conception. it has no hormonal effects and should not have any impact on the regularity of your cycle nor your ability to conceive, it is not unusual for women to bleed on and off for even 6 weeks after a miscarriage so the 19-day bleeding episode you had may not have actually been a menstrual period but still could have been bleeding leftover for your d and c. so you may not be ""late"" at all, but may just have not had a real period since the pregnancy. there is no reason to assume you would have problems getting pregnant again since you have conceived naturally twice in the last year. either way, the pregnancies conception vitamins have nothing to do with your irregular bleeding. it is generally advisable to wait to try to conceive again after your first real period-so i would wait until you bleed again to resume trying to conceive. if you do not get a real period by 3 months from your last bleeding episode, you should follow up for your gun for a re-evaluation of your hormones and treatment with progesterone, which can restart your period cycling. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful. best wishes,"

"a a 14 weeks pregnant , and at 3 am , for the past 3 nights a be been bleeding . the first night was the worst , but the 2nd night was less and , at 3am this morning it was not enough to get onto underwear . a be been to the of and they listened to the heartbeat and the baby sounds fine . by cervix int open , so a did not have a miscarriage . why would i be bleeding at the same time for 3 nights in a row ?",1,16737,"hallow dear, brown vaginal bleeding is old bleeding which remains inside for few days and then comes out. when it is of substantial amount, we suspect risk to the life of the baby. however, the bleeding was trivial and after such bleeding, you have been examined in the hospital and sent home with assurance. so no need to worry about the baby. it is likely that the mouth of the uterus (cervix) has started preparing for the delivery by getting gradually merged into the uterine walls. this process known as effacement of the cervix causes dislodgement of the mucous plug in the cervical canal with some bleeding. when such blood stained mucous come out immediately, it is red, however if it remains inside the vagina (due to very little amount or position) or cervix, the blood and thus the discharge becomes brown. however, 36 weeks is too early for starting labor process. so i would advise you to have complete rest in the house in a view to postpone the starting of labor pains as far as possible, at least for one week more. it would be good practice to monitor the well-being of the baby by listening to heart sounds (if you can do that) and/or counting the movements of the baby by clock. in left side position lying, in two hours, 10 movements are perceivable. if you note fetal movements getting affected, please report to the obstetrician asap. i hope this helps you."

"i a am a 21 year old male and just this morning a have noticed a wet spot in my right nipple area as if something has been squirting there . when a checked on the internet it is known as male nipple discharge , in hearing it is normal but there is also a possibility of cancer which i refuse to believe , a need to know what it is though , it is clear liquid coming out of my right nipple spontaneously , it happened while i slept .",1,24260,"hi, i guess your concern is about reasons for not getting pregnant, right. firstly i want to tell you that there many reasons or factors which are responsible for not getting pregnancy. these factors can be present in wife or in husband or in both. in most few cases reasons are unknown.in case of female most common reason is ovarian factors like-irregular menses, cystic ovaries etc. tubal factors like blockage of one or both fallopian tubes, uterine factors like fibroid etc. sometimes there is a hormonal cause like abnormal thyroid hormones, excessive secretion of prolactin hormone etc. in case of male most common factor is abnormality in sperm or sperm production etc. secondly let us discuss your problem:- as you told that i missed your period for 2 months, but pregnancy test was negative, and you are having pain, white spot around nipple and on squeezing there is discharge from nipple, right.these problems mostly occurs in case of high prolactin level in the body. it is milk producing hormone which is secreted from pituitary gland. when its level is high in body, it causes irregular menses and milky discharge from the nipple etc. but you have not given information regarding your menses whether it is regular earlier or irregular from the starting, and also you have not told about the character of the nipple discharge. so it is difficult for me to comment on this. with above discussion you can try out my suggestions-1. as you told that you are taking birth control pills. these pills are given for regularization of menses. once your menses will regular, there is high chances of getting pregnant. so don't worry.2. try to do coitus in fertile period (it starts from 10th-16th day of menses) during this period chances of getting pregnant is high). so do coitus as much than possible.3. if you are in hurry then visit nearby infertility specialist. he/ she can help you. i hope the above information is useful, informative and helpful. let me know if i can assist you further."

i i am 20 years old and in the past couple of days i have noticed an area on the side of my tongue that i thought to be splitting open but i went to the doctor and he didst have any idea what it was . he said that is nothing to worry about and is a growth . should i be worried ?,3,58987,"his am chat doctor. i have read your message. i think i can help you. first, a package test means that multiple tests are included that correlate to the test. cpk and spe can both be package tests as there are many related tests needed in a diagnosis. the symptoms that you seem to be facing as per the query is basically severe backache that increases on lying down or bending-in other words, anything that causes the spine to be under pressure. now she itself can cause the symptoms. the muscles and bone problems can arise in she itself and thus possibly one will feel that there is nothing more to do. however, in many situations, the doctors may get biased my a diagnosis. so, i think it is good that your doctor did not get biased with your pre-existing diagnosis of she and continued to look for other causes of backache. a severe backache can happen due to muscle disorders, a condition known as myopathy. the cause of myopathy may be she itself. the test commonly done to test myopathy is cpk or creatine phospholipase. this is a test done from blood. the idea is if the cpk is raised, it suggests myopathy. in this situation, your doctor will need to modify the therapy. i am unaware of your medication from the query. so i cannot really comment upon it. but some medicines themselves cause myopathy. and sometimes, the dose of existing medicines need to be stepped up for treatment of myopathy. so i presume your doctor wanted to check that. second test was spe or serum protein electrophoresis. this is one of the tests for multiple myeloma. this is a type of malignancy that affects the bones and causes bone pains and should be ruled out in middle-aged to elderly commonly if the backache is worsening and is specially bad when lying down. if the test is negative, there is nothing to worry about. if it does come out to be positive, multiple myeloma can be treated. so again you need not worry since the treatment is available. why the doctor did not tell you about the tests is something i can only speculate about. i guess it was because these are just doubts, considering you already have she- in medicine, the usual dictum is that one disease can explain the symptom, the other condition should not be sought. having said that, it's a folly to miss another diagnosis due to a pre-existing condition. i think he would have told you if the tests came out positive. so there should be nothing to worry about-the doctor was just making sure that there is no other problem. possibly since there was nothing else diagnosed, he did not tell you about it. i have tried to make it as simple as possible to understand the situation. in case there are still doubts, feel free to contact me for further details. best of luck,"

"i there , a haven to been to the doctors about this but i feel i have a serious problem , the past few months a be been feeling lonely and vulnerable even when being around all my friends , a can be outside with a lot of people or in confined spaces with a lot of people . most of the time a feel like a have no one to talk to and a just feel like there is no point in me living , a be gotten to the point now that a have no idea what to do , a have a big group of amazing friends , and an amazing boyfriend , but a just feel so alone and worthless why am a feeling like this ? ?",1,33505,"his am chat doctor. i have been working with patients with strokes and bleeds for the past 10 years. unfortunately, there is little that will help the improvement of the paresis that you have. the most significant and beneficial therapy that helps in regaining motor functions and power is physiotherapy. as of now, there is no other known therapy that will help you regain the functions of the limbs. as to the duration to complete healing, the question cannot be answered with certainty. as of now, in your case, i need to know the size of the bleed, the extent of the bleed, the amount that is still there in the brain (of blood). these are just some of the factors that will prognosticate the weakness and paresis. the damage to the nerves in the brain that signal the movement of the limbs causes the paresis. the extent of damage cannot be predicted. the other parts of the brain have to take up the functions of the damaged part of the brain. this takes a lot of time and may sometimes be incomplete. so as of now, the only medical advice that can be given is to continue physiotherapy and stay motivated with it. feel free to contact me with any query you have or any clarification that you may need on any point. best of luck,"
