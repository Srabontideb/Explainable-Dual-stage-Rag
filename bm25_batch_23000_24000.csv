"i its been 6 months since i had sex with my hubby . starting having this month only . is long as i had unprotected sex with my hubby , i didst have any prob . for twice we had sex with condom recently . for past 3 days i am having very bad itching , and burning sensation with thick white discharge seen on the walls of my labia and vagina . it doesn't stain my panty.sometimes lower stomach pain too . a have had a sort of same thing last year too once , with more discharge staining my panty and i was prescribed consort cd , lucan and some antibiotics.i feel it could be latex or lubricant allergy of condom . would it be ? i need some over counter medications . i am in xxxxxx.pls advice",1,74504,"hello! thanks for using chat doctor.come read carefully your question and understand your concern. i think you had allergic to the latex condom spermicide. perhaps you are allergic to the latex condom, one of the most common allergic reactions caused by sexual intercourse. although they say it affects only 1% of people, you can actually develop the allergy or sensitivity to the condom with the progressive contact with the latex or the material from which the condom is made - and / or the lubricants and spermicides it contains. generally, the symptoms of the allergy to the condom appear within a few minutes of penetration, but then they may get worse. in cases of irritation, hives and more severe dermatitis occur hours later. for example, the formation of blisters on the skin that has been in contact with the latex is common. i see similar cases amongst young people who visit my clinic. in the first meeting, i advise my patients to avoid using latex condoms to prevent these symptoms, but obviously always remembering the important premise of practicing safe sex. if you are sensitive or allergic to latex, you can resort to polyurethane condoms or animal skin condoms. polyurethane condoms work in the same way as latex condoms: they offer protection against pregnancy and prevent sexually transmitted diseases. animal skin condoms, however, do not provide protection against stds. while commonly allergic to condoms is not too serious, exposing yourself to such symptoms over and over again can be both annoying and harmful and can compromise not only your sex life but your overall health. and here the situation can be worse. so the best advice i can give you is to consult with your urologist properly diagnose your case, analyze what risks you have been exposed to in contact with latex condoms, and of course know what other contraceptive methods you can use that are harmless and comfortable. kind regards,"

a was sent to an emergency room for continuing vomiting over a period of 3 hours and they gave me a shot of morphine to settle things down and to stop the vomiting . 4 days later a have some depression and a am wondering if this could be from the morphine .,1,23085,"hello, thanks for choosing chat doctor for posting your query. i have gone through your question in detail and i can understand what you are going through. morphine can cause depression, but it is mostly after a chronic use. after a single shot of morphine, depression cannot precipitate. moreover, for clinically diagnosing a depression, the symptoms have to persist for at least 2 weeks, which is not so in your case. just try getting back to your own life and commitments. hope i am able to answer your concerns. if you have any further query, i would be glad to help you. in future if you wish to contact me directly, you can use the below-mentioned link:bit.ly/ chat doctor."

i i had a miscarry april this year . since then i been trying to get present . recently i when to see a my doctor . he advice me to use ova-mit . by question is will i get pregnant if i have sex with my partner during the 5 days using the ova-mit.thanks,1,108096,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. it is true that theoretically you should have been clear of the injection within three months of discontinuation, however many women after being a depo-provera for a long time do not resume having ovulatory, regular, menstrual cycles until 6 to 9 months or even up to a year after discontinuation. unfortunately, it is difficult to artificially induce ovulation in women who are coming off depo-provera. if you were not trying to become pregnant, your cycle could be regulated temporarily with birth control pills, but if you're actually trying to get pregnant the best thing you can do with this point is to just keep trying and wait and see. if you feel any symptoms of pregnancy, and you haven't gotten your period for a while, i would do pregnancy test just to make sure. there is always a possibility even if your periods are not regular that you do ovulate sometimes. so in summary, continue having unprotected sex every other to every three days and give it some more time. 80% of couples will conceive within one year, and if after a year of trying you and your partner are unsuccessful, it might be a good idea to see a fertility specialist for an evaluation. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes, and good luck getting pregnant,"

hi there . i am trying to get pregnant . its been 1 and a half year now . i have a 2 year old son so i no i can conceive . my periods are irregular and the last time i was on was the 3rd of august and have not had one since . i have done a home prev test and its neg . i really want to get prev . some times i have pain were my ovaries are the funny thing is that i feel movements in my tummy . i really done no what is happening .,1,43820,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, i want to reassure you that no matter what your endometrial measurement may be, 80% of couples will conceive within one year naturally. couples are not diagnosed as infertile until you have been trying and been unable to become pregnant for over one year. endometrial thickness is really only relevant in the context of couples trying to get pregnant through in vitro fertilization. the thickness of your uterine lining is somewhat related to your estrogen levels. when couples are undergoing ivf, treating with additional estrogen can thicken the uterine lining. however, because you've been only trying to get pregnant for four months, your endometrial lining may have absolutely nothing to do with the reason why you have not yet conceived. furthermore, unless your husbands' sperm count has been shown to be decreased, magazine should not have any effect on fertility nor should affect any health of a developing baby should you conceive. medications taken during pregnancy by the mother can affect the fetus, but not any medication taken by the father, because medication cannot be transmitted before fertilization through sperm. so unless the medication causes the sperm count to be low or abnormal, there is no medical reason why your husband needs to be off his medication for colitis in order for you and need to conceive successfully. i suggest that if he needs the medication for his health that he continue to take it. as for is maximizing your chance of healthy pregnancy, the best thing you can do is get plenty of sleep, eat a well-balanced diet, take prenatal vitamins, and tried to have regular(at least 2 to 3 days a week) unprotected intercourse from the time your menstrual period finishes until you begin to feel premenstrual symptoms. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and i wish you and your husband the best of luck in conceiving. best wishes,"

"yes , i have pumps on my head that are peeled with clear liquid , hurt , itch , and cause my hair to break off above the root . antibiotics take it away but come back if i stop taking the beds .",1,6473,"it is never wrong to have a doctor look! statistics show that if a child hits her head but never loses consciousness, never throws up, cries right away or returns to play right away, and doesn't seem sleepy or unusually out of it after a head bump, then the chances of a serious injury being present are extremely low. most likely the nose/mouth got hit somehow on the way down or right when she hit, and that lead to the bleed. if it stopped right away, it is usually no cause for alarm. again, if anything at all seems off, it is always right to have the doctor take a look."

i a am 25 and have been trying to fall pregnant for 12 months have had 2 miscarriages and have been diagnosed with mild pics and am spending my time thinking about getting pregnant all the time looking closing at all the symptoms a get all the time waiting on my period and not wanting it to turn up and at the moment spend to much time googling online every little thing,1,19436,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. any woman having unprotected sex is at risk for pregnancy, so it certainly is possible that you may have conceived your first month. however, 80 percent of couples will conceive within one year, so if you divide that by 12 (for each month) you have about a 6 percent chance of conceiving per cycle. sperm live in the female genital tract for up to 72 hours, so it is generally recommended when trying to get pregnant to have sex every other day between the time your period finishes and the time you feel pms symptoms (which means you have already ovulated and can no longer conceive that cycle). so i would try to be patient and understand that it sometimes can take some time to become pregnant. in the meantime, i recommend you try to eat a healthy diet, get plenty of rest, avoid alcohol and smoking and begin to take folic acid, which is a b vitamin that has been shown to help prevent birth defects. 400 micrograms daily is the standard dose, which can be purchased alone or in prenatal vitamin preparations. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and i wish you the best of luck getting pregnant! best wishes,"

"hi , in night .i missed my period and its due date on 7 dec but could '' to come till yet.i have done a pregnancy test yesterday but the line at to appears lighter and the line at a is darker.so.i a in a doubt dat i a still pregnant or not.please clear my doubt",1,35396,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. if you have not yet missed your period, even if you are pregnant, the line will appear very faint on the pregnancy test as your hormone levels are extremely low at this time in pregnancy. so there is no reason to assume that the test was wrong as the greatest likelihood is that you are actually pregnant. however, women can have a situation where they have a positive pregnancy test and then get their normal period on time. this is known as a chemical pregnancy and is caused by the situation where the egg is fertilized but never implants into the uterus and continues to grow. so i encourage patients in general to try to avoid performing pregnancy test before they actually miss their period, as even though you have a positive pregnancy test this early, it does not guarantee that the pregnancy is going to take. if your cycle is late, there is no reason to assume that there is any problem with the pregnancy. if you do retest after you miss your period and the line is still very weekly positive, it may be reasonable to see a physician and get a blood test for the level of your pregnancy hormone. pregnancy hormone levels are supposed to double every 48 hours so by the time you miss your period the levels should be significantly high enough to produce a clear double line on the pregnancy test especially if you perform it with your first morning urine as recommended. low hormone levels in early pregnancy can indicate that the pregnancy is not developing properly or that it can be an ectopic or tubal pregnancy, which needs to be diagnosed and accurately managed by a physician. in the meantime however, i encourage you to stop chat doctor. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes and good luck with the pregnancy,"

by mama called me tonight saying her doctor is sending her to a oncologist dermatologist in the morning after two blood tests that showed extremely high white blood cells and low oxygen in her blood . the had her spleen removed 10 years ago and has to had any problems with it until recently with being run down and tired all the time what could this be,1,54619,"hi there, im sorry your granddaughter is having some health issues. let me explain each item in the report with the information you've provided me. phagocytosis are abnormal types of blood cells that are round instead of the usual disc shape. this can be quite common in patients with sickle cell anemia, as the body pushes out immature red blood cells due to the shortage of normal functioning blood cells. the spleen digests red blood cells that are normal, and in cases of sickle cell or other hematologic disease, can become enlarged due to the fact that it is working harder. if your granddaughter is very anemic or having low platelets, sometimes a splenectomy (removal of the spleen is warranted). if she's not having any difficulty with anemia or bleeding, then leaving the spleen in is an option. when red blood cells get broken down at an increased rate, this can cause gallstones to form in the gallbladder, which can also cause liver enzymes to be elevated. i don't believe that her kidney infection or type 1 diabetes are related to her sickle cell anemia, but if she's having recurrent abdominal pain (sickle cell crisis) and gallstones, it may not be a bad idea to consider having her gallbladder and spleen removed at the same time. finally, a small uterus is nothing to be concerned about in a 9-year-old. this sounds like an incidental finding. i hope i have answered your questions. please feel free to contact me should you have any further questions."

"of , a have recently had a biopsy on my throat . a am good no cancer . acid reflux . since this a have been working out . a have lost 25 pound in two weeks . a am 5 8 weighing 140 now . eating right , no caffeine , act . now a lump on my left rib cage has appeared it is tender to touch . there is a rash starting to form on it also . that do you think ?",1,33931,"hi michele jacobi the first thing that has to be done once you find a lump in the region of the chest wall is to confirm what it is. in your case a biopsy has already been done and let us await its result. you're understanding that cancerous lumps don't bleed after biopsy is correct. but i think your presumption that if it was scar tissue it would have bled is not correct. scar tissue also need not bleed. needle biopsies do not usually cause any bleeding unless a blood vessel is ruptured during the procedure since how long have you noticed this lump. is the size of the lump increasing ? if the biopsy comes as positive for cancer then you will have to undergo a series of investigation to find out he the extent of the disease. ? whether it is confined to the chest wall only or whether it has gone beyond the chest wall to other regions. treatment decision will depend on the results of this if the biopsy comes as negative for cancer then there are 2 options 1- if your physician thinks it is insignificant then you need to follow it up. just keep a check on your lump to see whether it is increasing in size and also get it checked by your physician regularly2- the second option (and my preference) is to do an open biopsy especially if the lump was detected recently and is increasing in size and also if the lump is firm to hard (and not very soft). the reason is needle biopsy can be negative, but this does not always mean there is no cancer especially if the tissue sample taken is not adequate. also time factor is important. you may lose time keeping the lump under follow up to see whether it is increasing in size hope you are satisfied with my reply. anyway don't worry. follow your doctors' advice chat doctor."

i a have been on demo for approx 2 years . a am 9 days late for my injection and a have had unprotected sex with my partner last night . now long before a know if a am pregnant . a am also due to get my injection today if pregnant what will happen to the pregnancy,1,22940,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, the depo-provera injection becomes immediately effective against pregnancy the day you get the shot. the reason why it is recommended for you to start taking demo while you have your period is to make sure that you have not already become pregnant and get the injection while pregnant. so if you had a shot two weeks ago, even if you had a condom accident, and especially since you took morning-after pill, there is no reason to suspect that you are risk for pregnancy. however, a urinary tract infection, which is inflammation of the bladder, can occur after sex if chafing during sex especially externally rubs bacteria into the urethra (the urinary opening). this is common in women who use condoms as the ring on the condom can irritate this area during penetration. so i think you can be reassured that your symptoms are not due to pregnancy. however, i think you most likely do have a uti and should visit your local physician or clinic for evaluation, so you can get a prescription for antibiotics to treat it. if you are now going to be having unprotected sex with your current partner, you both should be tested for stds to make sure that you are not at risk of giving anything to one another. however, this point there is no evidence that your symptoms could be caused by an std. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"hello in 23 yrs old . i have chest pains that come and go when they please . i have bloatingness in my lower stomach , my stomach makes hungry noises and in always belching . i have no idea what this can be and or how to get rid of the bloatingness from my lower stomach .... do you ?",1,51327,"i have crohn's disease which is an ibd. ibd is different from ibs but similar, ibd can only be determined by a colonoscopy. i am only 19 years old i am also a female and i have experienced pain similar to this. i had the heaviness on my chest, and pain in my upper right side. turns out your gall bladder is located on the upper right side of your stomach and your pancreas is located in the center of your upper stomach which can feel like pain in your chest. both of which could all hurt your abdomen intensely if you have gallstones. gallstones can cause pancreatitis, which in a nutshell is swelling of your pancreas. it just so happens that i had gallstones and pancreatitis. it was relieved by removal of my gallbladder. just to be safe you might want to go to the local her and get an ultrasound of your gallbladder and have them check your lipase levels."

"hello or . a have a problem with my lower back .and its affecting my legs also that a can to walk without being assisted . it gives me spasm sometimes.i get pains on my hips and to lie on my back is so painful . please , what can a do and what is wrong with me ?",2,29019,"dear-thanks for using our system and i understand your concern. back pain is a very common complaint, and it limits our movement and capacity to perform our daily activities. your pain most likely is secondary to a muscle spasm because it came with any trauma. it looks that you have a pinch nerve with is giving the radiation to the pain to the right side, this is what commonly gives a sciatic nerve neuralgia, because the sciatic nerve has roots that go to the legs and this can give your symptoms. when you stood up, the nerve became trapped and that is why you had the tightness of the right side and the pain. you can use cold alternating with hot 15 min a day 3 times a day for one week and analgesics. i hope that my advice will be helpful. chat doctor."

"hi , i have been ill for about 2 weeks with a flu , and i started having pains in my right lung , i thought it may be a chest infection so have been on antibiotics , after 6 days though the pain is still unbearable ... it feels like i have sprained a lung , or trapped some muscle in the ribs or something , when i use my left arm it hurts but it doesn't hurt to breathe - only if i take a big breathe",1,23776,"hello have gone through your question and understand your concern. people who cough very hard may strain their rib muscles or cartilage, causing pain in the chest, particularly when they breathe in, move, or cough again. it could also be pleuritic chest pain which is typically sharp and stabbing in a part of the chest. the pain is usually made worse when you breathe in or cough. use otc medications like paradox 500 mg every 6th holy for 3 days. if the symptoms does not improve or fever increases, see a gp for further examination to rule out lung infection."

"i , a have been suffering an abdominal pain , it is on my left side , higher then my belly button .... if a touch there , it is tender , almost like a dull , bruised pain inside .... sometimes a get pain without touching in the same area .... a am real worried as my family suffers from all sort of stomach problems : - ( have seen of twice , but they just said , they are sure is nothing serious , there is no always explanation to stomach pains ... shall a be worried or trust the doctors ...",1,21962,"dear simone, there is one rule for doctors here in croatia: when you think too much, stop, and think again, but this time think for the simplest diagnose. if you have pain in abdomen and an umbilical hernia seen on us then the first thing to think about is ""abdominal pain caused by hernia"":). there are many conditions in medicine where pain doesn't need to beau localized near the ""pathology"". sometimes pain can be felt on the opposite side of the affected organ. it is known that one of common symptom of myocardial infarction is pain in the left shoulder. also, infection of the abdominal organs can give many types and localizations of pain. the reason for it is simple: when i see pain, i see nerves, not organs (this is my own phrase:)). nerves conduct pain, and nerves are all around, going from periphery to the brain, so pain can be localized on its pathway, so just let's go back to your problem. doctor should tell you the size of hernia and its content which can be only preperitoneal tissue, momentum or even intestines. this dark triangle...mmm.it can be nothing and everything. i usually don't trust our ultrasonographer because they are strange people... sometimes they don't see what they need to see, or they see what they don't need to see. all i see is that us is operator-dependent diagnostic test... but we shouldn't underestimate this finding. it can be uterine moma, endometriosis, cyst or tumor. and yes, it can cause pain you're describing. so what you need to do: 1. ct scan of pelvic and abdominal region. why? as i said, these us findings are always doubtful, ct is a high sensitive test which will find the exact problem for sure. it will tell you the size and severity of hernia and the morphology of this uterine lesion. it can also find some other problems in its early phase."

( by son is 18 years old ) .,3,104085,"! jacky i really appreciate your efforts for the treatment for your son, and you are not overreacting at all. from what you have said in question i can say from my clinical experience that your son is having some autistic features (as he strictly follows the same routine and throws tantrums when routine is changed). his mood swings might be related to such events as i can guess otherwise he would talk to you normally. you have not mentioned so, but such people are also strict about their dietary habits and may go to extremes patterns to follow it. the point which is against autism is that he developed this pattern just a year back and not from childhood. such features are also seen in a condition called ocd. you have said that he looks depressed, which can be seen in ocd (comorbid depression). you have mentioned mood fluctuations in which one side is that -- he gets angry and yells and screams, but the other side is not reflective of manic features, so, i donor think that he is bipolar. however, making a correct diagnosis the psychiatrist must interview the patient herself. one thing is definite that your son needs help and i'm sure that medicines will help him a lot, more than you may even think of. so, i would suggest that you must make a visit to a psychiatrist with him. when medicine will start showing effect his diet will also improve apart from his behavior, this will help in managing diabetes as well. you have asked if these symptoms are related to diabetes or not. well, i have not gone across any such research work till now where diabetes itself is a cause for such symptoms in any patient. so, it looks unlikely to be so. as you have mentioned that he had a breakup, which can be taken as a stressor, i think it might be related to his current condition to some extent. hope the reply is useful for feel free to ask more questions"

"pm a 54 year old women the last month and a half i have had sore/pain inside my arms , neck and legs also sometimes my joints a feeling of coming down with a sore troat the pain kinda move all over its very frustrating because i do not feel like myself sent to gabo in december and was feeling great this started 1 week after i came home also i stopped having my period for 2 months but is now back would this be fibromyolga ?",1,33341,"hi, if you came to my clinic with those complaints i would ask you to stop worrying. many women that start using the pills for the first time experience similar problems. i understand that you have taken the inactive pills first and then started on the active pills. also, you have had intercourse only after your period was over that is about 11 days ago. the chances of pregnancy occurring after a single act of unprotected sexual intercourse are only 4%. also, for women that have regular periods the chance of getting pregnant is more if intercourse occurs after 11-12 days since the first day of the period. hence, the chances of getting pregnant are low if you have had contact before this period. you are also having a sick feeling in the stomach and most probably a cramp like feeling. this may be due to the pills as some females take time to get adjusted and may improve with continuous use and by taking the pills with food. the pills are not known to cause any major effect on the baby if they are inadvertently taken in early pregnancy. since you have started taking the active pills late, i would recommend that you use a backup contraceptive measure like condoms, for the next 7 days while you still take the pills to avoid pregnancy. i would be pleased to answer any further queries that you may have, enjoy a wonderful day."

"i all and one , a just had a tooth extraction done monday just gone . as glad to find that a done have a dry socket but several things are worrying me : firstly it looks like 2 roots have been left in there , can this be right ? will it have complications later on ? is the tooth was suppose to be taken out due to pus being developed on the gum and was infecting everything around it , .. ? secondly , the tooth next to it its gum split ... one side is flopping around ? will it grow back together ? shall a be rebooting to go and see the dentist ? thank you in advance",1,53390,hi. can understand your concern. as per your complaint the swollen gum and the white material inside it is a result of some inflammation. there can be a few reasons depending upon whether it is the second molar or the wisdom tooth. in case it is a wisdom tooth which is erupting or is impacted then the gum above it can get infected and inflamed due to either food deposition between the gum and the wisdom tooth or it can be due to gum flap bitten by the opposite jaw tooth and the condition is known as peritonitis. the white material in it is pus. in case it is second molar the swollen gum with white material in it can be as a result of infection in the gums due to deposits on the teeth like plaque or calculus or due to foreign body impaction in the gums which carries infection along with it deeper into the gums causing pus formation. it can also be due to deeply infected tooth causing pus formation below the tips of the roots of the tooth causing swelling on the gums with pus inside. i would suggest you to consult a dentist and get evaluated for the exact cause of the swelling and get treated accordingly. in case if it is wisdom tooth either excision of gum flap or extraction if the tooth is impacted followed by antibiotics and painkillers can be done. in case of gum infection professional cleaning of teeth followed by antibiotics and gum paints can help. in case of tooth infection root canal treatment or extraction depending on the condition of the tooth can be done. hope your query is solved. if you find the answer helpful please write a positive review and click on find this answer helpful as a token of appreciation. thanks and regards. chat doctor.

(regular use of emergency pill is harmful)conception occurs if she was in 10th to 18th day of her cycle(in a regular cycle of 28 day duration). you can ask her at what day she is in and wait for next cycle to occur. if it delayed by 7 days then get done upt to diagnose if pregnant and then the required treatment can be taken. regards"

"a have numbness in face , fingers , and feet and am fatigued . a had severe pneumonia 14 years ago , and in icu for 15 days and almost didst make it . a was diagnosed with mild bronchiectasis , asthma , and have some abnormal put numbers . by pulmonologist told me , a would suffer with sinusitis and a have . would this numbness be caused by sinusitis/lung problem ?",1,44715,"hello, i can understand your concern. it would have been helpful if you had mentioned which tooth was treated for root canal. as you are mentioning that the tooth was black and had cracks in it, i am assuming that the tooth is in the lower front region, and you had had some trauma to the lower jaw area which made the tooth dead and also hurt the chin and lip. other possibility is that if the tooth was dead for many years, it may have developed a periapical cyst in relation with the tooth which might be pressing on the mental nerve supplying lower lip and chin and may cause numbness of those areas. alternatively, the numbness may have started after taking local anesthesia in the lower front area for some tooth problem and the injection might have been given deep. in any case, it seems that the nerve supplying sensation to the lower front area of jaw along with lower lip and chin (mental nerve) is damaged. usually, if the nerve is damaged, it can regenerate in 3-6 months and the sensations can return. if you are not sure regarding the crown on the tooth, you can avoid it for some months and take care not to bite hard things with that tooth so that it does not fracture. you can get the crown after the numbness is solved. i would also advise you to visit an oral and maxillofacial surgeon for the examination of the area and regarding numbness. he/she might take an x-ray to rule out presence of periapical lesion or cyst in relation with the tooth. crown should surely be postponed until this possibility is ruled out. i hope this information helps you. thank you for choosing chat doctor. i wish you feel better soon. best,"

"be and my of were fooling around and he rubbed his penis on my vagina , this was 5 months ago.i be been having periods but they always start of as stringy black blood but turn into full periods , they have been coming every 2 weeks , a also have taken 4 pregnancy tests all a different times since the incident , last one was 19 weeks after , all have been negative . a have convinced myself a a pregnant , a had irregular periods before this also but not with the dark blood . would the prev test still read negative this far along ?",1,67327,"dear madam, i do empathize your concern. however, the first cardinal symptom of pregnancy is missing a period (though occasionally some women may get menses in first couple of months of pregnancy). you had periods, however, somewhat lighter. this should be taken into consideration. the other symptoms follow about one or two weeks later. they are:* nausea and vomiting with pica: you do not seem to have them.* frequency of urination which you do not seem to have.* breast changes: - engorgement and tenderness which you are having-dark discoloration of the nipples and areola: this also you have noticed. along with this, the size of areola also increases. are there any tubercles under the areola? they will go more in favor of pregnancy. - secretions from the nipples: they will be strongly supporting the pregnancy. we do not diagnose the pregnancy only on the symptoms; they have to be supported by confirmatory evidences like pregnancy test and/or clinical findings. however, your pregnancy test is negative. madam, i feel you have carried out this test rather too early. these tests may report false negative in the first week after missed period. hence, repeat the test after about 4 days; however, going for beta chat doctor test would be more reliable. this is highly specific and sensitive test. the levels of chat doctor > 25 will confirm the pregnancy. if this test also reveals that you are not pregnant, you have to accept the diagnosis and attribute the symptoms to some other cause like increase in weight or so. let the bluish discoloration of vagina be confirmed by gynecologist instead of a lay person like your husband. i hope this has given you a valid clue to resolve your dilemma."

hello in 30yr old male weigh about 480lbs i smoke a pack every 3 days the other day i had some minor chest discomfort that i went to or to check out egg was good heart was good 88bpm blood pressure was a tad high and thyroid was all good but in still having the same problem ?,1,1425,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, i want to tell you that the antibiotics you took in the first pack should not interfere with the birth control you took, and the fact that you got a normal period on time means you do not have to worry about pregnancy. missing two or more pills in a row usually causes some breakthrough bleeding a few days after the missed pills, even if you make them up. this is the bleeding you are experiencing now. it most likely will stop eventually, but may continue until you finish this pack. you maximize the possibility of stopping the spotting by trying to take your pills at the same time every day. a way you can help remember your daily pill is to take it at the same time as some routine activity you do every day, for example brushing your teeth, or having a morning coffee. carrying your pills in your purse all the time can also help if you do not consistently stay in the same place every night. i hope i was able to answer your question today and that this information was helpful. best wishes,"

"hello , there is a 2 inch wide , five inch long bump going down my chest . it is in the middle of my chest , it goes from the lower part of my upper chest to my bellybutton , its like a thick long bump . it looks like a thick tube , it is not firm , but somewhat soft . would this be cancerous ? a just discovered it today . thanks .",1,33931,"hi michele jacobi the first thing that has to be done once you find a lump in the region of the chest wall is to confirm what it is. in your case a biopsy has already been done and let us await its result. you're understanding that cancerous lumps don't bleed after biopsy is correct. but i think your presumption that if it was scar tissue it would have bled is not correct. scar tissue also need not bleed. needle biopsies do not usually cause any bleeding unless a blood vessel is ruptured during the procedure since how long have you noticed this lump. is the size of the lump increasing ? if the biopsy comes as positive for cancer then you will have to undergo a series of investigation to find out he the extent of the disease. ? whether it is confined to the chest wall only or whether it has gone beyond the chest wall to other regions. treatment decision will depend on the results of this if the biopsy comes as negative for cancer then there are 2 options 1- if your physician thinks it is insignificant then you need to follow it up. just keep a check on your lump to see whether it is increasing in size and also get it checked by your physician regularly2- the second option (and my preference) is to do an open biopsy especially if the lump was detected recently and is increasing in size and also if the lump is firm to hard (and not very soft). the reason is needle biopsy can be negative, but this does not always mean there is no cancer especially if the tissue sample taken is not adequate. also time factor is important. you may lose time keeping the lump under follow up to see whether it is increasing in size hope you are satisfied with my reply. anyway don't worry. follow your doctors' advice chat doctor."

a have recently been getting terrific tooth pain when flying the dentist says it is not from my teeth and a finished a treatment of antibiotics and prednisone for sinuses prior to my last flight and still had terrible pain both up and lower on left side by jaw became very warm also after about 30 min at cruising altitude the pain resides an you help ?,1,66334,"hello, i can understand your concern. have you ever been to a dentist after the pain started? pain that isl involving only one side of face and throbbing in nature when you lay down indicates possible presence of the decayed tooth. when we lay down, the blood supply towards the head and face increases. this also causes increased blood supply in the teeth. if a tooth is infected or decayed, this increased blood supply can cause severe throbbing pain. the pain gets little relieved after one wakes up and sits. in addition, if the upper tooth is infected or decayed, it can cause pain in cheek bone, upper jaw and lower jaw and area around nose. thus, you should visit a dentist for examination of the oral cavity and looking for any carious tooth that can cause such pain. if that indeed is a cause, then getting treatment of the infection, root canal treatment, will clear the infection and relieve you of pain. by the time you visit a dentist, ibuprofen 400 mg or motorola dt 10 mg up to thrice a day will help in relieving pain. i hope this answer helps you. thank you for choosing chat doctor. i wish you feel better soon. best,"

(as you said he has difficulty in walking now). you can also say to his parents that --- they can continue with all religious customs along with medicines, may be then they will agree... with medicine, he will start showing improvement in few days only... it is psychosis and patients will not agree to go to any doctor willingly, so you might need to take him forcefully. this is well accepted as it is for his benefit only. even if he doesn't agree for oral medicine there are injectables which are given to such patients... take the right step, take him to a doctor. hope the reply is useful feel free to ask more questions"
"hello doctor , i a a male 17 years and a height of 5 6 and a weight of 55 kg.i was diagnosed with mild mitral valve prolapse and was given beta blocker for fast heart rate .from a few days now i have started to get new symptoms like chest pains , and digestive problems.i have taken 2 egg a which showed no problem with the heart.the problem now is i sometimes get blurred or distorted vision , which is only for a few seconds followed by rapid heart beats.after this episode i feel very tired and anxious.i want to know if the new symptoms which i a getting due to map or a more serious heart problem .",1,100009,"greetings! thank you for your question and welcome to chat doctor. i carefully read your query. mitral valve prolapse (mvp) is a benign condition that is estimated to be found in 16% of young ladies, and it may take up to forty or fifty years to produce symptoms, only after a chronic mitral regurgitation is installed. i would go on and say that further clinical investigation should be in order at this time, but i am quite confident that, if something was wrong with the mitral valve and the mitral regurgitation was there, it would have been told to you during the before 6 months echocardiogram. it would be only when a mitral regurgitation produced by a mitral valve prolapse that would enlarge the left atrium, when the high pressures in the enlarged left atrium would produce shortness of breath and, maybe, rapid heart rate corresponding with an atrial arrhythmia. and it would have shown in the echocardiogram, if the left atrium was enlarged. my opinion is that your problem is not being produced by the mitral valve prolapse, at this moment, at least. however, if this is a worrisome situation to you, then another echocardiogram should be done. of course, if mitral valve is found on a bad shape, after carefully measuring the function, size, and grade of regurgitation, adding to the possible symptoms, it is only then when mitral valve should be surgically replaced. as for the stress side, indeed substantial amounts of stress have their clear effect on the heart, by putting it to a significant dynamic state and by producing a chat doctor. there are a lot of natural means to reduce stress, starting from self-fighting of the stress to yoga or other methods. if this becomes problematic to you and affects your quality of life and work, i would recommend you a consult with a clinical psychologist regarding a course of sedatives to reduce it. i hope i was helpful. best regards."

i ! a have cough and colds and a have my ray . results state that there are fine reticular infiltrates in my left upper lung which may relate to pulmonary tuberculosis of undetermined activity . is the result accurate ? now can this be addressed accordingly ?,1,87733,"hello, i read your message and understood your medical issue. i see that you have a persistent chat doctor. i don't know what you have used to treat it, but this is quite a long period of time for the symptom to be self-limited even if left without any treatment. when laughing, much more pressure develops inside the pulmonary system which makes the obstruction of the airways to become more evident. chest discomfort and the sense of pressure in the chest followed by a more severe cough especially after a physical efforts are signs that show that the pulmonary function is getting down. it can be due to pneumonia of course or as a side effect of the previous pneumonia episodes. in this case, the pulmonary function is reduced because of atelectasis which is the substitution of the pulmonary tissue with fibrous tissue. anyway, i do not think that this is your case even though i do not expel it as a differential diagnosis. what i think is a possibility of herd (gastroesophageal reflux disease) which has not been treated adequately and might have caused aspiration pneumonia. anyway further tests are needed to rule it out and treat it adequately like chest x-ray, upper endoscopy and a good physical examination. bronchitis may become chronic and may lead to more severe pulmonary disease like copd. my suggestion is that you must see your doctor and do the respiratory tests to evaluate the function of your lungs. chest x-ray is very important in this case. it can be due to an allergic reaction as well. maybe you are constantly exposed to the allergic substance that causes obstruction to the airway and produces the symptoms. mediastinum organs like large vessels, trachea, lymph nodes etc. must be evaluated. tumors in this region, also the pulmonary tumors are not usual and if found they are successfully treated. my advice is that you must do at least the pulmonary tests, a chest x-ray and all the random laboratory examinations and if you can do the allergic tests. hope this is helpful for you."

i ! a have cough and colds and a have my ray . results state that there are fine reticular infiltrates in my left upper lung which may relate to pulmonary tuberculosis of undetermined activity . is the result accurate ? now can this be addressed accordingly ?,3,84526,"hellothanks for posting at chat doctor. i have gone through your history. since you have been completely evaluated for the heart including a thallium and presenting scan, there is no need to seek a cardiac evaluation now. since you had dvt with pulmonary embolism, it may be possible that some amount of lung tissue was affected by the embolism and infarcted. this may be the reason of cough and the chest pain. another reason for cough can be lung congestion brought on due to atrial fibrillation. but you have mentioned that you had only one episode of af so i suppose, you have reverted to sinus rhythm. in your case, i suspect there is a lung issue more than a heart involvement. i recommend a chest x-ray initially and if it shows any abnormalities, a hrct chest to look for lung issues. cardiac wise you need no evaluation except an ecg. wishing you good healthregards."

that is a healthy fgr for kidney function and creatine reading . a am a 72 year old male,3,81090,"hi, thanks for writing in. the creatinine level in blood shows the ability of the kidney to help in filtration of blood. the normal creatinine level in blood is less than 1.3 in most clinics. if your creatinine level in blood is 1.84 then it is increased. this can mean that the kidney filtration rate has decreased with time. a nephrologist is the specialist in kidney disease, and they will evacuate kidney function in detail and suggest investigations like urinary protein, creatinine clearance and if required then a nuclear scan based on your clinical symptoms and medical history. occasionally food habits can cause increase in blood creatinine level and this is to be discussed. research shows an increase in serum creatinine can result from increased ingestion of cooked meat (which contains creatinine converted from creatine by the heat from cooking) or increased intake of protein and creatine supplements, in excess of the recommended dosage and therefore requires you to talk to your doctor. please do not worry."

"a have experienced a weird chest pain in my upper left chest over the last couple of months . it has only came within 5-10 minute periods and only once every week or so . it feels like tightness and small stabbing . cd say its right underneath the arm pit , but positions right where the chest curves . more precisely its at the same height as my nipple . a am a male and 19 years old",1,51327,"i have crohn's disease which is an ibd. ibd is different from ibs but similar, ibd can only be determined by a colonoscopy. i am only 19 years old i am also a female and i have experienced pain similar to this. i had the heaviness on my chest, and pain in my upper right side. turns out your gall bladder is located on the upper right side of your stomach and your pancreas is located in the center of your upper stomach which can feel like pain in your chest. both of which could all hurt your abdomen intensely if you have gallstones. gallstones can cause pancreatitis, which in a nutshell is swelling of your pancreas. it just so happens that i had gallstones and pancreatitis. it was relieved by removal of my gallbladder. just to be safe you might want to go to the local her and get an ultrasound of your gallbladder and have them check your lipase levels."

i .... my breath stinks like poop and this is causing me problems everyday.i . i have had this problem since my teens and in now 32 . the problem seems to worsen when in stressed and has also worsened after a gave birth .. a have had of rely of sweets and sugar free gum to mask the problem but now these done help ... i have tried most brands of mouthwashes and oxygen toothpaste and these have not helped ... now one of my tooth has a cavity and has worsened the problem even further . in going to get this removed soon but a know the problem will persist as i had bad breath before the cavity . by life has been ruined and i cant form any meaningful relationships with other people !,1,22667,"dear patient, i can understand your concern and feel sorry for the pain you are suffering from. you are informing me that when you got the upper molar extracted, the dentist told you that the bone between the sinus and tooth is destroyed and sinus cavity is open. roots of upper molar often are found inside the maxillary sinus, which causes opening of the sinus cavity while extraction of the tooth, creating an oro-antral fistula, that is a direct connection between oral cavity and sinus cavity. in this case, the food or water you take has chances of passing infection in the sinus through mouth and the infection does not resolve. it is mandatory to close this connection between mouth and the sinus. it could be done by the dentist by taking stitches in the area when he found that sinus has opened, but it can also be done now. however, as about 2 weeks has passed since extraction, the opening would not be as much clear as it would have been during extraction. a blood clot may have filled the area. so what you need to do now is, go to an oral surgeon or an ent specialist. i know you have insurance problem, but there seems no other solution to your problem. you might have to go for x-rays and probably ct scan of the area to diagnose if oro-antral fistula actually exists and if it does, you might have to go for a little surgery to close the communication between mouth and sinus followed by antibiotics to resolve the infection. i hope this information helps. thank you for choosing chat doctor. i wish you get well soon. best,"

"by husband had oral surgery ( wisdom tooth and molar extraction , has stitches ) this morning at 11:30am . it is now 10 hours later and he is complaining that he feels like his throat and uvula have been scratched and they hurt pretty bad . this is even after taking a vicodin and a motrin . is this worth calling the oral surgeon over ?",1,22667,"dear patient, i can understand your concern and feel sorry for the pain you are suffering from. you are informing me that when you got the upper molar extracted, the dentist told you that the bone between the sinus and tooth is destroyed and sinus cavity is open. roots of upper molar often are found inside the maxillary sinus, which causes opening of the sinus cavity while extraction of the tooth, creating an oro-antral fistula, that is a direct connection between oral cavity and sinus cavity. in this case, the food or water you take has chances of passing infection in the sinus through mouth and the infection does not resolve. it is mandatory to close this connection between mouth and the sinus. it could be done by the dentist by taking stitches in the area when he found that sinus has opened, but it can also be done now. however, as about 2 weeks has passed since extraction, the opening would not be as much clear as it would have been during extraction. a blood clot may have filled the area. so what you need to do now is, go to an oral surgeon or an ent specialist. i know you have insurance problem, but there seems no other solution to your problem. you might have to go for x-rays and probably ct scan of the area to diagnose if oro-antral fistula actually exists and if it does, you might have to go for a little surgery to close the communication between mouth and sinus followed by antibiotics to resolve the infection. i hope this information helps. thank you for choosing chat doctor. i wish you get well soon. best,"

is it usual to have swelling in the mouth neck and jaw with pain from a canker sore ? ? a have rheumatoid arthritis as well with painful joints often and when a get stressed a get these cankers on the sides of my mouth its just this time its affecting my neck and jaw line . will antibiotics help the cankers go away ?,1,92591,"hi. welcome to chat doctor . i have gone through your query and can understand your concern.... as per your complaint it seems that you had a dislodged condole [the portion of the jaw that makes a joint with the underside of skull] due to excessive opening of the mouth along with jerky movements leading to dislocation of the jaw and as only one side of jaw must have dislodged, so you had deviation of jaw, and many a time the dislocated jaw rebounds back to its anatomical position either itself or manually placed by a dentist. clicking sound may however be due to some abnormality with the articular disk that is a soft cushion present between the two bony portions of the joint, and it may have displaced from its place or may be ruptured leading to clicking. you should take care as in case if you open the mouth too wide again the jaw can displace again. i would suggest you to consult an oral physician and get evaluated and get an orthopantomogram [opg] done to rule out the abnormality and get treated accordingly. you can do warm compresses over the joint. take a combination of muscle relaxant like chlorzoxasone and painkiller like ibuprofen. take soft diet and avoid opening mouth too wide. hope this information helps. thanks and regards. chat doctor. ."
