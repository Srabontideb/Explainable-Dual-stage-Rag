a have been having my period for 4 weeks straight now and a am on the pill . starting tomorrow a should be on my period but a never stopped since a started a week early last month . a have had blood clots and now they are getting larger . when should a see the doctor ?,1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"by daughter is 22 years old . the was fine until august , 2012 , she was admitted into the hospital for a virus . the was dehydrated and blood pressure dropped very low . the was overloaded with fluid and had to be transferred to a bigger hospital . the has had tremendous amount of pain in legs , wrists , complains now of headaches and memory loss . the was diagnosed with fibromyalgia but now her reumotologist is testing for lupus . would this have occurred from fluid overload or do you think it was already in her system",1,91332,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the complication of getting blood clots in the legs, called a dvt, or groin is uncommon but not rare during pregnancy. normally, the clock will gradually disappear with the aid of blood thinners. it actually takes somewhere between one even more than three months for the clock to actually dissolve and be reabsorbed by the bloodstream. therefore, the symptoms of pain, and swelling in the leg where the blockage occurred are not unusual while this is taking place. the most dangerous complication of a blood clot in the legs for pregnant woman is if a piece of the clot actually breaks off it can travel through the bloodstream towards the lungs and cause serious complications for breathing and sometimes even death. so symptoms your daughter-in-law should watch out for our shortness of breath, chest pain, or feeling very anxious with a rapid heartbeat. in terms of pain control for right now, applying a hot water bottle (comfortably hot) to the groin or soaking in a warm bath can help to relieve the pain symptoms at this time. your daughter-in-law should discuss the further management of her blood clot with her doctor but in the meantime it is much too early to see improvement in the pain. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was helpful. best wishes to your daughter-in-law for the rest of her pregnancy,"

"i , my daughter had minor surgery on the underside of her foot 5 months ago that still has not healed . the cut is over 2 cams long , uninfected and the sides have remained apart for this time . the has been offered further surgery under a general anaesthetic but really does not want to go down this route after being told there is no guarantee that this will work either . the is fourteen , has been using crutches for this time and not been enjoying life . her consultant just says come back in 6 weeks when we visit and suggested a take away a crutch , leaving her in agony when she puts weight on the wound . please can a have any advice ?",1,4054,"greetingswelcome to chat doctor. wound remaining open for 5 months is a very long time indeed and i completely understand how much pain you daughter much be feeling. well here it is important to know here what surgery was done initially so that the underlying problem can be identified which could be causing the wound to remain open. secondly to really find out if the wound is uninfected you will have to visit you doctor because infected would doesn't necessarily mean lots of pus. as far as the advice of you doctor is concerned to undergo a surgery, i say it would be a wise decision because no matter what medication your daughter takes or how clean you keep the wound, the wound will not heal if the ends of the wound have not been approximated. this will quickly start the healing process with very good antibiotics with broad spectrum coverage. she might be reluctant, but if you counsel her that surgical intervention again has good chances of healing your wound, i am sure she will be ready. after all it's going to be under general anesthesia and she wouldn't feel a thing. i hope the answer was helpful. in case you have any further questions feel free to contact in writing. regards. chat doctor."

hi a am trying to get pregnant and a was prescribed proverb for ten days my cycle came on and the ten days are up . be and my husband have not used a condom since then . by question is how long would it take to get pregnant after getting off of proverb ?,1,9011,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. since you have been pregnant before, there is no reason to expect that you should not be able to conceive spontaneously after going off the demo proverb. the fact that you terminated your pregnancies does not have any long term effects on your ability to conceive, and demo, once it is out of your system, does not have any bearing on your fertility or ability to have a healthy child. certainly there is no reason to delay trying to get pregnant if that is what you and your partner desire. however, sometimes it can take 6 months to even a year after stopping demo for your ovulation to return consistently, so if you do not conceive easily right away, there is no reason to be concerned. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful. best wishes,"

hi a am trying to get pregnant and a was prescribed proverb for ten days my cycle came on and the ten days are up . be and my husband have not used a condom since then . by question is how long would it take to get pregnant after getting off of proverb ?,3,108096,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. it is true that theoretically you should have been clear of the injection within three months of discontinuation, however many women after being a depo-provera for a long time do not resume having ovulatory, regular, menstrual cycles until 6 to 9 months or even up to a year after discontinuation. unfortunately, it is difficult to artificially induce ovulation in women who are coming off depo-provera. if you were not trying to become pregnant, your cycle could be regulated temporarily with birth control pills, but if you're actually trying to get pregnant the best thing you can do with this point is to just keep trying and wait and see. if you feel any symptoms of pregnancy, and you haven't gotten your period for a while, i would do pregnancy test just to make sure. there is always a possibility even if your periods are not regular that you do ovulate sometimes. so in summary, continue having unprotected sex every other to every three days and give it some more time. 80% of couples will conceive within one year, and if after a year of trying you and your partner are unsuccessful, it might be a good idea to see a fertility specialist for an evaluation. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes, and good luck getting pregnant,"

hi i just had my arena removed ... : birth control .. and i started bleeding the next day and i had it for a week .. but its really heavy and extremely painful cramping .. i have been using tampons ... and big globes of blood have been coming out ... is this normal,1,77098,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. many women who have been on birth control for many years can develop a tolerance of sorts for the pills' ability to control your menstrual cycle, especially after they have not menstruated for a long time due to pregnancy or another cause. this can also occur to the fact that you did relatively recently give birth, especially if you were breastfeeding. bleeding when you are not supposed to have your period on the pill is called breakthrough bleeding. it does not mean the pill is ineffective as a contraceptive, but having some irregular bleeding in between periods or a different bleeding pattern that you may have had before the pregnancy is not unusual. having heavy bleeding in the morning is likely due to the blood accumulating in your vagina during the night, and then it all comes out at once when you get out of bed due to gravity. your cycle may get back to normal after a few more months on the pill, and taking it as close to the same time every day will help to reduce the risk of breakthrough bleeding. if it continues for more than 3 months, you may benefit from changing your birth control brand to one with a slightly higher dose of estrogen, as the estrogen in the pill is the ingredient that controls your menstrual cycle. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

a had an epidural steroid/ cortisone injection for sciatic nerve / back pain this morning - after dinner and glass of white wine - my heart started racing - this has happened in the past but only after running / exercise - my heart rate now is about 135 bpr - any connection with the injection and rapid heart rate - 66 year old white male .,1,76022,"greetings. welcome to chat doctor, and thank you for your question. i understand your concern. usually, during flu and other infectious issues in the organism, that are accompanied by fever, there is a hyperkinetic state and the organism has to regulate itself to cope with this strain. one of the compensatory mechanisms in hyperkinetic states is the rapid heart rate. furthermore, the center of temperature regulation in the human body is settled in the hypothalamus, the highest regulator in the brain. due to this engagement, also the heart rate goes up. as for the other concern, that heart beats fast when moving around, in case of dilated cardiomyopathy, it is accompanied by heart insufficiency. this insufficient heart cannot cope as easily as a normal heart with a workload put onto it. therefore, also here, the heart rate compensates as much as it can, for the strain put onto the heart. to illustrate it more figuratively to understand it more clearly, imagine the heart is a donkey, and an enlarged heart is like an old donkey, and it is clear that the two donkeys cannot cope in the same way with the same loads put on their back. as about the atrial fibrillation, i would need further information to ad chat doctor. however, if this is an enlarged heart caused by ischemic reason, then an antiarrhythmic such as amiodarone, would be appropriate to treat or prevent this supraventricular arrhythmia. i hope i was helpful with my answer. feel free to ask again. take care."

(1) let me give you some information about clinical trial for genotype-3 treatment, it shows that 24 week treatment only cures 65% of patients so in order to achieve or cover the complete 100% case it needs to have 40 weeks treatment, so in theory we will be able to cure 100% cases. but we are taking year worth of medicine will cure you of hep-c with 130% result, hope it makes sense, if not try to read it again, more over in simple words you will be cured completely even before 12 months of medication but you are a reoccurrence case so taking medication for 12 months is a great option. (2) now let talk about the pcr- it reduced by many folds from 922,812 iu/ml to 1600 iu/ml. it's the best result one can have. so from that estimate the pcr will be near zero in next 3 months, but please continue taking medication as physician has asked for, as this is a naught disease and can reoccur if not cured completely.

"a recently noticed a little small lump , inside the scrotum like by my left testicle , doesn't give me any pain nor bothers me . cd also like to mention in 15 male , pm not sure if this is normal or what ? but a heard of cancer this cancer that .. pm just uncertain .",1,33931,"hi michele jacobi the first thing that has to be done once you find a lump in the region of the chest wall is to confirm what it is. in your case a biopsy has already been done and let us await its result. you're understanding that cancerous lumps don't bleed after biopsy is correct. but i think your presumption that if it was scar tissue it would have bled is not correct. scar tissue also need not bleed. needle biopsies do not usually cause any bleeding unless a blood vessel is ruptured during the procedure since how long have you noticed this lump. is the size of the lump increasing ? if the biopsy comes as positive for cancer then you will have to undergo a series of investigation to find out he the extent of the disease. ? whether it is confined to the chest wall only or whether it has gone beyond the chest wall to other regions. treatment decision will depend on the results of this if the biopsy comes as negative for cancer then there are 2 options 1- if your physician thinks it is insignificant then you need to follow it up. just keep a check on your lump to see whether it is increasing in size and also get it checked by your physician regularly2- the second option (and my preference) is to do an open biopsy especially if the lump was detected recently and is increasing in size and also if the lump is firm to hard (and not very soft). the reason is needle biopsy can be negative, but this does not always mean there is no cancer especially if the tissue sample taken is not adequate. also time factor is important. you may lose time keeping the lump under follow up to see whether it is increasing in size hope you are satisfied with my reply. anyway don't worry. follow your doctors' advice chat doctor."

by husband has been having pain in his groin and abdomen on the the left side . be went to urgent care the other day . they took x-rays did not find anything gave him a prescription for tylenol codeine and said that he should see a urologist . the problem is our insurance does not seem to cover a urologist as they are all telling us they do not accept it . the doctor said he may have varicose seal .,1,90927,"hi, i am chat doctor. i have read your message. i think i can help you. first, the symptoms that you have described are highly suggestive of seizures. here is why- 1. they come in night-seizures are commonly triggered when the patient sleeps or just around the sleep. of course, they can occur at other times too.2. they start from the leg and move up and then spread to the rest of the body.3. the episodes last 3-4 minutes and then resolves. i assume (you have not mentioned it) that it is never remembered by him, the episode that is. i think you should both take it very seriously. there is a high possibility that there is an intracranial problem that he is having which is extending and progressing undetected in the brain just because you do not want to visit a neurologist. i think you should meet a neurologist as soon as possible and request an mri brain (with spectroscopy if needed) and video eeg. if he does turn out to have a pathology, treatment will have to be initiated for the pathology in addition to regular anti-epileptic medicines. i suggest taking a video of these episodes that he is having. it may help convince him that he needs to visit a doctor, and it may be helpful to the doctor in seeing the condition that your husband has. yes, you need to visit a neurologist as soon as possible. ideally, i would also like to know if he has been having headaches for the past years? does he seem to be having episodes where he does not recollect what he has been doing for a certain duration of time? you may need to talk to his colleagues at work and find out if he has been having seizures or any abnormal behavior at work. there is a high chance that he knows that he has been having seizures at work and not telling you about it. i have tried my best to help you. unfortunately, i cannot initiate / suggest medicines as long as the diagnosis is not confirmed because the anti-epileptics may have severe side effects. best of luck,"

a live with my sister who is 59 and mentally handicapped . the has lived alone for a longtime and will not go to a doctor . a a noticing she has an occasional hacking cough and her skin looks yellow . her eating habits are terrible but she will only eat what she feels like eating . the a about 4 10 and maybe 90lbs . not any ideas ? a can to force her to go to either a doctor or a dentist .,1,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

a have a small lump that seems to leak puss just above my anus . it is painless but irritating as a know its there . a have been to the doctors twice about this back in november but they tell me it a just a blocked gland or duct . it does to seem to be going though . an you help ?,1,12056,"hi. thanks for the query. a hard painless lump under the jaw can be due to a number of reasons like 1. if it is a painless and freely movable lump it can be due to lymph node swelling which is commonly seen in case of near of distant infection in the body.2. if it is a diffused swelling which increase during eating it can be due to blocked duct of submandibular salivary gland.3. a swollen lymph node can be due to malignant changes in lymph nodes leading to formation of a lymphoma. i would suggest you to consult an oral pathologist if surgeon is not available and get evaluated. in case if it is due to blocked salivary duct removal of obstruction can help... in case it is a lymph node, and you do not have any ongoing or recent history of infection then a biopsy of the lymph node has to be done to confirm the diagnosis. hope this helps. regards."

"a have lumbar spinal stenosis , and the pain has recently started to refer into the groin and the right testicle . that can a do to mitigate the pain ? a have been recommended to have a 4 level lumbar laminectomy . will this likely be effective to stop the testicular pain ?",1,37797,"hello ! thank you for your question ! in my opinion the symptoms you describe may be probably related to the intervertebral discs in the lower part of the lumbar vertebral column of your husband. you say that he has been holding heavy lifting recently. this may have caused his intervertebral discs to displace and compress the spinal nerves that are responsible for his lower limbs. the numbness and the pain in the groin area are not related to physical exercise. they must be related to a herniated disc. so i would highly recommend you bring your husband to the doctor and have e good physical examination and further exams for the vertebral column like spinal ct scan or mri . hope to have been helpful! best wishes,"

"i , a miscarried in early november last year . and went straight back on the pill had one break and a period came . now in on the pill with week to go and i have been experiencing brown discharge for 1 week now and i also noticed i have more saliva which was the first sign i noticed when i was last pregnant . is it possible in pregnant again ?",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"a have enema in my lower legs due to obesity . they have become dark , hard and scale with a built up of a oily dirty film . now can a remove the buildup and smooth my legs ? my legs are hard and scale from enema . now can a make them smooth and remove the build up of oil and dirt.thanks , want to wear shorts again",1,93197,"welcome to chat doctor, and thank you for asking the question. first i would like to say that scores on the mmp are indicative of personality traits and not disorder. scoring high on certain scales indicates that you have increased traits corresponding to that scale, but it does not mean that you have suffering from that disorder. to make the diagnosis you need to consult the psychiatrist. now the scores: (as you have not mentioned the scale names, i am considering the scale number according to the total code by welsh.) scale 4- the psychopathic deviate scale. - high scores indicate that you have absence of deep emotional response. such individual have episodes of abnormal behavior but generally remain normal and lead a normal life. scale 7 - the psychasthenia scale - it indicates that you have phobias and compulsive behavior. the degree can vary from not disabling to disabling. if you can do your routine work nothing to worry. scale 8 - the schizophrenia scale-high scores do not diagnose schizophrenia so do not worry. schizophrenia is a complex disorder and need detailed assessment before commenting on it. anyway high scores only indicate that you may have unusual thoughts coming into your mind. again i will say high score does not mean that you have schizophrenia so do not worry. scale 9 - the hypomania scale-high scores indicate that you have overproduction of thoughts and actions. in my opinion if you are having trouble with some features of the scales you need counselling and behavior therapy to modify the troubling behavior. i hope you find this helpfulregards."

what is the prognosis of bipolar depression when detected in a young individual say at 2o yrs . ? whether the individual can focus on study during treatment ? that are the chances of relapse while on treatment ? any latest major brakthru for this disease as far as treatment is concerned ?,1,57839,"hi, thanks for writing in. it is important to know what tumor your relative is having and the stage of cancer. most testicular tumors are of a group known as seminole and this is the most widely occurring tumor. seminole has a good cure rate if detected early and this shows good response to treatment in patients. there is another group of testicular tumors known as non seminomatous germ cell tumors and this group has many sub tumor types. they tend to be more aggressive than seminoles and invasion is common. the prognosis of non-seminomatous germ cell tumors is variable and depends on the biological behavior of individual tumors. prognosis can be inferred from tumor markers, location of the primary tumor and of course presence of metastases. treatment at any cancer research institute is recommended depending on his location. please do not worry."

(considering your period of 30 days). so the ovulation day falls on 8 feb. thus the fertile period would be from 3 february till 11 feb. if your period is different from 30 days, please add or subtract those many days in this calculation. according to your calculation, the fertile period starts on 2 feb. so the chances of pregnancy due to intercourse on 31 jan. are remote, though cannot be completely excluded, since variation by couple of days has to be expected. it is too close to the fertile period. though there was no ejaculation, you cannot exclude pre-ejaculation fluid passage which happens unknowingly. it does contain some sperms which are capable of fertilizing an ovum. so though the maximum chances of conception are due to sex on 2 feb., for legal purpose, you may opt for dna test to ascertain the paternity. i hope this helps you."

hello a was pregnant year before and had miscarriage now since 8 months have passed a not able to conceive so a going for checkups my doctor noticed cyst on my right ovary and also prescribed me to have nautrogest 300 or can you suggest how the tablet will help me to conceive,1,9011,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. since you have been pregnant before, there is no reason to expect that you should not be able to conceive spontaneously after going off the demo proverb. the fact that you terminated your pregnancies does not have any long term effects on your ability to conceive, and demo, once it is out of your system, does not have any bearing on your fertility or ability to have a healthy child. certainly there is no reason to delay trying to get pregnant if that is what you and your partner desire. however, sometimes it can take 6 months to even a year after stopping demo for your ovulation to return consistently, so if you do not conceive easily right away, there is no reason to be concerned. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful. best wishes,"
hello a was pregnant year before and had miscarriage now since 8 months have passed a not able to conceive so a going for checkups my doctor noticed cyst on my right ovary and also prescribed me to have nautrogest 300 or can you suggest how the tablet will help me to conceive,2,76346,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. fertomid is a type of fertility medication used help to cause ovulation in women who have trouble getting pregnant. because you did get pregnant (even though you had a miscarriage), unless you have been trying since then for over a year and been unable to conceive, the fatimid medication will not likely increase your chance of pregnancy significantly. therefore, even if you forgot to take some pills, you still have a significant chance of pregnancy as you are still very young, especially if you have regular menstrual cycles. if you and your husband have not been trying to conceive for more than a year on your own, i would not recommend using any fertility medication. using fatimid for more than four menstrual cycles can actually reduce your risk of pregnancy, as it decreases the effect of estrogen on your uterine lining. 80% of healthy couples will conceive within one year if they are having regular (at least 2 to 3 days per week) intercourse without contraception. one in 10 pregnancies will end in miscarriage, which means that 90% of the time couples will conceive a perfectly healthy pregnancy after a miscarriage without any form of medical treatment. so in summary, missing the fatimid tablets this particular month will not likely affect your chance of conceiving this cycle if you already ovulate naturally. i strongly recommend trying to get pregnant naturally for one year before using any type of fertility medication, as your body has proven that you can conceive even though that pregnancy did not work out. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this additional information was helpful. best wishes,"

"a have lower back pain along with pain in the lower section of the belly it gets worse when a a standing or walking , at first is very painful in the morning and then as i move it gets better this is going on for like two weeks sometimes the pain is very sharp , and also have feel like a need to go potty , can you help ?",1,48791,"hi, thank you for providing the brief history of you. a thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised. as your chief complaint is that when you walk there is a sharp pain in the lateral side of the left foot, i suspect it to be muscular pain or either neuropathic pain for which a thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised. also. when there is a nerve impingement in the lumbar spine, it all starts with the pain in most cases on the lateral side of the foot. as you even mentioned that you had a bony injury in the past, there might be a tendency of abnormal gait during that time and shortening of muscles of the spine due to walking in pain. as i feel, by strengthening the muscles of the core, spine, pelvic floor and lower limbs on both sides you should be able to walk. since the nerve impingement gives the initial symptoms as pain in the lateral side of the foot and progresses over a period of time. so before it gets more on future you can get an mri of lumbar spine and them proceed with physical therapy for the lumbar spine. in my clinical experience i see cases who initially comes with this sort of pain and later with nerve impingement diagnosis. so, from past couple of years i have noticed that this is the first alerting symptom of the neurological pain, so now i deal with first an mri of spine and core stability. results come on 3-4 weeks of time and post which in future complaints are less regards jay in chat doctor."

"a have an ark of moderate pain and what appears to be an arced bruise on the underside of my left big toe . 3-4 days ago a suddenly felt a sharp pain there and thought a saw a dark hairline black arc somewhere under my skin , but figured a was over reacting . a can walk on my one fine most of the day as long as a walk on it normally and done roll my toe or walk on the side of my foot/toe . in the middle and innermost end of the arc the arc seems to have points - almost ike a blood blister , but way under my skin . any way to know what this is ?",1,13930,"hello, and thank you for your question. fortunately, you probably do not have fibromyalgia. there are several possible causes of pain just in the toe. if there is a pinched nerve in the lower spine, it can cause pain that can be just in one toe. if this is the case, you may find that the pain is worse with change in position, such as lying flat or standing up. pain in the toe, typically the big toe, is common in a disorder called gout, in which the body has too much uric acid. the pain usually lasts a few days at a time, and is usually associated with redness and swelling. pain in the toes can be caused by corns or other skin problems that look small but feel very severe. pins and needles, shooting, on-and-off pains can be caused by irritation to a nerve by diabetes, by lack of vitamins such as b12, or by pressure - similar to the ""foot falling asleep"" feeling we sometimes get if we cross our legs too long. fibromyalgia, on the other hand, is usually a ""pain all over"" problem - back pain, neck pain, arm pain, knee pain, without another cause such as arthritis. it usually does not cause just one part of the body to hurt - most patients say that ""everything hurts"". in my practice, i start with finding out as much as i can from the patient about how the pain feels and how long it has been going on, and if it seems related to anything else. then we examine the foot to look for anything going on with the skin, check if the nerves of the foot are normally sensitive, not as sensitive as usual, or more sensitive, and then we may check blood tests to detect diabetes or vitamin deficiency or other problems as needed. fibromyalgia is diagnosed by obtaining a careful history of where the patient is having pain, other medical problems, and completing a physical exam including what is called a ""painful point"" exam where the doctor pushes at certain places in the body - on the back and near the joints - to see if this causes pain. i hope that my answer to your question is helpful. if you have any further questions, please check back with us. i hope your toe is much better soon."

so my sister was beaten and abused 4 years ago by her boyfriend and now apparently there damage to the uterus lining and the doctors say that there a small chance that shell be able to carry a child due to the fact that there only a 10 % chance that the egg will stick to her lining . is there something that can be done about this as she would like to eventually have a child with her current boyfriend .,1,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

by wife had a second mis-carriage in the 7th week after hearing the heartbeat .. and also there was a pregnancy delay of one week from lmp .. and this has been a silent miscarriage again.with no stomach cramps .. i also got my semen analysis done and found the_sperm_count_42 with motile sperm is 50 % .. with pus cells 8-10 % ... and it indicates pyospermia ... can_you_please_suggest_what_can_be_done ? ?,1,85262,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. there are two possibilities of what may be going on if you do not yet see a heartbeat with your pregnancy. the first, even though you are sure of your lmp, conception can take place at a different time in your cycle than you expected. the egg can live inside you up to 72 hours after ovulation, and sperm can remain alive inside you for up to 5 days. so you actually may have conceived a week later than you thought, which means that you are only 6 weeks pregnant. it can be normal to not see a heartbeat at 6 weeks. the other possibility is that the fetus died already at 6 weeks, which is a miscarriage that has not come out yet. the way we can figure out what is going on is to check another ultrasound in a week or so. if there is no heartbeat by 7 weeks, then the diagnosis of a miscarriage is correct. so i know it is hard to be patient, but there is nothing that can be done to prevent miscarriage. one of every 10 pregnancies are miscarriages, meaning 90 percent of the time after a miscarriage women go on to have a healthy baby. i hope i was able to answer your question and that this information was helpful to you. best wishes, and good luck with the pregnancy,"

"i , pm just wondering if aspirin can raise my white blood cell count ? pm 22 , female with a pain in my right lower side for the last 6 days , a have been to hospital where they did and ultrasound but couldn't locate my appendix.my wbc came back fine.i have to go back in today and a have been taking aspirin for pain.can this affect my tests ?",1,26797,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. low white blood cells (which are the disease-fighting cells in your body) can occur both as a result of a disease that lowers your white cell count (like hiv) or by consumption when your body is working hard to clear an infection. in your case, your doctors were concerned you had an infection in your body causing your white blood cells to fall. they found the infection in your kidneys and prescribed an antibiotic, which is it works, should clear the infection and your white cell count will return to normal. your white cell count and you're having a kidney infection does not affect the baby at all as long as you are treated properly and follow your doctors' advice. my only concern is that if you truly have a kidney infection, amoxicillin is not a particularly strong antibiotic for urinary tract infections. so if you have taken the medication for a few days, and you still have fever higher than 38.5 celsius, (101f) or bad flank pain occasionally iv antibiotics are needed for treatment. i hope my answer was helpful for you today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

a have all signs of pregnancy . a was one week late for my period . yesterday should have been the end of my period and a started to spot very light red blood . not enough for a pad . something happened today . would a still be pregnant even though a am spotting ?,1,1599,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the morning after pill is 90 percent effective if taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse. so, regardless of what happened with your pill taking before your pill-free week, the morning-after pill should still be effective. many women have a delayed period after taking the morning-after pill as a side effect, but the possibility of pregnancy still exists if you are late, so you should perform a urine pregnancy test just in case. if it has not been 2 weeks yet since your unprotected encounter, it may be too early to have a positive pregnancy test, so i would repeat it in a week if that is the case. in addition, many women have an irregular period or skip entirely after they stop the pill. if you are not pregnant, you can start a new pack of pills as soon as you get them, but just use a condom as a backup for the first two weeks. you should get a period in the pill-free week as you did previously. i hope i was able to answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"
a have all signs of pregnancy . a was one week late for my period . yesterday should have been the end of my period and a started to spot very light red blood . not enough for a pad . something happened today . would a still be pregnant even though a am spotting ?,2,8772,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the proper way to use the nearing is to put it in, leave it in for 3 weeks, take it out, wait one week, and replace it. during the week you are not wearing the ring, you should have some bleeding that is considered a menstrual cycle. if you wore the ring continuously for two months and then had a new one replaced but only removed it 3 days later, the pinkish spotting was your ""period"", which is caused by not wearing the ring. the bleeding was very light because you had suppressed it by continuously wearing the ring for over 2 months. so you should expect your next period about 4-5 weeks after the episode of spotting that you had. if you do not have menses by then, i recommend repeating the pregnancy test at that time. if you did not have regular monthly cycles before you used the ring, your cycle will follow your regular pattern that you typically have when not using hormonal contraception. if you are trying to get pregnant, you should have intercourse about every other day and begin taking prenatal vitamins as it benefits the health of the baby for the vitamins to be present at conception. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"hi , for the past few years i have noticed a lump on the back of my neck just below my hairline , in the middle . it is quite large . the last couple of months it has been hurting lot all the time overtime i move my neck in fact , it is now causing me headaches almost every 2nd 3rd day . an you please specify what it might be ?",1,82657,"hi, thank you for providing the brief history of you. since you mentioned the numbness and tingling, it can be assumed with almost 99% accuracy that it is radiculopathy. that means - the pain, tingling and numbness is travelling across the course of the nerve.recommended meeting an or tho and get the mri of neck and lower back to check the extent of injury in the spine. we can only find the disc prolapse, disc protrusion, or disc herniation on the mri scan. once the extent of injury is known the next step is taken depending upon the impact of pain. first - resting the neck and nanosecond - medication for pain, if pain is unbearablethird - physical therapy, as early as possible to be initiated for not allowing the muscle wasting and quick recovery. fourth - back to action. as you asked about acupuncture, it is not bad to try out, but it will only provide you a symptomatic relief. the real cause is the weakness in the spinal muscles and abdominal muscles. along with this the muscles of the neck region. the cause is the degenerative changes. it occurs due to wear and tear, or it may be an aging factor. with exercise 100% of my patients have recovered and back to action. so will be the case worldwide. in very few cases where the pain is unbearable they undergo surgery. well, it.is the last option to try out. also, recommend you to meet a physical therapist as he/she will help regain strength in the core, back, and neck. also, an overall body conditioning will help on a later stage. in few cases epidural injection is recommended but it's not a first line of action. as i said, it all depends upon the patient pain bearing factor. also, 99% of the best surgeon in orthopedic and spine specialty will prefer the physical therapy. as it helps sopwith the grace of god i wish you a good health. regards"

"hello ashley , a am trying to get a better understanding of when my conception date was to better explore my options at this time . a have no children and do not want children i have been on sep shot for the past 7 years my new doctor stated it has been to long and i could no longer receive the shot so she changed me to the pill and now in pregnant 2:51 pm i have not had a cycle in the last maybe 3 or 4 years just a little spotting here and there but not a full or partial cycle i last had sex on october 7 went to the doctor on october 10 for a refill of my birth control and showed no signs of pregnancy went to the doctor yesterday and was advised i was pregnant by urine and blood",1,49266,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. if you last had your period on september 12th, and today is october 5th, your period is not yet late for october. most women have a 25-35 day cycle, so until you actually miss your period for october, there is no reason to assume you are pregnant. the folic acid and zinc you are taking are just extra vitamins that provide health to a growing pregnancy; these should not affect or change your menstrual cycle or its symptoms. if your period is late in october, you should purchase and perform an over-the-counter pregnancy test. modern pregnancy tests are very accurate and can be positive even 10 days after conception. if you do find out you are pregnant, there is nothing that needs to be done immediately as pregnancy is not a disease- it is a normal state for women in the reproductive phase of their lives. so it is important only to keep taking your vitamins, get plenty of rest, eat a balanced diet and avoid alcohol, caffeine and chat doctor. if your period is mate, but you are not pregnant, the delay in your cycle can have a number of causes, including hormonal imbalances, certain medical conditions like thyroid disease, and even the stress of worrying about pregnancy. if you miss more than 2 months of your cycle (no bleeding for 3 months) and your pregnancy test is negative, you should see a physician for a hormonal evaluation. so in summary, a late menstrual cycle can be caused by pregnancy, but there are other causes as well. i suggest you perform a pregnancy test if you are late, and if it is negative, try to be patient, and you will likely get it before another month goes by. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

hi i am looking after my 9 month old grandson and he has just done his 24 hours with just water ( he got up yesterday morning with sickness and diarrhoea ) i know he must have dried toast for his first meal but how long till he can go back onto his milk ?,1,41885,"hi, the usual amount of sleep for an infant your grandsons age is 9-12 hours at night plus 2-4 hours of nap time. infant sleep behavior should be understood in the context of the relationship and interaction between infant and caregiver which impacts greatly on the quality and quantity of sleep. how long has your grandson had trouble with sleeping? temporary sleep disturbances that occur with acute illness usually are self-limited. certain factors are associated with chronic sleep problems such as inability to self-soothe, difficult temperament, maternal depression, and insecure maternal-infant attachment. how much is he crying? vomiting? does his diet consist of anything other than breast milk? what about babies environment? noisy? proper temperature? smoking? too bright? does he sleep in his own bed? if he is not feeding as well at the breast as he used to, he could be losing weight. should he be losing weight this is a situation that must be investigated immediately? i wish you were able to share more information with me. however, in the usa, one of the well baby office visits with his pediatrician is at four months of age. addendum: breast milk is not a good source of vitamin d. if he is not already taking this vitamin, he should have vitamin d daily. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"i doctor , we are planning for a baby & i ejaculate very quick & the size of my penis is around 4 inches after erection i would like to know what position we should do intercourse to have baby & is it of after i ejaculate to continue the intercourse or should i stop for the sperm to find its way to the egg if i continue does it effect the sperm which i ejaculate inside the vagina what are the other things i should do to have baby i know the golden period i am having a low sperm count problem swell my sperm count is around 10 million please help me asap",1,111986,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. in normal healthy couples, it can sometimes even take up to a year to conceive. 80% of couples will conceive within one year if having regular unprotected intercourse (at least 2 to 3 days per week). it is best not to time the efforts of intercourse around ovulation unless you have accurately documented the ovulation date, with an ovulation predictor kit or with hormone levels checked at the doctor's office. the best way to try to conceive in the beginning is to have sex every other day from the time your period finishes until you start to feel premenstrual symptoms. premenstrual symptoms are caused by the same hormones as produced by pregnancy, so when you start to feel bloating, breast tenderness, nausea, or other pregnancy symptoms you do not need to continue to try to conceive that cycle, as you either already ovulated or are already pregnant. there are nearly 6 million sperm in every ejaculate from a man, so as long as some sperm is ejaculated inside the vagina, there is a possibility of conceiving. many women have sperm leak out after intercourse, however the ability of sperm to swim within the vagina ensures that a man with a normal sperm count has at least thousands of sperm that reach the egg if ovulation has been taking place. so in summary, many couples do not conceive within two months of beginning to try. i encourage you and your husband to have patience. in the meantime, the best way to prepare for healthy pregnancy is to get adequate rest, eat a healthy diet, avoid alcohol consumption, and take a prenatal vitamin or folic acid supplement which can help prevent birth defects. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"i there i have a 7 month old little girl , i just went to the doctor cause i cant get immune to rubella he said it might be something else wrong in my body , my results from the blood test came in and it said my white blood cells are high and to have another blood test in a month to see if there gone back to normal . be said not to worry , should i worry ?",1,97284,"hi, i have gone through your query. the values you have mentioned are something different. ejection fraction is normally between 50% to 60%. as your doctor said that it is within normal limit then be it so. back pain, belching and increased pain on fatty food may be due to pancreatitis, as your ultrasound reports are normal. i would suggest you to go for blood amylase. if it is raised then it will confirm pancreatitis. mentioned symptoms are seen in inflammatory bowel disease, so colonoscopy may be required if all investigations came out to be normal. in the meantime avoid oily, junk food and alcohol. do consider positive feedback as a credit to my work. let me know if you have any further questions."

"i a was wondering , with a pet scan , should you be able to tell the difference between active scar tissue , and scar tissue from radiation treatment ( which ended approx.7 weeks ago ) ? also if a pet scan shows inflammation in the lymph nodes , but the lymph nodes appear normal how likely might it be that the inflammation is residual effects from the radiation , or rather that the cancer returned ?",1,4724,"hi, pet scan will certainly be able to differentiate between scar tissue and cancer. but the timing of pet scan is very, very important. after radiation therapy, it is ideal to wait for 12 weeks before radiation induced inflammation becomes normal. if fdg uptake occurs after 12 weeks from completion of radiation, it is not radiation induced inflammation. at 7 weeks, it becomes difficult to conclusively say if its cancer or radiation induced inflammation. but the dictum if radiation induced fdg uptake is usually diffuse and low to moderate grade. a focal area of uptake usually indicates another problem like cancer or infection. recurrent cancer is usually focal and intense, though it's not a dictum in all the cases."

a believe a pinched a nerve on my lower back that caused severe pain that shot through my leg for about 2 hours . this happened over two weeks ago and my right leg is still stiff and hard to walk on . by right foot is numb from the baby toe up to my ankle . is there anything a can do to stop the numbness is my foot ? also is there anything a can do to loosened the stiff right leg ? there is no more pain in my lower back . a believe a hurt myself at the gym the day before this happened .,1,13930,"hello, and thank you for your question. fortunately, you probably do not have fibromyalgia. there are several possible causes of pain just in the toe. if there is a pinched nerve in the lower spine, it can cause pain that can be just in one toe. if this is the case, you may find that the pain is worse with change in position, such as lying flat or standing up. pain in the toe, typically the big toe, is common in a disorder called gout, in which the body has too much uric acid. the pain usually lasts a few days at a time, and is usually associated with redness and swelling. pain in the toes can be caused by corns or other skin problems that look small but feel very severe. pins and needles, shooting, on-and-off pains can be caused by irritation to a nerve by diabetes, by lack of vitamins such as b12, or by pressure - similar to the ""foot falling asleep"" feeling we sometimes get if we cross our legs too long. fibromyalgia, on the other hand, is usually a ""pain all over"" problem - back pain, neck pain, arm pain, knee pain, without another cause such as arthritis. it usually does not cause just one part of the body to hurt - most patients say that ""everything hurts"". in my practice, i start with finding out as much as i can from the patient about how the pain feels and how long it has been going on, and if it seems related to anything else. then we examine the foot to look for anything going on with the skin, check if the nerves of the foot are normally sensitive, not as sensitive as usual, or more sensitive, and then we may check blood tests to detect diabetes or vitamin deficiency or other problems as needed. fibromyalgia is diagnosed by obtaining a careful history of where the patient is having pain, other medical problems, and completing a physical exam including what is called a ""painful point"" exam where the doctor pushes at certain places in the body - on the back and near the joints - to see if this causes pain. i hope that my answer to your question is helpful. if you have any further questions, please check back with us. i hope your toe is much better soon."

"i can you please give me some advice . a have several issues a have shari malformation plus degenerative disc disease in my neck and bone spurs between my c5 and c6 . the headaches and neck pain is so severe most days it a hard to function . a currently am in the throes of a violent headache . an you give options on what a can do to decrease the pain ( tried hot bath , cold and got compresses otc pain beds and of med of fioricet ) . this is day 4 of this .",1,2843,"hello, sorry to hear about the list of injuries you faced. coming to the point, you mentioned that mri is suggestive of lumbar and cervical disc degenerative changes. let's discuss this first and then the rest. what my experience taught me over a period of 12 years with cases related to injuries like you and others i will give my suggestion. first foremost, buy a soft neck collar and start using it. this will stabilize the bones of the cervical region and also will act as s support to the muscular system to allow less compression over the nerve. the disc injuries are most times self-healing, once the inflammation subsides you should not feel much pain. when using neck collar i will advise you to use on/off hot water fermentation so that the muscled which have undergone spasm will relax, and the pain will come down slowly. along with this. you have lumbar disc degenerative changes, so why don't you first take hot water fermentation so that the muscles of the lumbar region gets relaxed and make you at least stable. post this use 3-4 pillows and try mckenzie maneuver in passive way. the details of mckenzie you can find over the net. this will help centralize the pain and once the pain is centralized you can use hot water bag to again soothe the nerve roots. once nerve root is relaxed the pain travelling in its course will reduce automatically. post which after 5-7 days of doing this you can focus on exercises, but please continue the above advice as well. exercise should focus on core stability, lower limb strengthening, upper limb strengthening and neck muscle strengthening. slowly you will develop strength also and the inflammation on the nerve root will be reduced leading to the end result of improved lifestyle. if your pain symptoms are too high then a nerve block may be administered to the nerve root which may block the pain sensation for a couple of months. but if the muscles remain week still, it will again come back so doing the above-mentioned exercise will be of help to avoid recurrence of pain symptoms. coming to the surgical management, there is possibility of removal of the torn disc element and also fusing the spine, but this may not make you get rid of the pain over all for long. the pain will be present throughout the life and need exercise for the same. this option i do not recommend unless and until the motor functions are compromised. also, very important is the diet, what you eat is to be focused. having food which can digest faster without leading to any gastritis should be kept in mind. as with gastritis there may be leading to two symptoms, one compression over the nerve in the lower spine and headache. having a good diet plan will be good. please do not ignore the hip and knee muscles as you have the replacement done in the past and the muscles are weak this may aggravate the spine curvature to deviate and lead to other symptoms. coming to your ankle, i cannot comment much as the history is too brief to guide over anything. i am sorry for it. please contact a local physical therapist who can show interest in you and give the maximum output. i have tried my best to put forth the best possible treatment plan which should help you. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further. jay in chat doctor."

pm having a lot of lower abdominal pressure and pressure in my rear .. that is very uncomfortable ... few days ago a was involved in car accident was rear ended . a went to the of and they did a of can with blue dye .. but they said everything was of but a still have that pain is that normal ? ? .,1,69544,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the most likely explanation for the bumps in your anal area that you have noticed recently, is the development of external hemorrhoids. hemorrhoids are veins in and around the anus that become dilated from the pressure of your uterus and the babies head pushing downwards, especially when you try to move your bowels. the white bumps that you see are most likely hemorrhoids that have not become swollen with blood. the blue one that you see, more likely is closer to the surface, where the blood can be visible through the wall of the vein. as long as your anus does not itch, or that you don't have any bleeding from the area, there is nothing danger about hemorrhoids. they will generally resolve after delivery. i would ask your obstetrician to take a look at them the next time you have an appointment. in the meantime, taking site baths, which is soaking your rear end in a warm top filled with about 6 inches of water for 20 to 30 minutes, can decrease the swelling. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy, and i hope you feel better,"

"by period was late this month . a had cramping on one side of my lower abdomen for a few hours , on and off . water , a started bleeding . a haven bled enough to fill a panty liner , maybe one or two spots , first brown coloured and then bright red . is there anything else that could cause that besides pregnancy ? a took a pregnancy test before the bleeding and it said negative .",1,73325,"hallow dear, i have gone through your history. i feel there is some confusion in calculating the days of ovulation and fertile period. ovulation takes place 14 days prior to next expected menses. the egg has life of 24 hours while the sperms are active for 72 hours. hence, the fertile period is a period of one week around the days of ovulation. since the ovulation takes place 14 days prior to next menstrual period, your bout of bleeding cannot be 10 days after ovulation and two weeks before expected date of period. this statement suggests that you are having some misunderstanding about ovulation day and fertile period. whether it was an implantation bleeding or it was mittelschmerz (ovulation bleeding) can be decided only on confirmation of the pregnancy. you may take pregnancy test on the overnight first morning urine sample 8-10 days after missed period; done earlier these tests may give false negative results. alternatively you may opt for beta chat doctor test which is very sensitive and can give you reliable results even few days before missing period. since you had considerable bout of bleeding, i would advise you to go for ultrasonography after 10 days of missed period (in case pregnancy test is positive) to assess the safety of the baby. it will inform you whether the bout of bleeding has disturbed the pregnancy or not. this will resolve your dilemma."

"by husband had a vasectomy 4 years ago for the past 2 weeks a have had pregnancy symptoms including urinating a lot , tender and enlarged breasts , feeling nauseous and now my period is 2 days late . a took a test last week it was negative . a have a slight white discharge . would a be pregnant ?",1,49266,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. if you last had your period on september 12th, and today is october 5th, your period is not yet late for october. most women have a 25-35 day cycle, so until you actually miss your period for october, there is no reason to assume you are pregnant. the folic acid and zinc you are taking are just extra vitamins that provide health to a growing pregnancy; these should not affect or change your menstrual cycle or its symptoms. if your period is late in october, you should purchase and perform an over-the-counter pregnancy test. modern pregnancy tests are very accurate and can be positive even 10 days after conception. if you do find out you are pregnant, there is nothing that needs to be done immediately as pregnancy is not a disease- it is a normal state for women in the reproductive phase of their lives. so it is important only to keep taking your vitamins, get plenty of rest, eat a balanced diet and avoid alcohol, caffeine and chat doctor. if your period is mate, but you are not pregnant, the delay in your cycle can have a number of causes, including hormonal imbalances, certain medical conditions like thyroid disease, and even the stress of worrying about pregnancy. if you miss more than 2 months of your cycle (no bleeding for 3 months) and your pregnancy test is negative, you should see a physician for a hormonal evaluation. so in summary, a late menstrual cycle can be caused by pregnancy, but there are other causes as well. i suggest you perform a pregnancy test if you are late, and if it is negative, try to be patient, and you will likely get it before another month goes by. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

help a pulled my daughters loose baby tooth the tooth was almost straight when she pushed it with her lounge and it came out easy enough but there was a bit of blood and the tooth was hollow and there is a slightly hard dangling piece of either tooth or root in the gum did a do something bad and should a take her to the dentist in the morning she had a bit of a headache after and she said it was hurting thank you,1,44715,"hello, i can understand your concern. it would have been helpful if you had mentioned which tooth was treated for root canal. as you are mentioning that the tooth was black and had cracks in it, i am assuming that the tooth is in the lower front region, and you had had some trauma to the lower jaw area which made the tooth dead and also hurt the chin and lip. other possibility is that if the tooth was dead for many years, it may have developed a periapical cyst in relation with the tooth which might be pressing on the mental nerve supplying lower lip and chin and may cause numbness of those areas. alternatively, the numbness may have started after taking local anesthesia in the lower front area for some tooth problem and the injection might have been given deep. in any case, it seems that the nerve supplying sensation to the lower front area of jaw along with lower lip and chin (mental nerve) is damaged. usually, if the nerve is damaged, it can regenerate in 3-6 months and the sensations can return. if you are not sure regarding the crown on the tooth, you can avoid it for some months and take care not to bite hard things with that tooth so that it does not fracture. you can get the crown after the numbness is solved. i would also advise you to visit an oral and maxillofacial surgeon for the examination of the area and regarding numbness. he/she might take an x-ray to rule out presence of periapical lesion or cyst in relation with the tooth. crown should surely be postponed until this possibility is ruled out. i hope this information helps you. thank you for choosing chat doctor. i wish you feel better soon. best,"

a had unprotected sex so the day after i took a admin contraceptive pills . pm on the last 4 tablets now . a think to stop taking it cause my urinary track infection become active since i started taking the pills.i also had a sore between my anus and vagina and its real give me hard time . i done do any sexual intercourse after for almost 3 weeks now . is there any possibility to get pregnant if i stop taking the pills .,1,33341,"hi, if you came to my clinic with those complaints i would ask you to stop worrying. many women that start using the pills for the first time experience similar problems. i understand that you have taken the inactive pills first and then started on the active pills. also, you have had intercourse only after your period was over that is about 11 days ago. the chances of pregnancy occurring after a single act of unprotected sexual intercourse are only 4%. also, for women that have regular periods the chance of getting pregnant is more if intercourse occurs after 11-12 days since the first day of the period. hence, the chances of getting pregnant are low if you have had contact before this period. you are also having a sick feeling in the stomach and most probably a cramp like feeling. this may be due to the pills as some females take time to get adjusted and may improve with continuous use and by taking the pills with food. the pills are not known to cause any major effect on the baby if they are inadvertently taken in early pregnancy. since you have started taking the active pills late, i would recommend that you use a backup contraceptive measure like condoms, for the next 7 days while you still take the pills to avoid pregnancy. i would be pleased to answer any further queries that you may have, enjoy a wonderful day."

"a have lot of rashes in the neck and sides of the cheek , and jawline . its been like this for over 6 weeks . a visited the dermatologist and was given a acne moist cream and some medicine to take in the night named as xylene . but this treatment didst work and a have the same condition .",1,75438,"hi, thanks for writing in. singles infection is caused by the chicken pox virus reactivation at the dorsal ganglion of spinal nerves. this condition is usually seen in immunologically weak and in elderly. as your mother is taking chemotherapy and is also elderly, this reactivation of the chicken pox virus has taken place with a higher magnitude. patients with suspected shingles have to be given a course of antiviral medicine like acyclovir or val acyclovir within 72 hours of first appearance of rashes. if not given then the rashes take a longer time and the patient is in more pain and discomfort. if the rashes are not responding to acyclovir or val acyclovir then it might be resistant to treatment and this has to be followed up with other medicines. though the rashes usually fall off in a week in most patients, it is difficult to predict the course of this illness in a patient having lymphoma and in elderly age group. some patients also require treatment with iv medications and this can reduce the flaring of symptoms. shingles pain and discomfort might persist for up to 6 months and there is herpes neuralgia in which the patient might have burning symptoms for a long time. this is treated with powerful pain relievers."

i was planning to apply to middle east and did a medical test for the same.found that sgpt count is 77 in place of desired 41.i have a history of gilberts syndrome.how bad is it ? should i be worried about my liver condition.is there a way i can reduce the count in a short time to qualify for the medical test,1,58987,"his am chat doctor. i have read your message. i think i can help you. first, a package test means that multiple tests are included that correlate to the test. cpk and spe can both be package tests as there are many related tests needed in a diagnosis. the symptoms that you seem to be facing as per the query is basically severe backache that increases on lying down or bending-in other words, anything that causes the spine to be under pressure. now she itself can cause the symptoms. the muscles and bone problems can arise in she itself and thus possibly one will feel that there is nothing more to do. however, in many situations, the doctors may get biased my a diagnosis. so, i think it is good that your doctor did not get biased with your pre-existing diagnosis of she and continued to look for other causes of backache. a severe backache can happen due to muscle disorders, a condition known as myopathy. the cause of myopathy may be she itself. the test commonly done to test myopathy is cpk or creatine phospholipase. this is a test done from blood. the idea is if the cpk is raised, it suggests myopathy. in this situation, your doctor will need to modify the therapy. i am unaware of your medication from the query. so i cannot really comment upon it. but some medicines themselves cause myopathy. and sometimes, the dose of existing medicines need to be stepped up for treatment of myopathy. so i presume your doctor wanted to check that. second test was spe or serum protein electrophoresis. this is one of the tests for multiple myeloma. this is a type of malignancy that affects the bones and causes bone pains and should be ruled out in middle-aged to elderly commonly if the backache is worsening and is specially bad when lying down. if the test is negative, there is nothing to worry about. if it does come out to be positive, multiple myeloma can be treated. so again you need not worry since the treatment is available. why the doctor did not tell you about the tests is something i can only speculate about. i guess it was because these are just doubts, considering you already have she- in medicine, the usual dictum is that one disease can explain the symptom, the other condition should not be sought. having said that, it's a folly to miss another diagnosis due to a pre-existing condition. i think he would have told you if the tests came out positive. so there should be nothing to worry about-the doctor was just making sure that there is no other problem. possibly since there was nothing else diagnosed, he did not tell you about it. i have tried to make it as simple as possible to understand the situation. in case there are still doubts, feel free to contact me for further details. best of luck,"

"it 74 years my mother has been diagnosed with central core disease , she has been on stations , blood pressure and drinks minimum two bottles of champagne a day also she has osteoporosis and liver disease , because of the late onset of this disease does this mean it is hereditary",1,101537,"hi, thanks for writing in to us. hepatitis is of many types, the commonest being a, b and c. type a hepatitis is a self limited acute infection and total recovery occurs in most patients. type b hepatitis is an acute and/ or chronic infection and can persist in blood for many years to cause chronic liver disease. type c hepatitis is also a chronic disease and may cause severe liver disease after a long time. research has been done on cannabis in liver disorders:frequent use of cannabis has been shown to contribute to liver damage. as well as this, research has shown that the use of cannabis may suppress immune function and enhance the development of disease. with this in mind, avoiding frequent use of cannabis is advised. people who have hepatitis c and use cannabis every day are more likely to have severe fibrosis which can than lead to cirrhosis of the liver. if you have been diagnosed with hepatitis c, you may have heard that occasional or light use of cannabis has been shown to help some people deal with treatments and side effects. however, if you are considering using cannabis during treatment you should also be aware that it may do more harm than good and discuss it with your specialist. hope this helps"

"a ended up having sex the last day of my period which was 2 weeks ago . a was wondering if it would be possible to get pregnant then , and if so when would a have to test . by cycles are very irregular so a a not sure how long until a ovulate again . a a having some symptoms but not too sure if its my period showing up again or just in my head . any help is appreciated .",1,108096,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. it is true that theoretically you should have been clear of the injection within three months of discontinuation, however many women after being a depo-provera for a long time do not resume having ovulatory, regular, menstrual cycles until 6 to 9 months or even up to a year after discontinuation. unfortunately, it is difficult to artificially induce ovulation in women who are coming off depo-provera. if you were not trying to become pregnant, your cycle could be regulated temporarily with birth control pills, but if you're actually trying to get pregnant the best thing you can do with this point is to just keep trying and wait and see. if you feel any symptoms of pregnancy, and you haven't gotten your period for a while, i would do pregnancy test just to make sure. there is always a possibility even if your periods are not regular that you do ovulate sometimes. so in summary, continue having unprotected sex every other to every three days and give it some more time. 80% of couples will conceive within one year, and if after a year of trying you and your partner are unsuccessful, it might be a good idea to see a fertility specialist for an evaluation. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes, and good luck getting pregnant,"

a have an 18 month old daughter who has had 6 abscesses in the past 9 months they have progressively been getting larger she has one now that is being treated but the last one was the size of a goofball and put her in the hospital on is and required surgery are their any conditions you can think of that may be causing this .,1,78347,"hello, i can understand your concern and think of two possibilities for the grayish line you have described on the front teeth. firstly, if you took iron supplements during pregnancy or after childbirth, it may have entered the children bloodstream in uterus or through breast milk. the front teeth are developing in the uterus and matures in bone during initial months after birth, which may cause development of such lines. however, if this was the case, the line should have been present when the tooth erupted into oral cavity. as she has history of falling, it is quite a possibility that she may have damaged her front teeth. the teeth may not break or crack, but the pulp inside the tooth may have died making the tooth appear dark. invariably, this pulp would be infected and should be treated as the tooth is going to stay in oral cavity till your daughter ages 8-9 years. if this is the case, then she might need to go for lumpectomy procedure for the affected teeth. one more possibility is presence of plaque on the teeth due to inadequate oral hygiene and lack of proper tooth brushing. this can be removed by ultrasonic scaling procedure performed by the dentist in any case, i would recommend you to visit a dentist for examination of the line as confirmed diagnosis can be made only after physically looking at the teeth and the line you have described. if it is developmental, then no treatment is needed, and it will be gone with the milk tooth shedding. in case of any other reason, treatment will be required as described. i hope this information helps you. thank you for choosing chat doctor. take care. best,"

"be just took our dog a bath , it seriously does to want to take a bath so it screams so loud , it also jumps like crazy . water on a saw something in my legs , its a light scratch from that dog . be a vaccinated once for anti rabies . to a need to go to the doctor ? or have a been infected of the rabies ?",1,79223,"hi & welcome. i can understand your concern for your beloved mother. since, at the time of bite your dog was not vaccinated so there's a possibility of being infected with rabies. dogs uniformly begin to sicken and die within 10 days of spread of rabies virus from the cns to the salivary glands. that's why a healthy domestic dog that bites a person should be confined and observed for 10 days. dogs that exhibit any sign of illness should be evaluated by a veterinarian and reported to the local health department. if your dog does develop any signs of illness, it should be euthanized and its head shipped under refrigeration to a laboratory certified to perform rabies testing (most often a public health laboratory). if your dog remains healthy for the full 10 days, then it did not have rabies virus in its saliva at the time of exposure. besides, your mother should be given 4 doses (injections) of anti rabies vaccine on day 0, 3, 7, & 14. if the dog remains healthy after 10 days, the fourth dose of 14 days need not be given. hope this answers your query."
