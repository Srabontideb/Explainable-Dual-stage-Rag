i have a white paste like substance on the head of my penis . a pulled my finger across the head and it almost looked as if a layer of skin was peeling it off . a am circumcised but when a pulled the skin down all the way a could see it was in there as well . that is this ?,1,92266,"hi, thanks for writing in. at a young age everyone come across the situation you are having, and it is normal. the foreskin of penis slides forwards in the flaccid state and retracts back when you have an erection. this is because the erections are harder as the penis is more muscular due to testosterone effects. if it is causing any infection or swelling then you must consult the urologist. there will be no sexual problems if the foreskin is pulled back during erection and covers the head of the penis when flaccid. this is normal situation and nothing wrong with it."

"a ended my period two weeks ago , and started spotting about a week ago . after a day or two , the spotting turned into what a normal period would be for me , and seems to be ending now , two weeks after a finished my normal period . a a on the pill , and my periods have been consistent until now . also , a be been having pretty bad tension-like ( a think ) headaches that begin in the afternoon around 4-6 and get worse as the night progresses . a a wondering if these are related , as a am going through a very stressful time right now , or if it could be something else .",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

that is the best birth control pill to take ? a am will be starting birth control soon and am wondering from personal experience what is the best birth control pill to take ? a have heard there are issues with women gaining weight or breaking out while on birth control and a done want these issues . are there any birth control pills that you can recommend that wouldn't cause one to break out or gain weight ? or any that are non to help a person lose weight ? thanks in advance .,1,103484,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, the cramping and pain you are experiencing with urination are most likely symptoms of a urinary tract infection or uti. otis have nothing to do with your method of birth control, and can potentially spread to your kidneys, so you should have an evaluation with your local physician to make sure you do not have a bladder infection. regarding weight gain and its relationship to taking birth control, modern low-dose pills in general have been shown to not cause weight gain across the general population. if you have been on the pill for longer than three months, it wouldn't be unreasonable for you to see your women's healthcare provider and see if an alternate brand of pill might agree with you better, but there are usually other reasons in addition to the pill why someone would gain that much weight in a short period of time. so in summary, you're burning and pain with urination has nothing to do with your birth control or your gaining weight. you should see your local physician or healthcare provider to have your urine checked to make sure you do not have an infection and if you do, to get appropriate treatment. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

(as you said he has difficulty in walking now). you can also say to his parents that --- they can continue with all religious customs along with medicines, may be then they will agree... with medicine, he will start showing improvement in few days only... it is psychosis and patients will not agree to go to any doctor willingly, so you might need to take him forcefully. this is well accepted as it is for his benefit only. even if he doesn't agree for oral medicine there are injectables which are given to such patients... take the right step, take him to a doctor. hope the reply is useful feel free to ask more questions"

by husband was diagnosed with prostate cancer six years ago and now has pain from his bones where it has spread into his hips and pelvis . a would like to know whether this is the beginning of the end or whether he could still live for several years to come,3,5684,"one thing that you have not mentioned is whether you have gotten a ct scan or mri of the abdomen and a bone scan. the mri/ct will tell us whether the disease has spread out of the prostate or not and the bone scan will tell us if it has spread to the bones. a chest x-ray should also have been done to rule out spread to the lungs. if the disease is confined to the prostate and has not spread anywhere then a removal of the prostate by a cancer surgeon is advisable as the chances of cure with this surgery near 90%. however, that will put an end to his sex life as you already know. if he is absolutely adamant not to undergo surgery, then the only option available is radiotherapy plus hormone therapy. these have their own set of side effects and may decrease the libido. however, it will not make him irreversibly impotent. the downside is that the cure rates will fall and there is a chance that the disease may actually progress and spread to other organs. so, in a nutshell i will advise you to motivate him for the surgery else he runs the risk of putting an early end to his life. in case the disease has already spread to other organs, then the only option is hormone therapy."

"hi my 12years old son is addicted to eggs and chocolate milk and obsessed with clouds , planes and they take most of their concentration . be doesn't bite even after several attempts to his dentist yet he never bite or eat other stuff normal kids do .i was wolof he is autistic and they put him on strategy than adhd . my son also has learning disabilities .he is normal looking boy , very talented",1,108512,"! i really appreciate the effort you are putting priya, and thank you for thinking out of box of your family. your cousin, lax mi ram is having a kind of psychotic disorder (from what information you have provided in query) and because of that he thinks and believes that people are against him, want to kill him, and doesn't trust anyone. because he is suspicious of his family members -- he doesn't eat what they give him, resulting in poor food intake and weakness. i would sincerely advise you to take him to a psychiatrist, even if you have to fight with his family (they will definitely realize their mistake when they will see his improvement). from what you have described, i think his condition is deteriorating fast, and he needs urgent medical attention. (as you said he has difficulty in walking now). you can also say to his parents that --- they can continue with all religious customs along with medicines, may be then they will agree... with medicine, he will start showing improvement in few days only... it is psychosis and patients will not agree to go to any doctor willingly, so you might need to take him forcefully. this is well accepted as it is for his benefit only. even if he doesn't agree for oral medicine there are injectables which are given to such patients... take the right step, take him to a doctor. hope the reply is useful feel free to ask more questions"

(we call this osmosis phenomenon). for this effect, we need to check the blood sugar at midnight around 2am or so. if this midnight glucose level is very low, then we have to decrease your night insulin levels. therefore, the best for you is to go immediately to your treating doctor and adjust the insulin dose you are taking. regards"

by 8 year old just showed me a lump in is upper groin where is leg meets his trunk . be says he feels fine and he figured he must have banged it playing hockey this morning but cant remember doing so . should a be concerned or do you think it is a swollen gland ?,2,14812,"as per your explanation i understand there are two issues. first is left leg imbalance and not able to give weight in it. second is high blood sugar. for sugar patient it is common when ever there is some things wring in body along with inflammation the first thing is sugar level goes up. but it can also be normally without any cause so first thing you need to do is maintain his diet and blood sugar level through insulin or which ever way possible. if needed to visit your planetologist for further treatment. next you have mention he is not able to balance or give weight on one of his leg. but you have not mentioned what exactly happens when he gives weight on leg. is it due to pain or loss of control. let's assume if its pain. now pain in leg can be due to some injury where he might have hit his leg some were and he don't remember, or it can be due to reduce blood circulation also. here i suggest patient need to visit an orthopedic doctor and go ahead with proper examination and evaluation and plan treatment as per that. if there is too much pain at leg then patient can use hot pack as well apply a crew bandage to stabilize the soft tissue. this will help for getting some pain relief but remember this will not cure the pain. so do visit doctor as early as possible. if its loss of control then also you need to evaluate it properly why it's happening. it may be possible due to age also. but further evaluation as well conformation can be done only on examination, so i suggest to check with doctor again for this. i am sure this will be useful for you if you follow the given advice properly. take care."

"dear sir/madammy name is sean and 31 year old . my period is irregular , and some say that if your period is irregular then you must be infertility case . after that i counsel a doctor to check and finally doctor say that you are problem with b/l tubal blocked . now what i have to do . i am very fear to operation . is their any suggestion without operation . plus help me , what can i do for the best and early child birth .",1,36900,"hi, i guess your concern is wife not getting pregnant after 2 yrs of marriage, right? i got the picture what you are going through. don't worry i am here to help you sir. let's start discussing with the information you have shared with us. when you were a kid you got operated at penis. then heard the doctor saying you may not become a father. but sir what kind of operation it is? you haven't shared, or you may not be knowing as you were kid at that time. so cant say whether that operation is causing this problem. anyway let's keep this kid operation aside. you haven't shared how old is your wife? what her exact age is? is it a late marriage. if it's a late marriage then getting pregnant takes some time sir. have patience. women from 18-40 years of reproductive age group, the chances of pregnancy are high, after 50 years, chances of pregnancy are very less, and 42-45-transition zone, chances are not as high as reproductive age neither as less than after 50 years. you have to judge where wife stands, where? i would like to focus on the medical term-fertile period. it is from 10th-16th day of menses cycle where chances of becoming pregnant are very, very high. here sperm fertilizes ovum and women become pregnant, that's why it's called fertile period. well, with above discussion you can try out my suggestions:1. have patience, things will settle down slowly.2. i insist you and your wife to do sex in fertile period (mechanism i have told above). do this for next 6-8 months. you will get results by this time.3. if you are in a hurry, or you want to really know is that your kid operation is hindering you from becoming father, you can visit your nearby gynecologist or infertility specialist for sorting of things. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

last week a was started on a combination birth control pill to stop bleeding that has been ongoing since my iud was placed in december . to the 1st day a was told to take 4 pills then 2 them 2 then 1 . the first day a took the four the next day a took 3 and then a developed gallstones which a never had . a a healthy but just had my 3 re child he is 5 months . to yes a a a bit overweight but otherwise healthy so a went to a surgeon today for consult on gallbladder removal upon assessment the doc asked if a had thyroid issues and recommended a get an ultrasound in the near future . by question do you think the possible thyroid issue and the extra oestrogen could have contributed to the stone formation and that a should correct those things riser before totally removing my gallbladder ? ?,1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"hello of name of martha . a just found out about two weeks ago that a was pregnant . the due date givin of of of the womens connection center was november first . a dont think of that far along yet a was of the depo for two years a got off of december of 08 and didnt get a period till october of 09 . of question of a went of the rest room a few hours ago and had a brownish discharge , should a of of the of of wait ?",1,46547,"helloyour query is appreciated. the chances of pregnancy here depend on a lot of things. if intercourse occurred between the 10th and 20th days of the menstrual cycle, then chances of pregnancy are high. for e.g., if the female had her period on 1st november, and you had intercourse between 10th and 20th of november, the chances of getting pregnant are very higchatdoctorpared to other days. also, pill was taken immediately after unprotected intercourse, hence you have already done your best to prevent pregnancy. nothing further can be done right now to prevent pregnancy. you will have to wait till the date of her next menstrual period, in order to confirm whether she has conceived inspire of the pill. if she does cross the date of her expected periods, kindly perform a urine pregnancy test to rule out a pregnancy. however, with one random encounter of unprotected intercourse, plus the timely intake of pill, in my personal opinion, the chances of pregnancy are very low. and you definitely can do nothing about it now, apart from the pill, which you have already taken. hence, you should relax and wait for her period. meanwhile, ensure that further such episodes of unprotected intercourse are avoided. hope this helped you."

"hello , for about 1 week now live been having sharp pain in my lower back but on the sides , feel a little bloated but crappy as well . 2 weeks ago i had unprotected sex but the next morning i took the morning after pill , shortly after that is when the pain started . what might be the cause ?",1,1599,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the morning after pill is 90 percent effective if taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse. so, regardless of what happened with your pill taking before your pill-free week, the morning-after pill should still be effective. many women have a delayed period after taking the morning-after pill as a side effect, but the possibility of pregnancy still exists if you are late, so you should perform a urine pregnancy test just in case. if it has not been 2 weeks yet since your unprotected encounter, it may be too early to have a positive pregnancy test, so i would repeat it in a week if that is the case. in addition, many women have an irregular period or skip entirely after they stop the pill. if you are not pregnant, you can start a new pack of pills as soon as you get them, but just use a condom as a backup for the first two weeks. you should get a period in the pill-free week as you did previously. i hope i was able to answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"for the past three years i have been feeling persistent pain in lower right abdomen later combined with middle back pains , i visited a dr. suggested appendicitis later ulcers medication but to no any change its almost two years now without taking any medication just succumbing to the pain . please dr. advise me i cant just take the pain anymore.please .",1,91001,"hi, thank you for providing the brief history of you. a thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised. as mentioned you had undergone the tkr almost a year back, did you perform any physical exercises to get the optimum results of the post tkr? usually all joint replacement surgeries are successful, but the post tkr rehabilitation is not followed properly and later stages there are issues. also, since you mentioned you have pain in the calf muscle, and you cannot apply weight, first thing to do is to take an x-ray of knee and see if the prosthesis is intact. as in 99% of cases they are intact. performing clinical test like - slr will help guide further. as you already have a tkr, there will be a change in the gait mechanism and the abnormality in the spine due to abnormal weight-bearing on either side. like if you had tkr on right then the left has more load and vice versa. now tkr was performed due to pain in knee joint due to osteoarthritis and reduced joint space. so it can be possible you have the oa knee from at least 5 years ? these 5 years have changes the biomechanics of the weight-bearing joints and may be tilting of the pelvic. now to not go much deeper into the technical aspect of the situation, i will advise you to take an mri of the lumbar spine to see any soft tissue abnormality. if the test comes positive the treatment will be guided for the same - rest, medication and physical therapy. so mention little brief here - that there is change in the anatomy of the spine due to oa knee and the symptoms arise before or after surgery. this is my personal clinical experience with patients. so when tkr is performed in our clinical practice we strengthen not only the muscles of the knee but also the core, spine, pelvic floor and whole lower limbs on each side. as we believe in our clinic that body functions as a single unit and disturbance in the unit may lead to symptoms at later stages. our tkr cases in clinical setting are 100% success without any aches and pains for years. i recommend you to undergo an mri of the lumbar spine and undergo physical therapy later. i am sure you will be 100% fit and back to life. regardsjay in chat doctor."

by niece has been in the hospital a lot for vomiting out of control for days not holding anything down . they have ran so danny test and came up with nothing . the is thin and has no other issues so a am trying to check and see if there is anything a can find about it .,2,58987,"his am chat doctor. i have read your message. i think i can help you. first, a package test means that multiple tests are included that correlate to the test. cpk and spe can both be package tests as there are many related tests needed in a diagnosis. the symptoms that you seem to be facing as per the query is basically severe backache that increases on lying down or bending-in other words, anything that causes the spine to be under pressure. now she itself can cause the symptoms. the muscles and bone problems can arise in she itself and thus possibly one will feel that there is nothing more to do. however, in many situations, the doctors may get biased my a diagnosis. so, i think it is good that your doctor did not get biased with your pre-existing diagnosis of she and continued to look for other causes of backache. a severe backache can happen due to muscle disorders, a condition known as myopathy. the cause of myopathy may be she itself. the test commonly done to test myopathy is cpk or creatine phospholipase. this is a test done from blood. the idea is if the cpk is raised, it suggests myopathy. in this situation, your doctor will need to modify the therapy. i am unaware of your medication from the query. so i cannot really comment upon it. but some medicines themselves cause myopathy. and sometimes, the dose of existing medicines need to be stepped up for treatment of myopathy. so i presume your doctor wanted to check that. second test was spe or serum protein electrophoresis. this is one of the tests for multiple myeloma. this is a type of malignancy that affects the bones and causes bone pains and should be ruled out in middle-aged to elderly commonly if the backache is worsening and is specially bad when lying down. if the test is negative, there is nothing to worry about. if it does come out to be positive, multiple myeloma can be treated. so again you need not worry since the treatment is available. why the doctor did not tell you about the tests is something i can only speculate about. i guess it was because these are just doubts, considering you already have she- in medicine, the usual dictum is that one disease can explain the symptom, the other condition should not be sought. having said that, it's a folly to miss another diagnosis due to a pre-existing condition. i think he would have told you if the tests came out positive. so there should be nothing to worry about-the doctor was just making sure that there is no other problem. possibly since there was nothing else diagnosed, he did not tell you about it. i have tried to make it as simple as possible to understand the situation. in case there are still doubts, feel free to contact me for further details. best of luck,"

(your is six)you remember that what important is strength and not the length! entry and to and fro continuous movements are adequate. it is men technique, not his penis size that characterizes the lover in him. avoid these unrealistic expectations and be happy. i hope this will help you. if you have any further questions i will be happy to help. wish you good health."

"a was sick with bronchitis for about 12 days then around the 15th day a started to have pain in my ribs on the right side below my breast . the pain has only gotten worse in the last 6 days . it hurts when a breath , cough or even move . a am coughing up thick white mucus . that can a do for this",1,91109,". i read your question carefully, and i understand your concern. from the information you gave, the first thing i suspect is muscle strain. the suspicion for this condition is even higher after you have done examination, even a ct scan. regarding the amoxicillin therapy, it is an antibiotic and i can't find a reason for taking that, but for sure the doctor that prescribed it had a reason for that. i do have some questions though. is the pain localized in you abdomen or between the lower ribs in your right side. the pain is steady, or it begins or worsens with movement? do you have any swelling or bruising? is it tender when you touch it? if it is more localized between your ribs, it gets worse with movements or sneezing or deep breathing, it might be tender when you touch it than probably it is just muscle strain (as i said you excluded major conditions with examination. besides this, the condition how it started (stretching too much to get something) and an acute onset, all lead to muscle strain. in general, muscle sprain can be treated with rice therapy - rest, ice application, compress and exercise. to alleviate the pain you could take pain medication like ibuprofen or naproxen. it is necessary to limit the movement of the torso (rest, but just the firs days). gentle stretching exercises can help strengthen the muscles. pain can be alleviated applying an ice pack for 15-20 minutes 2-3 times a day (ice should not be in direct contact with the skin). for a full recovery it can take 4-6 weeks. feel free for additional questions. i hope the answer helped you. best regards"

(as you said he has difficulty in walking now). you can also say to his parents that --- they can continue with all religious customs along with medicines, may be then they will agree... with medicine, he will start showing improvement in few days only... it is psychosis and patients will not agree to go to any doctor willingly, so you might need to take him forcefully. this is well accepted as it is for his benefit only. even if he doesn't agree for oral medicine there are injectables which are given to such patients... take the right step, take him to a doctor. hope the reply is useful feel free to ask more questions"

i have had a condition for the last 13 month now whereas it feels like a drop beat in my chest which happens everyday.but for the past 4 days these beats in my heart have been happening every 10 seconds . i got really scared and called an ambulance . i was on the heart monitors for 5 hours in the hospital and it was picking up my proble3m . the doctor said i am getting extra beats from the bottom of my heart and sent me home because their is nothing they can do for me . they have said nit is harmless but the problem is i am really scared and the beats are so intense . is this normal for a guy my age at 28 to be experiencing this . it is making me stressed out and the fear is terrifying .... do a have any advice for me ....... please help,1,25338,"hello and thank you for using chat doctor. i carefully read your question and understand your concern. but you should not worry, its nothing serious. as you describe, my opinion is that it might be a rhythm issue. someone can feel strong and fast heart beats for different reasons. it may be a simple sinus tachycardia. this means that the heart is beating faster than 100 beats for minute. its normal range in a resting condition is between 60-100 beats for minute. when it goes up you may feel a strong heart beat in your chest and a sensation like your body is beating too. another reason for this sensation might be what we call an ekstrasystol.these is electrical heart impulses that generates in some parts of heart different from normal sinus rhythm. this generates an escaped beat that the person feels like jumping ore bumping. it gives the sensation like a beat is skipping, may experience palpitations or an anxiety sensation that your daughter explains like trembling. this extrasistoles may happen from different reasons from simple emotional stress to other pathologies like anemia, hyperthyroidism etc. so, my opinion as cardiologist is that you have nothing to worry. it is just a simple episode, and it is quite normal in younger ages. only if these symptoms persist and begins to interfere the daily live, if i was your treating doctor i will recommend some examinations like a blood analysis to exclude anemia, the thyroid hormones, an electrocardiogram, echocardiography and of course a holder monitoring. this will help us to document and see what happens with heart rhythm. at meantime, i will recommend your daughter to avoid coffee, caffeine products because they rise heart frequency and extrasistolic beats. i encourage her to have physical training because sometimes it helps in reducing extrasistoles, tachycardia, even making them disappear. wish i was helpful. take good care. best regards"

a had a hysterectomy in 1994 . a was told it was a complete hysterectomy . recently a started seeing blood when a wipe . a cant really tell if its vaginal bleeding or from my urethra . ave seen an urologist and all tests have come back normal . would a have cervical cancer ?,1,74140,"hi. from your history, i could gather that you had stage 1 endometrial cancer for which hysterectomy was done, and it must be vaginal hysterectomy and since it showed endometrial cancer, so lymph node sampling by laparoscopic procedure, which is da vinci method (not opening the abdomen and seeing inside abdomen by camera). lymph node sampling is just to see involvement of lymph nodes in cancer and whether they need removal. if abdominal hysterectomy was done, they would have taken lymph nodes then only, if involvement suspected and depending on how much uterine muscle, cervix and parametric is involved(tissue around uterus) surgery is different. thanks."

( the gum surgery was 5 years ago ) thank you so much !",2,57293,"hi. welcome to chat doctor. as per your complaint it seems that you have inflammation of the gum flap surrounding the wisdom tooth and the condition is known as peritonitis. pericoronitis occurs if food gets lodged between wisdom tooth and the gum flap covering the wisdom tooth... and by food it does not mean that you see big food particles stuffed in there, but it also means uncleaned area and bacterial growth below gum flap... it leads to inflammation of the flap leading to pain swelling and as the area lies close to the throat there can be sore throat and swollen lymph nodes. but pain in the tooth in front of the wisdom tooth can be infection or decay in second molar tooth. the line of treatment is antibiotics, painkillers, mouthwash but only this is not enough to you, you should go to dentist again and ask him to irrigate the area between gum flap and wisdom tooth with saline, betadine solution and hy chat doctor. . other thing is done warm saline gargles, it will help you to reduce inflammation... carry on with the course of your antibiotics and painkillers, your pain and swelling must go in two three days. once you get relieved of your discomfort visit the dentist again and get an iop ar (x-ray) done to find out whether wisdom tooth will erupt to proper occlusion or is impacted (means having an obstruction and won't erupt to occlusion). if it is not impacted just get your gum flap removed known as operculectomy and if impacted get your tooth extracted... this will be your ultimate treatment and finish your problem forever. if the second molar tooth is also decayed leading to pain you can get root canal treatment done to save the tooth and resolve infection. hope you recover soon. thanks and regards."

"pm a 38 year old woman , a have been on birth control for the past year with no issues until this past month.i have been experiencing spotting a week before a finished my birth control and not having a normal period , what is the answer , could a be pregnant or just my pills agent strong enough ?",1,95284,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. if you have not taken your birth control pills for two weeks and are having unprotected intercourse, it is possible that you could have become pregnant. any woman of reproductive age who is not using contraception and having sex theoretically can get pregnant. some women do have some spotting a few days after conception if the fertilized egg implants in the uterus, which is known as implantation bleeding. however, the majority of women do not bleed at all when they conceive, and pregnancy symptoms really do not start until the pregnancy is large enough to produce hormones, which really takes a few weeks after conception. furthermore, is not unusual to have irregular bleeding and spotting after discontinuing birth control pills as well. so at this point, the only thing that you can do is wait until your menstrual period is due, and if your period is late, to perform a urine pregnancy test. modern urine pregnancy test become positive within 10 days to two weeks after conception, so in a few weeks you will be able to reliably test to see if you conceived. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was helpful. best of luck in getting pregnant,"

"hello , a recently fell through some wood and hit my right breast on the edge of something ( it all happened so fast a don to remember what a hit ) and now my breast is swelling and my ribs hurt like crazy . is it possible a broke a rib or did i just really hurt my breast ?",3,107693,"hi, welcome to chat doctor. based on the information provided by you, the breast lump could be a fibroadenoma or fibrotic disease. fibroadenoma is benign swelling which moves freely with in the breast tissue and is usually pains and often requires no treatment. fibrotic disease is usually seen in women in their 30s and present as a painful mass which does not move freely in breast tissue. it presents as pain during menstruation (cyclical nostalgia). you have not mentioned anything about pain in the swelling during menstruation. the possibility of fibrotic disease can be ruled out as you are 22 and you don't have any pain. so, the breast lump you have is a fibroadenoma. fnac does not remove the swelling. fnac is a test where some sample of the lump is taken through the needle and tested to know what type of swelling. evian capsules contain vitamin e and you can take them without any doubt. you need no special precautions and just stop worrying. please get the fnac done and if it turns out to be fibroadenoma, you do not need any surgery. surgery in fibroadenoma is required only when the lump is too big and causes mass effects. hope you got my point. take care"

"a had surgery to correct a hiatal hernia and acid reflux a year ago this past nov. and ever since , a have difficulty breathing just about every other day . prior to surgery , it was more frequent . a sleep on a wedge pillow , plus another standard pillow to prevent acid coming up , and a eat by 5:30 to give adequate time for food to digest ( this has helped tremendously to the point where a don to need medication regularly , but wonder why it happens every other day and is there anything else a can do ? and is it happening because acid comes up to my airway and creates swelling ? of -- my pulmonologist prescribed inhalers , but it brought no relief whatsoever .",1,34552,"the only thing for a cold sensation i can think of is acid reflux. when you get heart burn it feels crazy and can give anxiety (hence the rapid heart rate). you can remedy acid reflux (herd, or heart burn, throat burn or whatever you want to call it) by getting some digestive enzymes (try something like source naturals daily digestive enzymes) at a local vitamin store (or try vitacost.com) and till give her enough digestive juices to help grind up her food better. also, food intolerances will cause problems too. i discovered a food intolerance to wheat, milk and peanuts. but you have to write down how you feel after you eat something and try eliminating it for a while and see how it goes. you can ask a doctor for an elisa test (for food allergies) but it doesn't tell us much. a food elimination/rotation diet is much better plus it can't hurt. a sharp knife like feeling is definitely heart burn from what i've felt or heard about. make sure you write down when these things occur, what time and how long (dates) and what she had to eat earlier. pizza is a biggie on heart burn. hot dogs, anything with bad fats in it. bread if she is intolerant to wheat and so on. i would throw in a thyroid (tsh) test for hyper or hypothyroidism. so many symptoms stem from those diseases (difficulty breathing, rapid heart rate, digestion issues and so on)...that it should be warranted just to rule it out. and if it keeps happening see the doc. but sometimes i do believe we have to be our own detectives. my dd has a friend that was ill on and off for a couple of years and saw 11 doctors (hello, aren't they supposed to be intelligent beings?) but no, they couldn't figure out anything. finally, they figured out she has a gluten-allergy."

my friend was diagnosed ten years ago with portal vein thrombosis and just found out he has cirrhosis of the liver . the doctor also said he is not a candidate for operation as he has an enlarged spleen and numerous varieties ( not sure of spelling ) .... what are his options and how much quality time does he have left ?,2,87329,"hi, thanks for writing in to us. splenomegaly is a common complication of cirrhosis. many cirrhotics have platelet counts in the 60,000s. it is not something to worry about. and it doesn't need to be treated. you have plenty of platelets to properly clot your blood. blood flows from the spleen...through the portal vein...then through the liver. scar tissue in the liver (cirrhosis) can interfere with that blood flow, causing pressure to build up in the portal vein (portal hypertension), and the spleen to enlarge (splenomegaly). as the spleen enlarges, it traps platelets. (the amount of platelets in the bloodstream is reduced because the spleen is busy trapping them). so usually people with cirrhosis end up having a problem with portal hypertension and an enlarged spleen, and a reduced platelet count in the bloodstream. as time goes by, the liver may try to repair itself by growing new cells. if there is a lot of scar tissue already present the new cells grow between scar tissue (and result in abnormal nodules). the nodules and scar tissue further interfere with blood flow through the liver. so over time people with advanced cirrhosis can end up having a problem with more and more abnormal nodules and scar tissue forming which interferes even more with blood flow through the liver which makes the spleen continue to enlarge, and the platelet count continue to chat doctor. the splenomegaly is usually not reversible. please go for regular medical follow up. hope this helps"

"a had a root canal on tooth number 3 in december . after a round of antibiotics , a still felt discomfort in my right cheek . it gradually spread to my right eye and around to my temple . would this be a residual result of the root canal that requires another set of antibiotics ?",1,97409,"hello there...root canal treated (rct) tooth at times might result in pain after some time...improper irrigation and cleansing of the root canals while performing the treatment will lead to remnant of pulp tissue and bacteria to accumulate...improper maturation, ( filling up of the canal) will lead to dead space within the canal leading to accumulation of microorganisms.this in turn would lead to infection causing you pain...second reason might be that if your tooth is mobile and root canal treatment done was correct, owing to the weak periodontal support (tissues around the tooth) of the tooth, infection would set in causing pain....get a radiograph done and get yourself evaluated... you can use a course of anti-inflammatory to overcome your pain...don't worry...if the rct is not fine it can be re-done...."

by mothers blood pressure was 141/66 she also has a bad headache . the on high blood pressure medication . by mother is fasting for ramadan and will not drink or eat for 18 hours consecutively . the is 65 years old . that is your advise about her condition ?,1,38684,"hello, thank you for your query. i understand your concerns. for ideal blood glucose control the fasting blood glucose should be less than 110 mg/dl, the 2-hour post radial blood glucose should be less than 160-170 mg/do. i am not sure of your mothers age as these values are patients who are less than 55-60 years old and who are reasonably in good health. as a person becomes older or if there is a diabetic patient who has multiple problems, then these target values would also be a little higher than too tight control of an elderly persons blood glucose will cause them to have low blood glucose (hypoglycemia) and this can cause in serious complications. i am also not sure how often your mother is taking the glycimark m and the logo 0.2 mg. assuming your mother is less than 60 years old and that she is reasonably good health, if she is taking glycimark m 40/500 only once a day then it can be increased to twice a day (15 -30 min before breakfast and before dinner). if she is already taking this tablet twice a day, then she can increase the dose of this, she can take glycimark m 80/500 twice a day. recheck her blood glucose levels in 2 weeks. if her blood glucose is still high then she can take logo 0.2 mg either twice a day (if previously she has been taking it only once) or up to three times a day (if she has been taking it only twice a day). if at any point she experienced low blood glucose symptoms like sweating, hunger, dizziness, fast heart beat, mood changes etc., then it is the glycimark-m that is causing the symptoms, and she needs to reduce the dose of this. the immediate treatment of low blood glucose is by taking a tablespoon of honey/sugar, sugar candies, glass of fruit juice or regular pepsi/coke etc. this should be followed by a carboy chat doctor. her blood pressure is fine, and she needs to continue with her advance and cretan. i hope this answer has helped you. regards"

"by 3 month old has had diarrhoea the past 2 days . there are also small chunks in his stool . be is only formula fed ( similar alimentum ) . is behavior is still the same , no change in eating habits . be is soaking his diaper with the diarrhoea about 43 times a day and it leaks out . should a be concerned ?",1,62311,"hi, welcome to chat doctor. your child is 6 month old and is passing stools 5 to 6 times per day, and the stool is watery. a 6-month child can pass stools 5 to 6 times per day or may pass stool once in a day, both these things are normal. but the stools should not be watery and should not bother the child. since, your child has watery stools on taking formula milk, it seems that your child has probably some allergy to that formula milk. in my opinion, you should change the formula milk to some other brand, it will solve your problem. if after changing formula milk, the problem persists then we have to think of cow milk allergy and start the child on lactose free milk. i hope this will help you. take care."

"a a trying to get pregnant and been taking prenatal vitamins since april 2014 . a had a miscarriage but in january 2014 at 8 weeks pregnant , the doc said to wait 2 menstrual cycles and start trying again , is august 2014 and we re still trying .... a be been taking prenatal vitamins since april ... any other advice please",1,10535,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. pregnacare conception is simply a combination of vitamins that help a woman have a healthy pregnancy from conception. it has no hormonal effects and should not have any impact on the regularity of your cycle nor your ability to conceive, it is not unusual for women to bleed on and off for even 6 weeks after a miscarriage so the 19-day bleeding episode you had may not have actually been a menstrual period but still could have been bleeding leftover for your d and c. so you may not be ""late"" at all, but may just have not had a real period since the pregnancy. there is no reason to assume you would have problems getting pregnant again since you have conceived naturally twice in the last year. either way, the pregnancies conception vitamins have nothing to do with your irregular bleeding. it is generally advisable to wait to try to conceive again after your first real period-so i would wait until you bleed again to resume trying to conceive. if you do not get a real period by 3 months from your last bleeding episode, you should follow up for your gun for a re-evaluation of your hormones and treatment with progesterone, which can restart your period cycling. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful. best wishes,"

"i , my uncle has prostate cancer and was rushed to the hospital on sunday because he was bleeding from the nose and the local doctors couldn't stop the bleeding . they gave him plasma which has stopped the bleeding now ... be also was scheduled for a gamma treatment because they found a tutor in the brain area ... he did have the treatment today ... is wife and daughter tell us they he does not have good colour and they are afraid that this is a bad sign and that he might die ... are they wrong to think this way ? be is also schedule for chemo treatments in the near future once he regains his strength .... can you give us any guidance as to his prognosis ?",1,105897,"hi. to begin with, the treatment that your husband has undergone seems to be correct medically, more or less. to begin with he was suffering from locally advanced prostate cancer which was downstage and then surgically removed. however, he had a relapse of his disease in the bones and was placed on hormonal treatment. he seemed to be suffering from hormone resistant prostate cancer which can occur in 10% patients to start with. thus, he failed to respond to most of the treatments and eventually died of his disease. at every stage of progression, doing a scan is not mandatory. just a rising psa and symptoms are enough to know that the disease is progressing. doing a scan only documents that the disease has spread to a particular part. it will neither change the treatment nor the outcome. the blood was basically because of 2 reasons. one the disease in the lung which can commonly lead to bleeding on its own of varying quantity. added to that was the fact that he was in liver failure which further increases the chances of bleeding from any site. zynga has many side effects and one has to weigh the risks against the benefits and take a call. i assume, and you should to that the call to give zynga despite liver failure by your doctor was in good faith and based on sound judgement. i think the only part where your doctor failed you entirely was by not keeping you informed at every step the prognosis, the treatment options, the disease status and the likely outcome. it is something that i would have done and is nothing but unfortunate. while it would not have changed the outcome of your husband, it might have left you in peace after his demise. hope my answer takes care of your unrest in some measure, and you find strength enough to move on in life. take care"

i a had some lab work done . by glutamyltransferase came back high . that is glutamyltransferase . that problems can this cause ?,1,74841,hit hanks for posting your query to chat doctor . there are many causes for raised alkaline phosphatase. in fact raised alkaline phosphate can also be due to bone or intestinal problems apart from liver. so going for a liver biopsy only for raised alkaline phosphatase is not advisable. if your raised alkaline phosphatase is associated with raised serum levels of gamma glutamyltransferase then the source of raised alkaline phosphatase is considered as liver. even in that case raised alkaline phosphatase could be due to frequent consumption of alive. i advise stopping taking alive and ask your doctor for a substitute. also stop chat doctor. repeat the test after 1 month and revert. any clarifications feel free to ask.
i a had some lab work done . by glutamyltransferase came back high . that is glutamyltransferase . that problems can this cause ?,2,56499,"hi, thanks for posting in chat doctor. i have read the description and understand your concern. leptospirosis is an infection caused by a spirochete bacteria called leptospira. since the infection is known to cause liver dysfunction, there is a moderate elevation of transaminase got, sgpt enzymes and gamma-glutamyltransferase (ggt) levels. however, the levels should come back to normal by about 6 months. the enzymes continue to be elevated in your case could be due to alcohol consumption, as it would aggravate the underlying damage and delay the healing process. since alcohol can cause inflammation on liver and amount to its damage, it would be advisable to limit your consumption or stop it completely. along with it, you need to consume less fat diet and to supplement mixotrophic factors regularly to keep your liver healthy. hope the information provided would be helpful. all the best."
i a had some lab work done . by glutamyltransferase came back high . that is glutamyltransferase . that problems can this cause ?,3,27891,"hello madam, thank you for your question and welcome to chat doctor. i read your query carefully and i understand your concerns. gamma glutamyltransferase or ggt is a liver enzyme that has traditionally been measured to detect liver health and function and alcohol consumption. the normal range for ggt in your blood is 0 to 51 international units/liter, so your test report is slightly elevated. the most common cause of increased ggt level is overuse of alcohol, as in your case 3 glasses of wine a day are considered high. ggt blood levels are usually high when the liver is damaged, and in order to prevent further damage, i would suggest you to cease alcohol, or at least decrease the amount of consumption. hope this answers your question. if you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. i will be happy to answer your questions. take care,"
