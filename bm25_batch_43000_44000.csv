"by husband had triple bypass heart surgery four months ago . be has experienced extreme dizziness since the surgery . be have seen all specialists ; ent , cardiologist , and neurologist . be has had all tests available . to you know what causes this and will it go away in time ?",1,104444,"hi and thanks for the query, it is important to know why you had this chest pain. it is important to know if you had ever experienced this before or not. a complete past history and a chest x-ray could help. an infection, gastritis and heart disease are all possibilities. tests like the chest x-ray, microscopy, ekg and a cardiac ultrasound might be important in the evaluation process. but all these have to be guided by an appropriate and thorough clinical review. thanks and kind regards."
"by husband had triple bypass heart surgery four months ago . be has experienced extreme dizziness since the surgery . be have seen all specialists ; ent , cardiologist , and neurologist . be has had all tests available . to you know what causes this and will it go away in time ?",2,95,"hello thank you for posting here. i have gone through your description. since he has two blocks in the heart arteries, and he is advice bypass, the right choice is to go ahead with bypass surgery. i don't know any therapy named kelley, but i suppose you are talking about ch elation therapy. this therapy is of no benefit for the patient. the blocks in the heart artery are embedded inside the heart vessel and any amount of medication or therapy cannot decrease it to make it vanish. medications can only help to stop progression of the block. definitive way to treat critical heart blockages is an angioplasty or bypass surgery. had you been my patient my advice would be to go ahead with bypass? bypass surgery requires a stay of 7- 10 days approx in the hospital. patient can start walking usually by day 5 after surgery. it requires a recovery period of 20 -25 days, but the long term results of bypass are very good with patients having a good quality of life. gastric ulcers can be treated with long term antacids. gastric ulcers are not a contraindication for surgery. wishing you good health thank you"

a was diagnosed with primary binary cirrhosis back in 1996 . a didst know much about it since that was before computers ! ! ! a am wondering if this disease can be held at bay or is it definite the liver will get worse and a need a transplant or possibly die from the cirrhosis ?,1,61583,"hello mr santos, i am so sorry to hear about your diagnosis. by your description, i understand you have developed ""portal hypertension"" which is a complication of cirrhosis of the liver. this manifests as either esophageal varices which can bleed or as ascites (fluid build up in the belly). liver cirrhosis also prevents some chemicals in the body from being purified and this can enter the brain leading to sleepiness and confusion (encephalopathy). propranolol helps in decreasing the portal hypertension and prevents the varices from bleeding. lactulose prevents the chemicals from being absorbed from the intestine and so will prevent the confusion (encephalopathy). the prognosis of your cirrhosis will depend on the cause of cirrhosis. unfortunately irreversible liver damage has already occurred to your liver and now the aim will be to prevent further deterioration and prevent complications. if the cirrhosis was due to alcohol, complete abstinence will delay the progression of cirrhosis. if it is due to some form of hepatitis, unfortunately there is not a lot of left to do since anti-hepatitis treatment cannot be given in cirrhosis. the best treatment for cirrhosis, especially for someone in your stage is liver transplant. it will not only get rid of the cirrhotic liver, but also treat the portal hypertension completely. i would advise you to actively seek a liver transplant center and get evaluated for candidacy for a transplant. hope this helped and i hope you feel better. please do not hesitate to contact me personally for any further details - rxsuresh@gmail.com"

by father was diagnosed with hurtle cell carcinoma last march with a 5 pm tutor on his thyroid . which he had removed . be is 77 years old . be is still feeling really bad and he had radiation several months ago . that are his chances of beating this cancer ?,1,90747,"hi, thanks for writing in. many people end up with a second cancer with a history of having been treated for an earlier cancer with radiation therapy. however, at that time, providing radiation therapy had more benefits and risks and has helped in treating the testicular cancer and your husband has been free from symptoms almost 25 years. plasma cell dysplasia can be seen in such patients but saying with confirmation that it is indeed the radiation that is responsible is difficult. radiation effects are both dose dependent and non dose dependent. if your husband was exposed to radiation in error at his workplace then things would have been different but in the present case he has been given radiation therapy as a treatment and that has been successful to a certain extent. there are also patients who develop a second cancer that is unrelated to the first cancer. to know the chances of the prior radiation treatment causing the plasma cell dysplasia, all his medical records have to be verified and that will only give a risk. it cannot be said with certainty that the radiation given 25 years back is completely responsible for his present health condition."

"a went hiking yesterday , and during the hike , i managed to trip over a fallen over tree . a landed hard on the ground , which was mostly smooth flat rock , atop my water bottle . by water bottle was in my stomach pouch of my sweater . my abdominal area has been giving me sharp to dull pains ever since , and i was unable to sleep well because of it . i am 18 , 5 4 , and 289 pounds . i have no serious illnesses , except a slightly high cholesterol level . should i be concerned about anything serious like internal bleeding or such ?",1,103171,"hello friend, thank you for posting your query through chat doctor. i also think that you were affected by a virus for the last one week. but that virus is not what you are talking about. virus is a biological waste particle in your body as a result of the disease and not the cause of diseases. i am a homeopath and so you be prepared to hear something different about your diseases. the virus i meant was something in the dynamic level, a mental conflict. since in your opinion these mental influences have no significance, you did not mention anything about that in your query. these mental conflicts made you sick to the level of reducing your immunity. this made you susceptible to diseases. the first disease was a conjunctivitis, a relatively harmless affection. but when you started suppressing it with local application, it went to a deeper level producing deeper affections. your conjunctivitis was in the epidermal level but the period problem and the unusual tiredness was in the euro endocrine level. that is why you had a very bad period this time. all your hormonal system got shattered, and you suffered unusually bad this time. now my suggestion is that you should stop external application or medication to control conjunctivitis. it can be managed simply by frequent washing of eyes with pure cold water. you are advised to have constitutional treatment to strengthen and cleanse your constitution. i can confidently suggest you to take homeopathy for that. you have proved that your health is not very good because you have the history of cancer and getting periods only once in a year after chemotherapy. my concern is more about your constitution which reacts badly to any stimulation and my advice is to get homeopathic treatment from an expert. i can also help you provided you ask a premium question, or you contact me directly with more details about you because homeopathy never treats your diseases but treats only you. with best wishes, chat doctor. j. varese, homoeopath,"

"i , pm a 26 year old male and a am experiencing lower back pain only on my lest side . it started three weeks ago , out of nowhere , and has been off and on . in a scale of ten a would rate the pain as a 7 . it is manageable , but it hurts when a try to touch my toes . a think a should go to the doctor , but a done know if a should see a specialist or what . that do you think ?",1,21962,"dear simone, there is one rule for doctors here in croatia: when you think too much, stop, and think again, but this time think for the simplest diagnose. if you have pain in abdomen and an umbilical hernia seen on us then the first thing to think about is ""abdominal pain caused by hernia"":). there are many conditions in medicine where pain doesn't need to beau localized near the ""pathology"". sometimes pain can be felt on the opposite side of the affected organ. it is known that one of common symptom of myocardial infarction is pain in the left shoulder. also, infection of the abdominal organs can give many types and localizations of pain. the reason for it is simple: when i see pain, i see nerves, not organs (this is my own phrase:)). nerves conduct pain, and nerves are all around, going from periphery to the brain, so pain can be localized on its pathway, so just let's go back to your problem. doctor should tell you the size of hernia and its content which can be only preperitoneal tissue, momentum or even intestines. this dark triangle...mmm.it can be nothing and everything. i usually don't trust our ultrasonographer because they are strange people... sometimes they don't see what they need to see, or they see what they don't need to see. all i see is that us is operator-dependent diagnostic test... but we shouldn't underestimate this finding. it can be uterine moma, endometriosis, cyst or tumor. and yes, it can cause pain you're describing. so what you need to do: 1. ct scan of pelvic and abdominal region. why? as i said, these us findings are always doubtful, ct is a high sensitive test which will find the exact problem for sure. it will tell you the size and severity of hernia and the morphology of this uterine lesion. it can also find some other problems in its early phase."

i have had a cyst on the left hand side of my face for years now which has never caused me any pain but every now and then it starts excreting pus and the smell is so vile and dirty it makes ; me sick then all of a sudden it stops and never bothers me for months again .. what is this ?,1,34243,"dear, first, please understand that pulmonary stenosis is basically the tightness of one of the valves on the right side of the heart and in your daughters case, it seems to be by birth. you have mentioned that she underwent cardiac cat hat the age of 1, but you did not mention that only the path study was done and what was the gradient at that time or the ballooning was also done. now she is 7 years old, and she never had any symptoms as per you (i presume she never had palpitations, loss of consciousness, chest pain, swelling feet or face, easy navigability), so i would just do echo to look for the gradient across the pulmonary valve and then decide if the cardiac cat his required or not. now coming to your worry about the leakage in the valve. a tight valve is rigid and it doesn't close properly sometimes leading to leakage which can sometimes become worrisome and needs surgery. and ballooning of the tight valve can also lead to some leakage in the valve and this ballooning is done only if there is no leakage initially. i hope i have cleared your queries to some extent!! all the best"

good afternoon . over the last couple of months ( maybe 6 ) i have had a couple dizzy spells . ( while i am sitting down at the computer ; once while i was cooking dinner and once while sitting watching to ) . it feels like something strange in my head like something popped .... my my eye sight goes black for a split second and they over the next couple minutes it will get better and better until it goes away .,1,53315,"good afternoon. i can certainly tell that you are not the nervous type if you are willing to write your question out and submit it the way you have. that takes a bit of courage. there are a couple of things to come to my mind when you describe your situation. one is called orthostatic hypotension or also orthostatic tremors. this condition is one where a person can start shaking in their hands and their knees and their arms and their legs after they have been up on their feet for a few seconds or a few minutes. usually, when this starts to happen, and they sit down the shaking goes away. the other thing is called benign essential tremor or benign essential familial tremor if the condition runs in one of your family members. however, in this case i would go preferentially with the first one since it seems as if your trimmers get worse when you are standing and writing something.at any rate, you should see a doctor who can take your blood pressure is in different positions such as lying, sitting, and standing and make a determination whether not you may have such an entity. would you please rate this answer with a star rating if it meets your approval for what you were looking for. and good luck to you in school."

a took azithromycin for 3 days about 4 weeks ago and a am taking the birth control medicine odessa . a continued using it while a took the antibiotic . about 7 days after finishing the azithromycin my husband and a had sex and the only birth control we used was the pull out method . it has been three weeks since that happened and a woke up this morning feeling nauseous . a done have any other symptoms . would a be pregnant . a took an over the counter test this morning and it came back negative but a know it may be way too soon to tell . a cant determine when a should take one since a done get periods while on the pill .,1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"a didst have my period for 1month and 7days until today . pm a pregnant ? a had my period last may 26 . a had sex last may 30 and june 9 , and the only method we used is withdrawal . a also took a home pregnancy test and the result is negative , is it 100 % accurate ?",1,49266,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. if you last had your period on september 12th, and today is october 5th, your period is not yet late for october. most women have a 25-35 day cycle, so until you actually miss your period for october, there is no reason to assume you are pregnant. the folic acid and zinc you are taking are just extra vitamins that provide health to a growing pregnancy; these should not affect or change your menstrual cycle or its symptoms. if your period is late in october, you should purchase and perform an over-the-counter pregnancy test. modern pregnancy tests are very accurate and can be positive even 10 days after conception. if you do find out you are pregnant, there is nothing that needs to be done immediately as pregnancy is not a disease- it is a normal state for women in the reproductive phase of their lives. so it is important only to keep taking your vitamins, get plenty of rest, eat a balanced diet and avoid alcohol, caffeine and chat doctor. if your period is mate, but you are not pregnant, the delay in your cycle can have a number of causes, including hormonal imbalances, certain medical conditions like thyroid disease, and even the stress of worrying about pregnancy. if you miss more than 2 months of your cycle (no bleeding for 3 months) and your pregnancy test is negative, you should see a physician for a hormonal evaluation. so in summary, a late menstrual cycle can be caused by pregnancy, but there are other causes as well. i suggest you perform a pregnancy test if you are late, and if it is negative, try to be patient, and you will likely get it before another month goes by. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"hello- an taking vitamin a supplements stain your teeth ? a started taking more b12 ( 1000 units a day ) about a year ago and my dentist has noticed more staining on my teeth during cleanings . a also started using coq10 . be re trying to figure out ( as my diet has to changed ) what a causing the stains . also , about a year ago , a started a new regiment for hiv -- -triumeq ( which consolidates three pills into one ) so a a just trying to figure out how to stave off the stains per my dentist . thank you !",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"i , a have been on birth control biz for about 3 years now a have never had a problem . a do seem to notice that when a did get my period it was for only two days and that was normal , however this last month it seems like a had my period in the middle of my pack ! like 2 weeks early but it was very short and a thought maybe it was just spotting . anyways , now a am on my 4th day of placebo pills and haven to gotten my actual planned period and have no are period symptoms . pm really confused on whats happening , a have had sex but never unprotected without a condom .",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

hi in a 29 year old male . a recently found a lump on the left side of my neck just behind my ear and am wondering what it is ? to about the size of a ten pence piece and is slightly painful . a have also noticed blood in my stools . would this be cancer ?,1,33931,"hi michele jacobi the first thing that has to be done once you find a lump in the region of the chest wall is to confirm what it is. in your case a biopsy has already been done and let us await its result. you're understanding that cancerous lumps don't bleed after biopsy is correct. but i think your presumption that if it was scar tissue it would have bled is not correct. scar tissue also need not bleed. needle biopsies do not usually cause any bleeding unless a blood vessel is ruptured during the procedure since how long have you noticed this lump. is the size of the lump increasing ? if the biopsy comes as positive for cancer then you will have to undergo a series of investigation to find out he the extent of the disease. ? whether it is confined to the chest wall only or whether it has gone beyond the chest wall to other regions. treatment decision will depend on the results of this if the biopsy comes as negative for cancer then there are 2 options 1- if your physician thinks it is insignificant then you need to follow it up. just keep a check on your lump to see whether it is increasing in size and also get it checked by your physician regularly2- the second option (and my preference) is to do an open biopsy especially if the lump was detected recently and is increasing in size and also if the lump is firm to hard (and not very soft). the reason is needle biopsy can be negative, but this does not always mean there is no cancer especially if the tissue sample taken is not adequate. also time factor is important. you may lose time keeping the lump under follow up to see whether it is increasing in size hope you are satisfied with my reply. anyway don't worry. follow your doctors' advice chat doctor."

hi a was curious a had my arena removed monday the 29 have not bleed at all except a very little after sex that same night and now today a have wiped twice and there is a brown discharge only when a wipe though and have had unprotected sex 2 or 3 times since a had it taken out could this be implantation bleeding,1,448,"hello and i hope i can help you today.first, i want to reassure you that it is not possible that you could have conceived if you had unprotected sex before your implant was removed. implanon is nearly 100 percent effective in preventing pregnancy while it is in place, and it takes time for you to ovulate again (at least 7-10 days) after it is removed. so if you only had unprotected sex immediately before and after your implant was removed, it is unlikely you could have conceived so quickly. pregnancy symptoms vary widely between women, and many of the same symptoms we commonly associate with pregnancy such as nausea, bloating, breast tenderness, headaches and irregular bleeding can also happen from an irregular menstrual cycle as well as pregnancy. many women have irregular periods after discontinuing a hormonal birth control method. so, i suggest you wait for your period, which should occur around 4 weeks after your implant removal, and if you miss your period, a urine pregnancy test will be accurate at this time. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful. best wishes,"

"hello , a have noticed a lump in my chest approx . 4 pm wide , a fist length down from my sternum . its been 4-5 months now and its seems to get slightly bigger . it does to hurt at all and is quite soft and squishy to touch . it is noticeable to see from a distance as its slightly raised out of my chest . a thought it was just going to pass as a cyst but has to .",1,33931,"hi michele jacobi the first thing that has to be done once you find a lump in the region of the chest wall is to confirm what it is. in your case a biopsy has already been done and let us await its result. you're understanding that cancerous lumps don't bleed after biopsy is correct. but i think your presumption that if it was scar tissue it would have bled is not correct. scar tissue also need not bleed. needle biopsies do not usually cause any bleeding unless a blood vessel is ruptured during the procedure since how long have you noticed this lump. is the size of the lump increasing ? if the biopsy comes as positive for cancer then you will have to undergo a series of investigation to find out he the extent of the disease. ? whether it is confined to the chest wall only or whether it has gone beyond the chest wall to other regions. treatment decision will depend on the results of this if the biopsy comes as negative for cancer then there are 2 options 1- if your physician thinks it is insignificant then you need to follow it up. just keep a check on your lump to see whether it is increasing in size and also get it checked by your physician regularly2- the second option (and my preference) is to do an open biopsy especially if the lump was detected recently and is increasing in size and also if the lump is firm to hard (and not very soft). the reason is needle biopsy can be negative, but this does not always mean there is no cancer especially if the tissue sample taken is not adequate. also time factor is important. you may lose time keeping the lump under follow up to see whether it is increasing in size hope you are satisfied with my reply. anyway don't worry. follow your doctors' advice chat doctor."

hello sir from marriage i didst conceived even one time also . doctors told me that i have cyst but last month they do hystroscopy and laparoscopy surgery . now they planned for if on august month 30/6/2013 is my lamp from 14th they advice me to take duoluton a tablets a .. o. w. my doubt is if i didst take duoluton a tablets there is a chance for conceived or not for this month .,1,81894,"here you need to know if it's a normal fracture with just a cut in bone it takes 1 month to heal, if there is cut with segmental fracture where the fracture piece is not in touch with bone above and bone below then it takes 2-3 months time to heal. but if there is segmental fracture along with crushed bone pieces then it takes 4-6 month time to heal. now here you need to see which kind of fracture you are having along with this age as well your diet and calcium with vitamin d tablets also matter a lot for healing. here you have informed some doctors have suggested for bone grafting and some doctors have suggested to wait. i suggest if your fracture is healing and is better than what it was before after few months on x-ray then don't worry it will be all right. it may take some time. you need to have good enough of calcium with vitamin d in diet as well as supplement. but if there is no healing sign even after 3-4 month, and it is still as it is meaning you can try with calcium and vitamin d supplement for 2 months and see later on x-ray. or else you can go ahead for surgery that is bone grafting. if it's paining too much then make sure there is no infection as well no displacement of implant. and you can keep using hot and cold pack for some more relief. i have given you here general guideline, but i am sure this will be useful for you. take care."

be just noticed a large swollen lump on the side of the face of our 3 month old baby . its located on the side of the face just in front of the ear . the lump is about 1.5 inch in length and about an inch in width . it is visible from several feet away . it is not discoloured and is fairly hard to the touch . it doesn't appear to be causing any pain . that could it be ?,1,37966,"hit hanks for the query. as per your explanation of symptoms and location of the swelling as you told that it is located right under the jaw shows that the lump is due to swelling in the sub mandibular salivary gland which is located just below the lower jaw. the swelling can be due to obstruction in the ducts of the salivary gland due to formation of crystalline stones in the ducts of the gland, and they are formed from the minerals present in the saliva. it leads to back flow of saliva into the gland leading to swelling. it can also be due to formation of cysts or tumors into the glands. it can also be due to infection in the gland, but an infection most commonly causes painful and tender swelling. if there is already any infection in any part of the mouth, face or any other body part and if the swelling is round and mobile can be mostly a lymph node swelling.you need not get panic as it is most commonly a non-cancerous swelling. i would suggest you to consult an oral pathologist and get evaluated for the exact cause of the swelling and get treated. obstruction in the ducts can be cleared by locating and removing the stones either by palpating and pushing the stone towards canal opening and in case of large stones a small incision placed inside mouth and stone is removed. infections in gland or lymph nodes can be treated by antibiotics. hope this helps. regards."

a have a very sharp intense pain on my left side in between my hip bone and belly button . when a cough or sneeze the pain is intense . of a lie down it does to seem to be as bad until a hop up . it is sore if a push on it . the pain makes me feel a little breathless as well,1,72783,"hi, thanks for your query.* left side chest pain is what we are always afraid of as heart issues can give such symptom.however, if the pain has appeared suddenly with shortness of breath and some radiation to the arm, pneumothorax is possible. this condition can appear with no reason. sometimes sudden cough or sudden lift of heavy object can cause it. it is more possible if you smoke or have chronic lungs' disease like asthma or bronchitis. if nothing like that is present, strained muscle is the most probable reason. strained muscle usually appears only when the chest is moving, and should be completely gone when lying down and not breathing. if the pain is sharp and well localized, more intense when breathing, rib nerve issue is the most probable reason. in both cases, rest and anti-inflammatory medicines like diclofenac should help. i do hope that you have found something helpful, and i will be glad to answer any further query. take care"

hello a have some health issues going on and have noticed my arm palpitating when a woke up then now . by body is an upright position nothing strange . arm and body are in a position where the blood flow is normal . however a felt this again and just wondering what it is ? thank you,3,41571,"hello, unfortunately for physicians ""shaking"" is a very vague term, and it could mean many kinds of movements, ranging from tremulousness of the body, to flailing, to arrhythmic shaking to rhythmic shaking and all have very different implications. however, i will give you the most common cause of what you saw. most likely what occurred is called ""convulsive syncope"" which means that when you pass out you have some jerking movements, but it is not considered a seizure. what happens is that blood flow is disrupted to the brain and the person loses consciousness. because the nerve cells are suddenly deprived of oxygen, they fire abnormally for a few times causing body jerking, but when the person collapses blood flow is restored and the movements stop. so essentially the movements are caused by passing out and not by a seizure. likely what happened also was what we call a ""vasovagal reaction"" in which due to stress, emotional response among other things, the blood vessels dilate and blood rushed down from the head into the legs causing a person to pass out. the classic example of this is when a person who is getting their blood chat doctor. it is not considered abnormal, and can happen to anybody. lastly, just to describe what a true seizure looks like. typically, what happens is that a person will first stiffen up, the eyes will turn up into the head with the eyes remaining open. there is often a very loud scream due to the abdominal muscles tensing up and expelling air from the lungs. the stiffening phase is then followed by a rhythmic, whole body shaking. when i say rhythmic i mean that the jerks occur at regular intervals and at the same time in all extremities of the body. the gradually slow down and the person becomes limp and often is breathing very hard. when they wake up there is almost always confusion that lasts several minutes and then slowly the person returns to their normal state of mind. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

i a fell off of a horse seven days ago while on action in the dominican republic . a broke 6 ribs and had to stay in a hospital there for 5 days before being cleared to fly home to the of . a had a pretty bad time time with the way a was given of . it had to be moved four different times because it came out of the vein and my hand on two occasions sole to the point of looking and feeling like they would burst as well as my forearm ! a know have a knot near site in my forearm and it only hurts when touched . should a be worried ?,1,76090,"thanks for your question on chat doctor. in my opinion you should not worry much about it, as it is due to pleural thickening only. you had blunt chest trauma 1 year ago and had fractured or injured ribs. this might be giving pleural reaction at that time. so with time, healing occur in ribs as well as pleura. and healing in pleura occur as thickening and fibrosis. so the smoothness and friction free movements of pleura, at the site of injury is lost. so you can have feeling of pain or friction in the injury area. sometimes it can also give hypersensitivity in it. so get done ultrasound examination of local chest area, if pleural thickening is there then no need to worry much."

"hello i have been poorly 4 ten day seen my up twice he told me i have laryngitis and have been taking doxycline for 8 days i done feel any better , my ears feel like they have the sea in them when i lie down and also my temperature goes up at night ? any advice will be helpful",1,89135,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the bumps you likely are feeling on your cervix are most likely nathan cysts rather than polyps. polyps are fleshy soft growths that are just out pouching of the normal glands that line the canal of the cervix. it would be difficult to feel them, and they usually cause irregular bleeding or bleeding after sex. they do not cause infertility (uterine polyps can, but those are not the same and are not possible to feel because they are inside your uterus. nabothian cysts are just blocked mucus glands that can feel like knobby bumps on the cervix. they also are not harmful and do not interfere with fertility. both of these findings on your cervix can be seen on a spectrum exam, so a gun doctor would be able to tell you what you are feeling if they looked inside you. also, regarding the position of your cervix, this also has no bearing on fertility and does not change from month to month, so you do not need to check your cervix regularly especially if you have a yearly gynecologic checkup. regarding bbt charting for conception, your temperature goes up after you ovulate, so i recommend not checking it anymore if you know around when you ovulate in your cycle and just have sex every other day from the time your period finishes until you feel premenstrual symptoms. some women only have sex after their temperature goes up, and they miss the actual time of ovulation. so there is no reason to suspect you will have problems conceiving, and you do not need to be treated for this because it is a normal finding in many women. 80 percent of couples will conceive within a year. if you have been having sex at the right time and it's almost a year, it might be wise to have a gun exam and a hormonal evaluation, and also have your fiancé get his sperm count checked, as 50 percent of the time it can be a male factor. i hope i was able to answer your question and that my advice was helpful. best wishes and good luck with your pregnancy plans,"

(would you be having it then?) now your cycle is of 30 days period. so the expected date of ovulation should be 07 january. hence, if the conception takes place on 07 january, the due date of delivery would be 30 september. the hitch here is that you should have ovulation taking lace on 07 january. moreover, we have noticed that all the pregnancies do not last for 280 days. the delivery can take place any time between 3 weeks earlier to 1 week later than the expected due date of delivery. keeping these facts and calculations in mind, you may plan your sexual relations accordingly. i hope this will help you."

by girlfriend is 20 years old and was just diagnosed with a benign inoperable heart tutor wrapped around her aorta ... the tutor is apparently imbedded in the walls of her heart ... the doctor said she was a ticking time bomb but she also mentioned something about sex viva surgery .... the has seen 3 doctors all of which say inoperable .... now long does she have to live ? of we can find a doctor to operate- what are the chances she survives the surgery ?,1,22694,"hello thanks for posting here. i have gone through your description. she has critical heart disease involving the three arteries if the heart. and since her pumping function has chat doctor. so once blocked arteries in the heart are diagnosed, there are two methods to open it. angioplasty and bypass surgery. as your doctor has advice angioplasty cannot be done because of triple vessel disease and also involving the arteries where they bifurcate. so surgery is the only option in her. surgery with a low pumping function is definitely riskier than one with a normal function. but here you have to assess the risk versus benefits. if you don't do the surgery then you are not treating the cause. her quality of life will be poor, she will get tired easily, and she stands the probability of having further heart attacks also which will further decrease the function. going ahead with the surgery will improve quality of life, she can do her day-to-day activities, travel etc. however despite surgery pumping function will not increase more than 35%. but the risks of heart attacks is evaded. another thing that should be considered is how mobile she is. as you said she has left sided weakness. if she is bed bound and requires help for her day-to-day activities, then a surgery would be more of a suffering to her. a cabg surgery has a good outcome and patients usually do well for 12-15 years. nowadays with advanced technologies and approaches, heart surgery risks have come down a lot. i personally have seen patients with 25-30% do well with cabg. so my advice is it will be worthwhile to take a call for cabg.

hi i am male 22 i have hand tremor just on my hands specially when i am in front of any person i start become more nervous and my hand start shaking can not hold a simple camera to take someone pic but if i am alone i feel more comfortable and my hands are not shaking pizzazz tell me any cure of it and i am physically fit and not any type of problem ...,1,53315,"good afternoon. i can certainly tell that you are not the nervous type if you are willing to write your question out and submit it the way you have. that takes a bit of courage. there are a couple of things to come to my mind when you describe your situation. one is called orthostatic hypotension or also orthostatic tremors. this condition is one where a person can start shaking in their hands and their knees and their arms and their legs after they have been up on their feet for a few seconds or a few minutes. usually, when this starts to happen, and they sit down the shaking goes away. the other thing is called benign essential tremor or benign essential familial tremor if the condition runs in one of your family members. however, in this case i would go preferentially with the first one since it seems as if your trimmers get worse when you are standing and writing something.at any rate, you should see a doctor who can take your blood pressure is in different positions such as lying, sitting, and standing and make a determination whether not you may have such an entity. would you please rate this answer with a star rating if it meets your approval for what you were looking for. and good luck to you in school."

pm a woodworker . a few weeks ago a was cutting on a table saw and the blade hit a small nail and a small piece hit me in the chest . a didst think it went in but it did . a can still feel it under the skin but it feels like its gone deeper . the material was steel and it was clean and just out of the box ( no rust ) . will it dissolve or should a be concerned about something serious ?,1,93840,"hello, i can understand your concern. if the lump is where you got the extraction, there might be two possibilities. firstly, it might be a hematoma from the anesthetic injection that was given to you. if that is the case, then the lump will dissolve itself in a few days and no treatment is necessary except ice compressions. the other possibility could be a left infected root piece that was not removed during extraction, or presence of a cyst or granuloma which was the reason for the tooth extraction but is left behind. i would advise you to visit your dentist and get an x-ray of the extraction site. if the root piece, cyst or granuloma would be present, it will be seen on the x-ray and treatment can be planned to remove it. in addition, you can also get a follow-up from the dentist regarding the healing process of the extraction socket. continue the antibiotic and painkiller to keep infection and pain in control. if few days have passed since the extraction, you can do warm salt water gargles to make healing process faster and keep the extraction site clean of debris and infection. i hope this information helps you. thank you for choosing chat doctor. i wish you feel better soon. best,"

and is there a simple definitive test to diagnose this ? that type of doctor should a see ? a be also noticed a few years ago that a seem to also be allergic to tylenol after never having been before . a had pretty standard allergic reaction symptoms . by lips swelled up , a felt itchy , and difficulty breathing . it lasted for only a few minutes and went away . since then a have been staying clear of barley , cayenne pepper , and tylenol and it seems to work although a haven to seen a doctor about this allergic reaction guess for my past problems . the reason why a am asking now is because a few days ago a stupidly ate something with cayenne pepper in it and had another fainting spell without having had any problems for a long time . a noticed that the symptoms were the same but extremely intense this time around and a few hours later a noticed that my right eye felt itchy . when a rubbed it slightly a felt a sudden burning sensation that quickly went away . a immediately rushed to the bathroom mirror and noticed that the skin surrounding my eye was pitch black , as if a had a really bad black eye . a don to remember having hit my face as my face did to feel sore after i fainted . the after affects after the faint lasted all day this time and out of curiosity a took my temperature and it read 95.2 degrees a ( oral ) . thinking this low a decided to have a hot bath . after sitting in the bath for about a few minutes the nausea suddenly intensified and a spontaneously began to vomit multiple times . for some reason the bath made me really sick . anyway a a committed to stay clear of cayenne pepper and be more careful in the future , but the reason why a wanted to ask a doctor about this now was because a wanted to know if you think a should have an pipe on hand . a was a little afraid as to how much more intense the symptoms were after having not had them for so long . a was wondering if you think a should get checked out again or if there is really no way to definitively confirm such an allergy . also , from what a read barley , cayenne pepper , and tylenol allergies are rare and also a don to experience every common allergy symptom . to a was wondering if you think a was wrong about this being an allergy or if this is indicative of some other type of unusual condition . a just did to want to waste my time and money seeing another doctor about this again since a was to sure if there was going to be anything also they could test or do for me other than to advice staying clear of those foods for which a already know .",3,112162,thanks for your question on chat doctor. treatment of pleurisy is depending on cause. there are many causes for pleurisy. but the most common ones are1. pneumonia. 2. tb3. pleural effusion.4. pulmonary contusions. so better to get done chest x-ray and start treatment accordingly. if chest x-ray is normal than possibility of muscular pain is more. try to follow these for muscular pain.1. avoid heavy weight lifting.2. avoid strenuous exercise. 3. take good painkillers and muscle relaxant. 4. avoid bad postures in sleep.5. apply warm water pad to the affected site

"my nephew is 21years old ... he was having back ache for 2-3years now ... it increased so much that he was taking 2-3 pain killers in a day ... fri result showed some shadow around spine area .... surgery was conducted in delhi hospital ... biopsy result shows no tuberculosis and no tutor .... but tissue growth is there and doctors have taken out 50-60. , % of tissues .. patient is relieved but no clear diagnosis could be done ... problem might reoccur doctors have to say ... what is your opinion",1,22523,"hi, thanks for writing in. there is a bit of confusion in your statement. it is not clear if the path reports consistently said it was a liposarcoma. mri is a good investigation tool for tumors and shows the size, location, infiltration and any associated structural involvement. the path reports are confirmatory and always have to be matched with the mri results. if path reports say it was malignant then there is no other way to tell that it isn't one. in view of what is written above and considering that the path reports were altered subsequently, the appearance of a new tumor in the area requires ct or mri scan and an image guided biopsy from the active region of the tumor. this is essential to know if there is a locally aggressive process going on and if it should be treated. the pain can be due to nerve entrapment by the tumor and that must also be looked in to. a biopsy is the final confirmation in your case. there is no need to get scared as it can also be a focus of chronic infection in the operated area. please do not worry."

my son is three months old he has these circle patches of raised bumps on the back of his legs and arms . they are the color as the rest of his skin and he does to have a fever . as just wondering what they may be . a give him a bath every night and put regular baby lotion on him .,1,90927,"hi, i am chat doctor. i have read your message. i think i can help you. first, the symptoms that you have described are highly suggestive of seizures. here is why- 1. they come in night-seizures are commonly triggered when the patient sleeps or just around the sleep. of course, they can occur at other times too.2. they start from the leg and move up and then spread to the rest of the body.3. the episodes last 3-4 minutes and then resolves. i assume (you have not mentioned it) that it is never remembered by him, the episode that is. i think you should both take it very seriously. there is a high possibility that there is an intracranial problem that he is having which is extending and progressing undetected in the brain just because you do not want to visit a neurologist. i think you should meet a neurologist as soon as possible and request an mri brain (with spectroscopy if needed) and video eeg. if he does turn out to have a pathology, treatment will have to be initiated for the pathology in addition to regular anti-epileptic medicines. i suggest taking a video of these episodes that he is having. it may help convince him that he needs to visit a doctor, and it may be helpful to the doctor in seeing the condition that your husband has. yes, you need to visit a neurologist as soon as possible. ideally, i would also like to know if he has been having headaches for the past years? does he seem to be having episodes where he does not recollect what he has been doing for a certain duration of time? you may need to talk to his colleagues at work and find out if he has been having seizures or any abnormal behavior at work. there is a high chance that he knows that he has been having seizures at work and not telling you about it. i have tried my best to help you. unfortunately, i cannot initiate / suggest medicines as long as the diagnosis is not confirmed because the anti-epileptics may have severe side effects. best of luck,"

hi in a medical marijuana smoker and live been smoking marijuana everyday for about a year and live recently found a small dime size lump maybe smaller under the right side of my jaw . live had it for maybe a month and a half it hast gotten any bigger and i can move it around a little bit and it doesn't hurt . what could this be ? one side of my family has a history of lung and mouth cancer,1,13974,"hello! thank you for asking on chat doctor! your symptoms seem to be related to cardiac tachyarrhythmia, induced from marijuana. marijuana smoking can lead to marked increase in heart rate, lesser increases in supine blood pressure and frequent occurrence of postural hypotension. the latest would explain the feeling of fainting. on the one hand, these effects seem to be dose dependent, but on the other hand, the frequent use over a relatively short period of time results in tolerance. this means that after smoking regularly for some time, your body gets used to marijuana effects and you don't experience such symptoms when smoking marijuana anymore. but, i would recommend consulting with a gp for a careful physical examination, a resting ecg, a chest x-ray and some blood lab tests (complete blood count, thyroid hormone levels, blood electrolytes, fasting glucose, etc.), to rule out any possible underlying conditions. meanwhile, i would advise you to avoid smoking marijuana, because of these side effects on your cardio-vascular system and other side effects on different body organs. it can lead to tolerance (you need high doses to have the same effect) and addiction (you can't live without that). hope to have been helpful! best wishes,"

"a have pain in the my left testicle right on the tip where , a think it feels like a small tube is connected to it . it has a slight ache but it doesn't appear to be swollen that a can see . a have been reading about testicular torsion but it not an unbearable pain .",1,35811,"dear user, thanks for your question. there may be a few possibilities1 epididymis cyst. these are the small cysts (fluid-filled sacs) that can appear in the epididymis, usually cause no discomfort or pain. usually, the doctor can diagnose it clinically, but sometimes an ultrasound may be needed to confirm the cyst. they are left alone if not infected, very big (which need needle aspiration of fluid in it), or painful. rarely they may need removal by operation if causing suspicion or trouble.2 spermatocyte: this is a cyst which feels like an epididymis cyst, but it is filled with sperm (semen). again managed conservatively most of the time.3 varicocele: this is like varicose veins of the small veins next to one testicle (testis) or both testes. it is usually described as feeling as a wriggling bag of worms. this is managed with surgery mostly, after preliminary investigations to see what's causing pressure on the testicular veins. 4 lipoma: this is a fatty lump which can sometimes cause difficulty because it can be felt separate from the testis, just like an epididymis cyst. so i suggest if it is soft and doesn't increase in size, you can wait for the appointment. just keep an eye on it. do write back if there are any more concerns. thanks"

hello there i got a breast pain and i have a 2 lump in my breast both are movable one lump is small and that lump is causing pain to me . and i got shoulder pain neck pain and hand .. is this breast cancer symptoms ? of i press the brest i got little bit discharge just like milk a i am 22 yrs old,1,107693,"hi, welcome to chat doctor. based on the information provided by you, the breast lump could be a fibroadenoma or fibrotic disease. fibroadenoma is benign swelling which moves freely with in the breast tissue and is usually pains and often requires no treatment. fibrotic disease is usually seen in women in their 30s and present as a painful mass which does not move freely in breast tissue. it presents as pain during menstruation (cyclical nostalgia). you have not mentioned anything about pain in the swelling during menstruation. the possibility of fibrotic disease can be ruled out as you are 22 and you don't have any pain. so, the breast lump you have is a fibroadenoma. fnac does not remove the swelling. fnac is a test where some sample of the lump is taken through the needle and tested to know what type of swelling. evian capsules contain vitamin e and you can take them without any doubt. you need no special precautions and just stop worrying. please get the fnac done and if it turns out to be fibroadenoma, you do not need any surgery. surgery in fibroadenoma is required only when the lump is too big and causes mass effects. hope you got my point. take care"
hello there i got a breast pain and i have a 2 lump in my breast both are movable one lump is small and that lump is causing pain to me . and i got shoulder pain neck pain and hand .. is this breast cancer symptoms ? of i press the brest i got little bit discharge just like milk a i am 22 yrs old,2,82366,"hello friend, thank you for posting your query through chat doctor. i am a homeopath answering your query and the answer which i am going to give you may contain several thoughts which may appear strange or new for you. this i say because homeopathy is a new system of medicine and is almost unheard by the majority of the population. therefore, due to the high influence of the conventional medicine the people at large are brainwashed to believe and act according to the health education given by them. coming back to the fibroadenoma of your left breast in the year 1979, you had a psychological conflict in the mind level. you are a sensitive individual and that is why your left breast was affected. it must have been related with your child chat doctor. the sensitivity is genetic, and you reacted to the conflict through the brain according to a genetic programming. mind-brain - organ affection resulted in the development of a lump in your left breast in 1979. you consulted your gynecologist, and he suggested that it may turn to become cancerous in future and so it is better to remove it, and you subdued to his suggestion. actually the lump in the breast was an attempt of the body to cure you, or it was the result of a self defense mechanism. since you had not resolved the conflict in the psychological level, the lump remained there without getting resolved. but the body kept the lump protected in a cyst with minimum amount of inflammation called chronic cystitis. by removing the fibroadenoma or chronic cystic mastitis, you were not cured, but your lump in the breast was removed. in 1995 also you are the same person, you are the same sensitive person, and you underwent another more serious psychological conflict and the same left breast was again affected in a more serious manner. instead of recognizing the mass as a defense mechanism, you got the fear in you that you have cancer. the tissue changes also suggested that there is more serious pathology, and they labelled your lump this time as cancer and suggested removal of your left breast. if you could have recognized the lump as a defense mechanism and if you had no fear of cancer, you could have retained your breast. but the fear of cancer is such that it is associated with death and so you lost your breast. in no case, either by removal of lump in 1979 or by removal of your breast in 1995, you are not cured only your disease is cured. hope by this time you have got the answer for your query. both are related to each other because they are in the same individual, same sensitivity, same program. homeopathy cures the person and once the individual is cured all his diseases will be cured. with best wishes,"
hello there i got a breast pain and i have a 2 lump in my breast both are movable one lump is small and that lump is causing pain to me . and i got shoulder pain neck pain and hand .. is this breast cancer symptoms ? of i press the brest i got little bit discharge just like milk a i am 22 yrs old,3,80686,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. is understandable to be nervous about having a lump in your breast at any age. you are correct in your knowledge that breast cancer under the age of 30 is extraordinarily rare, however any lump in the breast that is present for more than short period of time really should be evaluated. it is not recommended that mammograms be performed in women who are breast-feeding because the calcium in your milk can sometimes cause abnormalities on the mammogram that mimic cancer. however, ultrasound, a diagnostic test similar to that which are baby got while you are pregnant, can be performed on your breast to see if the lump is the cyst, or a solid mass. a specialist in diseases of the breast would be a reasonable person to see for this evaluation if your gun doctor is not willing or able to properly examine you and refer you for the ultrasound. however, i do want to reassure you that most palpable lumps found in women who are pregnant or breast-feeding are due to some clogging or other issues of the milk glands and are rarely associated with cancer. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was reassuring. best wishes and good luck,"

by 20 year old grand daughter has had 3 episodes of rapid heart beat and breathlessness . the said shes had it before but only periodically and not in a cluster . that could cause this . the says shes not under undue stress right now.e mail yyyy @ yyyy,1,109169,"hi there there are a lot of things to explain in this but ill try to explain you in short so that you can understand. heart has two sides right and the left, right side of the heart receives used blood that returns from the body parts and right ventricles pump this blood to lungs to supply it with oxygen again and to make it reusable to the tissues now this oxygenated blood is returned from the lungs to left heart which pumps it back to whole body. that's how circulation is completed. now coming to your sons case, right ventricle (rv) can dilate due to various reasons and we summaries them in two scenarios pressure and volume overload. pressure overload happens when there is some sort of resistance in the normal blood flow as some lung pathology and volume overload is due to extra amount of blood entering the right side of the circulation from some abnormal pathway like some congenital heart defect or some valve incompetency of right heart. your son had episodes of chest pain which is not a good sign, he probably needs a bilateral lower limb doppler to rule out any sort of blood clot which could have embolized from there to heart and lungs leading to pain and a dialed rv and murmur. good luck"

"a am a 35 year old woman who has just recently found a lump inside of the rectum . it is located really far in , towards the colon . it has already been confirmed that it is not a hemmorhoid . there is no localized pain at the site of the lump . it has doubled in size in the last 4 months . a have a cat scan scheduled as far as diagnostics goes . it a eating at me a a like an opinion .",1,33931,"hi michele jacobi the first thing that has to be done once you find a lump in the region of the chest wall is to confirm what it is. in your case a biopsy has already been done and let us await its result. you're understanding that cancerous lumps don't bleed after biopsy is correct. but i think your presumption that if it was scar tissue it would have bled is not correct. scar tissue also need not bleed. needle biopsies do not usually cause any bleeding unless a blood vessel is ruptured during the procedure since how long have you noticed this lump. is the size of the lump increasing ? if the biopsy comes as positive for cancer then you will have to undergo a series of investigation to find out he the extent of the disease. ? whether it is confined to the chest wall only or whether it has gone beyond the chest wall to other regions. treatment decision will depend on the results of this if the biopsy comes as negative for cancer then there are 2 options 1- if your physician thinks it is insignificant then you need to follow it up. just keep a check on your lump to see whether it is increasing in size and also get it checked by your physician regularly2- the second option (and my preference) is to do an open biopsy especially if the lump was detected recently and is increasing in size and also if the lump is firm to hard (and not very soft). the reason is needle biopsy can be negative, but this does not always mean there is no cancer especially if the tissue sample taken is not adequate. also time factor is important. you may lose time keeping the lump under follow up to see whether it is increasing in size hope you are satisfied with my reply. anyway don't worry. follow your doctors' advice chat doctor."

hi in 33 weeks and right now in having bad lower back pains with abdominal pain what can i do or what does this mean ?,3,104162,"hi, thanks for writing in. if your daughter had a kidney infection 12 days back then it was a recent event. kidney infections take time for recovery and cause symptoms like pain in the lower back, burning urination, pain and bleeding in urine and lower abdominal pain with fever. however, every symptom is not found in each patient, and it is important to know what are the symptoms your daughter is having regularly. kidney infections are caused by bacteria and sometimes a bacterium cannot be controlled with an antibiotic. this is to be clarified with her tests and if required then a change of antibiotics will treat the infection completely. if in doubt, you can request your doctor to repeat the kidney function tests at regular intervals. imaging investigations like ultrasound scan or ct scan abdomen can help if the symptoms persist after treatment changes. please do not worry."

hi ! a am of man ... my height is 5.9 and my weight is 56kg ... a am getting weak day by day ... my face is getting weaker and my check bones are prominent ... a had the liver function test and total bilirubin is high about 1.5 mg/dl i cant gain weight .. am physiological getting ill ... a am very worried about my body .. can it be due to hyperbilirubia ?,1,65018,"hi thanks for the question. i assume that your baby is more than a week old. most of the babies have yellow discoloration of skin and sclera during the first few days of life. this is called physiological jaundice, and it subsides on its own without any intervention. this is a normal phenomenon as a result of transition from fetal to extrauterine life. you should be aware when jaundice is a cause of concern: 1. if jaundice appears on first day of life2. if the level of bilirubin is more than 12 mg/dl. bilirubin is the substance that causes the yellow coloration of skin. its level can be checked with a blood test .3. if the rise in bilirubin level is more than 5 mg/dl/hr. for this your doctor my prescribe repeated test and then plot the levels on a graph to predict the expected rise in bilirubin.4. if direct bilirubin is more the 2 mg/dl or 20% of the total. bilirubin is of two types physiological jaundice is due to the water insoluble indirect bilirubin so if direct component is high it means it's not physiological and should be a cause for concern. the direct and indirect breakage is given in the blood test. 5. if your baby is otherwise unwell e.g. is lethargic, is not feeding well, has fever or difficulty breathing then its not physiological jaundice because in that case your baby will be otherwise totally ok. you have asked if your baby needs incubator care. incubators are for premature babies who can not maintain their body temperatures as they have arrived earlier, and temperature control mechanisms have not yet been established. the incubator provides specific temperature. incubators are not used for the treatment of any type of jaundice. phototherapy is used for that. these are specially lights that convert the indirect water insoluble bilirubin into water soluble forms that can then be excreted out through urine. as i have told high levels of direct bilirubin are a cause of concern and these need treatment with a phototherapy unit. your doctor may prescribe phototherapy if your child has any of the criteria i have mentioned earlier, but incubator care is not needed as your baby is not premature and is at least older than a week. if you have any other questions i will be happy to answer."

"i a be had 3 lumps on the back of my thigh for a don to know how long a just noticed them a month ago and they haven to changed in size , they only appear when a flex but when a a not flexing it seems to disappear , a also want to note that a a 16 and very athletic a play soccer nearly every day , a be searched up what it could be and a think its either lipoma or muscle knot .",1,21962,"dear simone, there is one rule for doctors here in croatia: when you think too much, stop, and think again, but this time think for the simplest diagnose. if you have pain in abdomen and an umbilical hernia seen on us then the first thing to think about is ""abdominal pain caused by hernia"":). there are many conditions in medicine where pain doesn't need to beau localized near the ""pathology"". sometimes pain can be felt on the opposite side of the affected organ. it is known that one of common symptom of myocardial infarction is pain in the left shoulder. also, infection of the abdominal organs can give many types and localizations of pain. the reason for it is simple: when i see pain, i see nerves, not organs (this is my own phrase:)). nerves conduct pain, and nerves are all around, going from periphery to the brain, so pain can be localized on its pathway, so just let's go back to your problem. doctor should tell you the size of hernia and its content which can be only preperitoneal tissue, momentum or even intestines. this dark triangle...mmm.it can be nothing and everything. i usually don't trust our ultrasonographer because they are strange people... sometimes they don't see what they need to see, or they see what they don't need to see. all i see is that us is operator-dependent diagnostic test... but we shouldn't underestimate this finding. it can be uterine moma, endometriosis, cyst or tumor. and yes, it can cause pain you're describing. so what you need to do: 1. ct scan of pelvic and abdominal region. why? as i said, these us findings are always doubtful, ct is a high sensitive test which will find the exact problem for sure. it will tell you the size and severity of hernia and the morphology of this uterine lesion. it can also find some other problems in its early phase."

"i , i suffer from high blood pressure but a am not taking any medication at the moment . by alcohol intake have increased and a am suffering from stress . a noticed recently that my chest gets flushed or red very easily and sometimes a have difficulty breathing",3,26625,"hi, brief answer: very elevated blood pressures will generally require long term management with blood pressure medications. the risks of stroke heart attack, and kidney failure from untreated high blood pressure greatly outweighs the risks from taking the blood pressure medication. detailed answer: blood pressure measures the force at which blood pushes on the wall of the blood vessels. high blood pressure (hypertension) is a very common condition. high blood pressure puts stress on the heart and can cause the heart to fail and cause heart attacks. high blood pressure in the brain can lead to a stroke or cause bleeding in the brain. high blood pressure can also damage the kidney. to reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke, or kidney failure, high blood pressure needs to be treated. treatment of high blood pressure includes lifestyle changes like eating a well-balanced heart healthy diet, exercising regularly, stress reduction, losing weight if overweight, chat doctor. very high blood pressure (or stage 2 hypertension), like your sons, can require two or more (sometimes up to four) blood pressure medications to get under control. there are single pills that actually contain a combination of blood pressure medications, so that would make taking medication a bit easier for your son. all medications have side effects and risks. blood pressure medications can cause the blood pressure to become to low and cause lightheadedness, dizziness, and nausea. some medications can cause imbalance of electrolytes like sodium and potassium. however, these risk from taking medications are far outweighed by both the benefit of treating high blood pressure on overall health in the long-term and by the risk of not treating high blood pressure. appropriately treating high blood pressure has been shown to greatly reduce risk of heart failure, heart attack, stroke, and death. i would encourage you and your son talk to his doctor about his blood pressure medications and options to reduce the number of pills that he is prescribed. hope i have answered your question. let me know if i can assist you further."

"by baby is has german , half african ( lightskinned ) . tomorrow she will be a week old . by concern is that she is more red in complexion than white or brown . is this normal , and if so , what is the medical reason behind this ? is it some kind of burning of the skin ?",1,65018,"hi thanks for the question. i assume that your baby is more than a week old. most of the babies have yellow discoloration of skin and sclera during the first few days of life. this is called physiological jaundice, and it subsides on its own without any intervention. this is a normal phenomenon as a result of transition from fetal to extrauterine life. you should be aware when jaundice is a cause of concern: 1. if jaundice appears on first day of life2. if the level of bilirubin is more than 12 mg/dl. bilirubin is the substance that causes the yellow coloration of skin. its level can be checked with a blood test .3. if the rise in bilirubin level is more than 5 mg/dl/hr. for this your doctor my prescribe repeated test and then plot the levels on a graph to predict the expected rise in bilirubin.4. if direct bilirubin is more the 2 mg/dl or 20% of the total. bilirubin is of two types physiological jaundice is due to the water insoluble indirect bilirubin so if direct component is high it means it's not physiological and should be a cause for concern. the direct and indirect breakage is given in the blood test. 5. if your baby is otherwise unwell e.g. is lethargic, is not feeding well, has fever or difficulty breathing then its not physiological jaundice because in that case your baby will be otherwise totally ok. you have asked if your baby needs incubator care. incubators are for premature babies who can not maintain their body temperatures as they have arrived earlier, and temperature control mechanisms have not yet been established. the incubator provides specific temperature. incubators are not used for the treatment of any type of jaundice. phototherapy is used for that. these are specially lights that convert the indirect water insoluble bilirubin into water soluble forms that can then be excreted out through urine. as i have told high levels of direct bilirubin are a cause of concern and these need treatment with a phototherapy unit. your doctor may prescribe phototherapy if your child has any of the criteria i have mentioned earlier, but incubator care is not needed as your baby is not premature and is at least older than a week. if you have any other questions i will be happy to answer."

"i need an urgent reply about this . . . by period was due two days ago but did to show up . by period is kind of irregular though and shows up maybe a few days late sometimes . thing is , two days ago a also got intimate with my partner . be had genital contact but no penetration , however a lot of semen dripped onto my thigh and near my vagina entry . a a afraid that while washing the area a may have pushed some in instead and am now considering taking an emergency contraceptive pill ( which a just bought at a pharmacy ) as a be read online that sperm near the entry of the vagina can in fact make its way to the fallopian tubes and can even stay alive for up to a week . however , today a see pink discharge spotting and am expecting that my period is arriving . is it possible for me to have my period if a got pregnant ? should a take the contraceptive pill or not ? this would be my first time and a haven to had penetrative sex yet . please help , thanks .",1,37527,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. even though your boyfriends penis was inside you for only a short time, sperm can be present in pre-ejaculate (or pre-cum) and if you truly do not want to become pregnant it is really important to avoid any contact of the penis with your vagina during sexual play. the most fertile time of a woman cycle is in the middle, typically 14 days before your menstrual period would be due. so the time from when your period finishes until you start to feel pms symptoms is your fertile time. so in this case, since your boyfriend did not ejaculate, it still would be quite rare for you to have conceived. the most common sign of pregnancy is a late or delayed menstrual period. so in your case, you just need to wait for your period to arrive, and if it is late, you can do an over-the-counter urine pregnancy test which is greater than 99% accurate. pregnancy test do not become positive however until at least 2 to 3 weeks after conception. so in summary, your chances of having gotten pregnant in your particular situation is very, very low. for the future, please make sure that the penis is completely covered with a condom if it has any contact with the opening of your vagina. as long as the area is moist, sperm can swim all the way up your vagina from the opening and result in pregnancy. however, the amount of sperm in pre-cum is extremely low, so again i doubt that you need to be concerned about this one sexual encounter. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was helpful. best wishes,"

"a had diarrhoea 2 weeks ago , for the whole week along with stomach pains indicating that i needed to `` go '' . last week there was no sign of diarrhoea . by diarrhoea started acting up again yesterday after i ate taco bell . now ( today ) i have severe stomach pains and the urge to go , but i am not able to go . a am also very gassy . it seems that about an hour or so after i eat a meal i start to feel sick and feel the need to go .",1,12353,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. unfortunately, being pregnant does not prevent you from getting sick just like any other person. fortunately, you have to have very severe and/or certain types of illnesses to put the baby at risk. a low-grade fever and some nausea likely is just a stomach flu or some type of food-borne illness and does not pose a threat to the pregnancy. i suggest you start a bland diet with simple, starchy foods and sweet liquids. products made from ginger (tea, candies) are soothing to the stomach and can help with nausea, and acetaminophen (tylenol) is safe to take at the normal adult dose during pregnancy for pain or fever.also, if you are sick, there is no problem with getting the routine prenatal blood tests as the results are not affected by your illness. i hope i was able to answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy, and i hope you feel better,"

a have had quad bypass and after 9 months those became blocked and stents were placed in the original clogged arteries . a have had on and off chest pain for 4 years . over the last 2 yrs have not been able to work . would this qualify me as disabled ?,2,28983,"hello. thank you for your question and welcome to chat doctor. i carefully read your query. first, i believe that you know what does a chest pain originated from coronary arteries feel like. this is called angina, and is more like a severe heaviness or tightness in the mid-chest and which spreads to the left arm. sharp pain with the highest probability does not reflect a pain originated from a blockage in the coronary arteries. on the stent side, since it has been seven years you underwent stent implantation, i assume that the stents are patent and working well, since the highest probability for them to narrow is within 6 to 12 months after implantation, depending on from the stent placed. however, once you had coronary artery disease, although treated at that time, you have an independent risk factor to develop coronary artery disease again. i would recommend you to undergo a cardiac stress test, based on the above-mentioned fact, and the strain you felt in your heart area. as for the sharp pain in your left arm, my opinion is that it is not connected to coronary arteries. i hope i was of help. kind regards."
