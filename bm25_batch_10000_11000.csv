"now can a get relief from the sore spot - a small crater like hole above the teeth gum ? a have a sore spot in my far upper right gum ( above the teeth gum . ) a just discovered that its actually a small crater like hole . about the size of pen point . a be had a sore throat for the 2 weeks especially at night and that spot has been very sore for about some days now , and also i am starting to feel pain there",1,106915,"hi. thanks for the query. a sore spot in the gum can be due to injured gum in that area. it can cause inflammation and soreness of gum and at times formation of an abscess. it can occur due to tooth brush injury, any hard food, foreign body or food particle impaction in the gum etc. so for now you can apply chlorhexidine ointment over the gum. apply lidocaine gel to reduce pain. do warm saline gargles and antiseptic mouthwash gargles. in case if there is no improvement consult an oral physician and get evaluated. localised cleaning and a short course of antibiotics can help in improving. hope this helps. regards."

(we call this osmosis phenomenon). for this effect, we need to check the blood sugar at midnight around 2am or so. if this midnight glucose level is very low, then we have to decrease your night insulin levels. therefore, the best for you is to go immediately to your treating doctor and adjust the insulin dose you are taking. regards"

"last menstrual period start january first having abdominal pain and lower rob pain went to of yesterday , chatdoctor level of 276 had vaginal and abdominal ultrasound that showed cysts on ovaries and small amount of fluid in jul de sac no intrauterine pregnancy a have had no bleeding should a be concerned that it is ectopic still ?",1,79212,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. so, if you had a positive pregnancy test and did the test correctly, you should be pregnant. however, if there is no gestational sac visible on the ultrasound there are a few possibilities of what may be going on. first, the pregnancy may just be too small and early to see on an ultrasound. that can be normal if your period is only a week late. secondly, the pregnancy may not be growing a fetus, which is a kind of miscarriage (called a ""chemical pregnancy"") that gives you a positive test without development of a fetus. most people with this condition will eventually start bleeding and pass the pregnancy. the third possibility, which is the most concerning, is that your pregnancy is located outside your uterus. this is called an ectopic pregnancy. the most common site for an ectopic pregnancy is in the fallopian tube. the problem with a tubal pregnancy is that, as the fetus grows, the tube is not designed to expand, and it actually can burst, resulting in severe internal bleeding and even a risk of death for the mother. because of this, it is extremely important that you be closely followed by a physician for the early part of your pregnancy. you first need a blood level of your pregnancy hormone taken and then repeated along with another ultrasound in a few days. the hormone level should double every 48 hours in a normal pregnancy, and furthermore, if the hormone level is high and there is no visible intrauterine pregnancy then it is very suspicious for a tubal pregnancy. signs and symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy include spotting, abdominal pain (especially if it is only on one side), and sometimes right shoulder pain. dizziness, shortness of breath and fast heartbeat may indicate internal bleeding. if you have any of these symptoms, you should go to an emergency room for evaluation or call an ambulance. so in summary-when you have a positive pregnancy test with an ultrasound that does not show an intrauterine pregnancy, you need to be ruled out for an ectopic pregnancy. a blood pregnancy hormone level (called a bchatdoctor) should be done first, and depending on the result your doctor will be able to determine what is going on with your pregnancy and determine the best course of action. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

33yo male . had myocardial infraction 2 months ago . main started in upper back and was diagnosed as pericarditis . 2 days later chest pain then heart attack diagnosis . a am having upper back pain again about 3 of 10 on a pain scale . should a go back to the hospital or just schedule a normal app,1,1409,"pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium with occasional pericardial effusion. about 90% of the causes are unknown. most people will have viral type symptoms such as fever, myalgic, and malaise. pericarditis can also cause cute, sharp, stabbing chest pain that can last hours to days. some people will also get shortness of breath and pain with breathing. i am assuming you had a pretty extensive work up before being diagnosed with pericarditis. the work up should've included blood work with inflammatory markers and cardiac markers, as well as ekg changes. the first line treatment is usually ibuprofen several times daily for about two weeks. there are other anti-inflammatories that work just as good if you cannot tolerate ibuprofen. steroids are actually a second line treatment but work just as good as ibuprofen. generally, about 7 to 10 days of ibuprofen can significantly decrease your symptoms and pericarditis. you should also get plenty of rest. some people have will have recurrent pericarditis. you should also have an ultrasound of your heart to make sure there is no fluid around the heart. if you do not get better with ibuprofen in 10 days, i would recommend having a further work up to make sure you do not have my own pericarditis which involves the heart muscle."

my nephew ( a 40 year old in good health until now ) has been diagnosed with sarcoidosis he was treated with predizone but treatment has not been successful . his symptoms have continued.are there other treatments available ? a friend also a doctor suggested he may want to get on a waiting list for a heart/lung transplant ... is that something to be considered ?,1,90747,"hi, thanks for writing in. many people end up with a second cancer with a history of having been treated for an earlier cancer with radiation therapy. however, at that time, providing radiation therapy had more benefits and risks and has helped in treating the testicular cancer and your husband has been free from symptoms almost 25 years. plasma cell dysplasia can be seen in such patients but saying with confirmation that it is indeed the radiation that is responsible is difficult. radiation effects are both dose dependent and non dose dependent. if your husband was exposed to radiation in error at his workplace then things would have been different but in the present case he has been given radiation therapy as a treatment and that has been successful to a certain extent. there are also patients who develop a second cancer that is unrelated to the first cancer. to know the chances of the prior radiation treatment causing the plasma cell dysplasia, all his medical records have to be verified and that will only give a risk. it cannot be said with certainty that the radiation given 25 years back is completely responsible for his present health condition."

"i , may a answer your health queries right now ? please type your query here ... my brother is advised to do the bypass surgery by next month . be has a 90 % block in his artery.another block was there in a major vessel . but it was cleared by an angioplasty . by question is that before doing the surgery will the of do any test to confirm that whether the blocks are still there or not.so many people are praying for him.so we hope that god might have done the mirracle.except angiogram any other test is there to confirm the block .",1,95,"hello thank you for posting here. i have gone through your description. since he has two blocks in the heart arteries, and he is advice bypass, the right choice is to go ahead with bypass surgery. i don't know any therapy named kelley, but i suppose you are talking about ch elation therapy. this therapy is of no benefit for the patient. the blocks in the heart artery are embedded inside the heart vessel and any amount of medication or therapy cannot decrease it to make it vanish. medications can only help to stop progression of the block. definitive way to treat critical heart blockages is an angioplasty or bypass surgery. had you been my patient my advice would be to go ahead with bypass? bypass surgery requires a stay of 7- 10 days approx in the hospital. patient can start walking usually by day 5 after surgery. it requires a recovery period of 20 -25 days, but the long term results of bypass are very good with patients having a good quality of life. gastric ulcers can be treated with long term antacids. gastric ulcers are not a contraindication for surgery. wishing you good health thank you"

"a was prescribed the vilest contraceptive pill about 5 weeks ago , the first cycle was fine , but now that i have started my second pack a am experiencing what a think are heart palpation roughly every 10minutes . is this because of the tablet ? should a stop taking it ?",1,11579,when was your last period? there are many choices for pill initiation. what the pharmacist at pharmacy has told is one such method. it is called quick start method. you can start taking pills on any day of the cycle as long as you are sure that there are no chances for pregnancy. but with this method you should use back up contraception like condom for diaphragm for the first seven days. please note that with this method your census will be delayed until you complete active pills in the pack. starting contraceptive pills on the first day of cycle is another choice of starting the pill. first day of cycle means first day of normal menstrual flow. when you start taking contraceptive pill on the first or second day of cycle there is no need to use back up contraception. i hope i have answered to your satisfaction.
"a was prescribed the vilest contraceptive pill about 5 weeks ago , the first cycle was fine , but now that i have started my second pack a am experiencing what a think are heart palpation roughly every 10minutes . is this because of the tablet ? should a stop taking it ?",2,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

since having a root carnal treatment an a crown fitted the crown only lasted 6 mouths before fulling out my dentist placed in back in only for it to come out again and since he replaced it the star of the year in had four cysts in mouth should he of taken my tooth out by now ?,1,10813,"hi. welcome to chat doctor . i have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. as per your complaint if you have a temporary crown over your tooth since 2 weeks, and you still have pain it is not a normal finding and needs consultation with a dentist to rule out the cause of pain. as of now you can take advil [ibuprofen] for relieving pain rather that tylenol as advil is more effective in reducing pain and inflammation. i would like to give you additional information that if after 2 weeks also you have pain in the tooth with a temporary crown, you need to consult a dentist and get evaluated and also get an iop ar [x-ray] done to rule out the exact cause of pain. at times high points over the crown can be a cause of pain and trimming of the same can relieve the pain. other causes can be:if the tooth is root canal treated before crown placement there re-infection in the tooth can be a cause of pain and in that case removal of crown followed by repetition of root canal treatment followed by antibiotics and painkillers and replacement of crown will relieve. if root canal treatment was not done there is a possibility that while preparing the tooth to retain the crown there have been some nerve exposure and inflammation of nerve is causing pain. in this case root canal treatment has to be done after removing crown and then crown has to be replaced. hope this information helps. thanks and regards. chat doctor."

hi doctor .... i am suffering from palpitations since like four months .... a i experience them daily ... i done remember if i had a day that i dint experience this feeling ... i had all my tests a they are show nothing is wrong.only i have sinus tachycardia ... in not taking any medicines.i only want to ask a that do the palpitations lasts for this much long ? ? a if so what am i supposed to do ? ? ? thank u.waiting for or answer .. maria bite jail ..,1,88858,"hello and thank you for using chat doctor. i carefully read your question and i understand your concern. i will try to explain you something and give you some advises. as you describe my opinion is that we are dealing with a rhythm issue. someone might feel heart palpitations for different reasons. it may be a simple sinus tachycardia that means that the heart is beating regularly over 100 beats for minute. its normal resting rate is between 60-100 beat for minute. you may experience palpitations because of extra-sistolyc beats. these is electrical impulses generating from parts of the heart different from normal sinus rhythm. this gives the sensation of an escaped, skipping beat. but there are all sow different rhythm problems like atrial fibrillation ore supra ventricular tachycardia where the heart doesn't beat normal, it suddenly beats fast or in a chaotic way with very high frequencies and this might be what we call atrial fibrillation. my opinion is that lifting weight is not the reason of your palpitations. it's quite known in cardiology that during physical exertion the heart rate raises. its maximal frequency should go 220 minus your age, and it should slowly go down. but you describe a long history of palpitations and a sudden heart jumping just for some seconds, immediately chat doctor. so, i think that we should see what are these rhythm fluctuations. does this happen even in a resting situation or only when you exercise? if i was your treating doctor i will recommend a blood analyze, your thyroid hormones, an electrocardiography, echocardiogram and of course a holder monitoring to see your rhythm tendency. ones we have all these we can say what are these palpitations and how to treat them.these is all for a simple check-up to reduce these episodes in the future. whish i was helpful. take good care. best regards"

"i , ave been with my boyfriend over a year now , pm 18 . when we first started having sex a was on the pill . but that messed up my period , and made me constantly bleed none stop . to about 6 months into our relationship a stopped using contraception all together , so we have been having unprotected sex for 6 months now and a haven got pregnant does this mean a cant have children ?",1,15745,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. first, if you are late for your shot and have had unprotected sex, even if you are bleeding, you should do a urine pregnancy test. if your pregnancy test is negative, many women do not have regular periods come back after discontinuing the depo-provera injection for even up to 6 months. this, however, does not mean that you cannot become pregnant. if you are not actively trying to get pregnant, a good way to help regulate your cycles until your own body resumes a regular cycle is by taking birth control pills. birth control pills make you get a light, regular, predictable cycle every month and will help control breakthrough bleeding (the brown staining you have all the time). many women have irregular bleeding in the first 6 months to a year of using the shot, and unfortunately the same thing can happen after you discontinue it. so, in summary, all the irregular bleeding you are having is likely due to your discontinuing the demo shot. if you need contraception, the monthly cycle birth control pill would be a good option that can also help you have regular cycles. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

my dad is 70 yrs old had infection removed from prostate a month ago for last two weeks he has done nothing but urinate straight blood rarely it will be milky looking but mostly just blood had biopsy done on prostate came back negative but why is he urinating blood all the time ?,1,66445,"hello and thank you for asking chat doctor. i have read your symptoms and i understand your concerns. there is no correlation between an enlarged prostate and having unstable bp. your prostate will affect your bladder to empty itself when you urinate. also urinating frequently in a small amount is a symptom of an enlarged prostate. in prostatitis (infection of the prostate) there might be an increased blood pressure due to the pain or the anti-inflammatory meds that patients use, but usually this does not happen in healthy patients, that have no problems with the heart or the blood pressure. i suggest you check up with a cardiologist to treat your unstable blood pressure (he will ask for some test first before starting the treatment) and a check-up with an urologist for the enlarged prostate (other tests will be done here)-you will need blood test, liver function, kidney function-ultrasound of your urinary tract and of your heart-specific cardiac test and prostate tests. if you have other questions, feel free to ask me. chat doctor."

"a was on the pill called yaz i was on it for 3 months , a missed about 1 week and i had unprotected sex in that week . a started spotting so i stopped taking my pill and the bleeding stopped however i am still bleeding very few days , is there any chance i am peggy ? or has the pill confused my body ? a am having pains in my back , legs and belly my belly is tender to touch . please advise me . thankyou",1,27194,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. tri-sprintec is a birth control pill that has a traffic regimen; which means that each color pill in the package has a slightly different dose of hormones. occasionally, women who take traffic pills may have some spotting in the first few days after each pill strength changes over the course of the month. this may cause some slight bleeding or spotting when were not supposed to have your period. whenever you had vaginal bleeding, regardless of the cause, usually there is some cramping that accompanies it. furthermore, it is not unusual to have irregular bleeding or spotting in the first 3 months of pill use. both sprinter and tri-sprintec are considered low-dose birth control pills, however there are many brands on the market that have a lower dose of estrogen than the pill you are currently taking. so you may have less irregular bleeding and spotting on a different kind of monophasic (same dose all month) birth control pill. regarding pregnancy, the chance of your conceiving while taking birth control pills and using a condom is basically nonexistent. so i believe the symptoms you were experiencing are side effects due to the new birth control pill. if your desire is for lighter, regular periods, a different brand of monophasic pill may work better for you with fewer side effects. i hope i was able to adequately answer questions today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

hi doctor . when i was 15 years old one of my friend told me to masturbate . and i did it for certain time . than on the ere of self relegation i stored doing it . during the period i used to masturbate i did not had that month problem . as soon as i stopped.it started as usuall.but now i a about to get marriage and i have a doubt in my mind that will i be able to reproduce ? do answer my question ?,3,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

i my 10 year old son broke his first metatarsal bone playing footy on the weekend . be were not satisfied with the doctor we saw and was just interested in your opinion . all he said to us was does to look like it needs a pin stay off it for two weeks . nothing about follow up visit to check on it or anything . should he have some sort of support on it like moon boot or something ?,1,58987,"his am chat doctor. i have read your message. i think i can help you. first, a package test means that multiple tests are included that correlate to the test. cpk and spe can both be package tests as there are many related tests needed in a diagnosis. the symptoms that you seem to be facing as per the query is basically severe backache that increases on lying down or bending-in other words, anything that causes the spine to be under pressure. now she itself can cause the symptoms. the muscles and bone problems can arise in she itself and thus possibly one will feel that there is nothing more to do. however, in many situations, the doctors may get biased my a diagnosis. so, i think it is good that your doctor did not get biased with your pre-existing diagnosis of she and continued to look for other causes of backache. a severe backache can happen due to muscle disorders, a condition known as myopathy. the cause of myopathy may be she itself. the test commonly done to test myopathy is cpk or creatine phospholipase. this is a test done from blood. the idea is if the cpk is raised, it suggests myopathy. in this situation, your doctor will need to modify the therapy. i am unaware of your medication from the query. so i cannot really comment upon it. but some medicines themselves cause myopathy. and sometimes, the dose of existing medicines need to be stepped up for treatment of myopathy. so i presume your doctor wanted to check that. second test was spe or serum protein electrophoresis. this is one of the tests for multiple myeloma. this is a type of malignancy that affects the bones and causes bone pains and should be ruled out in middle-aged to elderly commonly if the backache is worsening and is specially bad when lying down. if the test is negative, there is nothing to worry about. if it does come out to be positive, multiple myeloma can be treated. so again you need not worry since the treatment is available. why the doctor did not tell you about the tests is something i can only speculate about. i guess it was because these are just doubts, considering you already have she- in medicine, the usual dictum is that one disease can explain the symptom, the other condition should not be sought. having said that, it's a folly to miss another diagnosis due to a pre-existing condition. i think he would have told you if the tests came out positive. so there should be nothing to worry about-the doctor was just making sure that there is no other problem. possibly since there was nothing else diagnosed, he did not tell you about it. i have tried to make it as simple as possible to understand the situation. in case there are still doubts, feel free to contact me for further details. best of luck,"

by daughter is 31 weeks . her back is hurting and she is cramping and have pain to the point that she has to stop what she is doing and sit on the floor and stretch . this is her 2nd child . should she call her physician ? would she be in premature labour ? her water has not broke .,1,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"a have a rash that is spreading . it is dark red and 3 are circles and one loops out of a circle and there are small spots around the area , is this ringworm because i had it on my shoulder before this rash on my thigh appeared or something more serious . is there any way to get a picture of it to you ?",1,54841,"hello. thanks for writing to us at chat doctor it is extremely difficult to be absolutely sure about it without having had the opportunity to examine. i will have to keep a few possibilities: it could either be a fungal infection or it could be intertwine (which is inflammation of the body folds). sweat and occlusive clothing predisposing to both of these conditions. if it is bilateral, it is more likely to be one of these. a unilateral rash such as this, goes more in favor of herpes zoster, specially if it is sore and painful. herpes zoster later on forms fluid filled lesions and is characteristically located on one side of the body. visual inspection would be the best way to determine the true nature of the rash and i would suggest that you visit a doctor for the needful. regards"

a had my lmp on 25 jul4 2014 . a had intercourse on 28 july a took a pill on next day . after 7 days of a pill a had bleeding per vaginally for 3-4 days . but till today means about 2 months completed & a haven menstrual periods . . please guide me ...,1,100885,"hallow madam, i hope i can be of help to you today. the due date of delivery (dd) is calculated by a formula dd= last menstrual period date (lmp) + 9 months + 7 days. since you had your lmp on 10 july 2010, the dd would be on 17 april 2011. if dd provided to you is by ultrasonography, a variation of one week is acceptable as ultrasonography calculated dd is by the size of the baby and is calculated from the date of conception. to calculate the date of egg release (ovulation), it happens 14 days before the next expected menses. so considering your menstrual cycle of 30 or 31 days, next menses would be on 10 august and ovulation would be on 28 july 2010. the life of an egg is 24 hours and the sperms are active for 72 hours. hence, a period of one week around the ovulation is fertile period. so your fertile period would be 24 july to 1 august. thus, the conception would be in that period. now in this calculation, you have to make some modifications depending on the periodicity of your menstrual cycle. then you can locate your fertile period of that cycle. thus, the intercourse(s) during this fertile period are likely to cause the pregnancy. if you had a solitary intercourse during fertile period, that day or within 4 days of that day would be the day of conception. of course this all is based on the clinical calculations. if you want to ascertain the paternity of your child for any legal cause, you may go for dna test which would be a foolproof evidence. i hope this helps you."

"ave had the implant for 1 year and 2 months with no bleeding whatsoever . recently i have been very ill with a chest infection and norovirus but in on antibiotics and recovering , about 2 days into my illness live saw spotting when i want to the toilet , now in heavily bleeding and got tummy pain this has been going in for 3-4 days now ! ( before the implant i hardly bled it was very light and only lasted 2-3 days ) ... why am i suddenly bleeding ?",1,86885,thanks for using chat doctor. read your query. bleeding and puss discharge associated with the tissue surrounding the implant suggests inflammation in the gums and presence of an abscess. if untreated can lead to destruction of the implant bone connection leading to the problems in the implant. medical conditions like diabetes and smoking habit will further worsen the condition. i would advise you to visit your dentist and have it reviewed. the inflammation and infection will usually be cleaned in the affected area and if needed antibiotics will be prescribed. maintain a good oral hygiene. have your implant routinely checked. hope this was useful. thanks and regards.

"i . a a 42 , been off of my birth control for 3 months now and we are not using any protection in hopes of getting pregnant . a have a 28 day cycle and my last period started may 12th , 2012 and ended may 19th 2012 . be had sex sunday night . by question is a two part question ... could a have gotten pregnant and what are the chances if he a 46 and we have not had sex in over 3-4 weeks ?",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"respected sir , i am 20 years old and during getting physical with my girlfriend i am not able to perform well . my penis is erect only for a very short period of time and i ejaculate very easily . help me sir what to do ? i used to masturbate daily and sometime 2-3times a day",1,36900,"hi, i guess your concern is wife not getting pregnant after 2 yrs of marriage, right? i got the picture what you are going through. don't worry i am here to help you sir. let's start discussing with the information you have shared with us. when you were a kid you got operated at penis. then heard the doctor saying you may not become a father. but sir what kind of operation it is? you haven't shared, or you may not be knowing as you were kid at that time. so cant say whether that operation is causing this problem. anyway let's keep this kid operation aside. you haven't shared how old is your wife? what her exact age is? is it a late marriage. if it's a late marriage then getting pregnant takes some time sir. have patience. women from 18-40 years of reproductive age group, the chances of pregnancy are high, after 50 years, chances of pregnancy are very less, and 42-45-transition zone, chances are not as high as reproductive age neither as less than after 50 years. you have to judge where wife stands, where? i would like to focus on the medical term-fertile period. it is from 10th-16th day of menses cycle where chances of becoming pregnant are very, very high. here sperm fertilizes ovum and women become pregnant, that's why it's called fertile period. well, with above discussion you can try out my suggestions:1. have patience, things will settle down slowly.2. i insist you and your wife to do sex in fertile period (mechanism i have told above). do this for next 6-8 months. you will get results by this time.3. if you are in a hurry, or you want to really know is that your kid operation is hindering you from becoming father, you can visit your nearby gynecologist or infertility specialist for sorting of things. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"hello sir , this is rates sir i am having skin allergy from 6 months .i have also done an allergy test , in that test various food and house dust are advised to be rid off.my physician have advised to take romilast l10.i have been taking it from last 2 months and 1months after 2 days interval but every 2nd day allergy occurs again sir ply advise what 2 do .",1,70120,"hello lisa, thank you for asking at chat doctor. there are two types of allergy tests - skin prick test (which you have been undergone) and serum tests (immunogen or last). i suggest you not to be worried by test results. these tests are not 100%. they only complement a clinicians decision about diagnosis of your food allergy. if you are demographic, skin testing will give you what we call false positives (means even if test is positive you are not allergic to it). so in a demographic person, skin testing is not a reliable test. so forget the results of skin test if you are demographic!! diagnosis of food allergy requires a very detailed history about your symptoms & your diet, right from very beginning when you had your first allergy symptoms. this requires a detailed consultation. after suspecting the foods you may be allergic to, you may be advised serum allergy tests to support the diagnosis. the best diagnosis of food allergy is by food challenge which is done at specialized allergy centers. i would suggest you to keep a food diary in which you can keep note of food taken (including ingredients) and every symptom you developed, with time & date. this will help you and your doctor to suspect what is it that may be causing symptoms. common food allergies are milk, wheat, peanut, tree nuts, soy, eggs, fish & shellfish. but one can be allergic to any other food substances from routine diet. also, i should tell you that there are other gastrointestinal disorders which may mimic food allergy and there is food intolerance (in simple words it means one cannot tolerate some foods) also. a gastroenterologist consultation would be helpful to you if you don't have food allergy. so i would suggest you not to think that you are allergic to all foods! also, i would suggest you to take an antihistamine (levocetirizine or cetirizine or fexofenadine) and montelukast daily to control your symptoms. wish you best of the health. regards."

"i was in a wreck when i was five weeks pregnant and it tore up my back , neck and shoulders so bad . now i am 30 weeks along and it hurts to breath . i do not want to take medication that will put the baby at risk . i am having contractions all day long so it makes the pain so much worse . this baby kicks so hard it feels like he is trying to rip his way out . the contractions are so strong in my belly but not yet down in the back or vaginal pressure . what is the safest way of delivery and when can i safely get him out ? my midwife says she needs to research it .",1,284,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. if your baby is in the head up position at term, it is not recommended that you deliver vaginally, because there is risk to the baby of birth injury. so if you reach your due date with your baby in the head up position, your obstetrician will likely recommend cesarean section. however, there is a possibility that the baby could turn around on its own. ways to help this to happen is to do what you can to let your belly hang to give the baby a chance to rollover. going on your hands and knees and arching your back high into the air, like an angry cat, for 10 minutes every day, can sometimes help the baby to turn around naturally. however, the best way to help the baby to turn around is for your obstetrician or midwife to perform a procedure called a version. in the us, versions, which literally are done by the doctor pushing the baby into a somersault is performed under ultrasound guidance in a hospital setting. it works about 50% of the time and can give a woman a chance at a normal vaginal delivery. regarding the cord around the babies neck, 15% of normally delivered infants have an umbilical cord around their neck. so the presence of the cord around the neck now does not mean that there will be any problems with labor and delivery if the baby is able to get into the right position. if you are considering having a version, i suggest that you speak to your delivering provider about it soon, as the success rates of version decrease significantly after 37 weeks. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and this information was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy and delivery,"

"i , a need to know the treatment for copd.the patient is 60 years old .chest scan result says almost 2/3rd of lungs is damaged.its status is very chronic . an you please let me know if it is curable , its medication and any hospital for treatment in india .",1,98885,"hello ! pulmonary fibrosis is a broad term. it can indicate a healed scar in the lung (most commonly due to treated tb in india) or it can indicate what is medically termed interstitial lung disease (old) . in the former (post infective fibrosis) it is not a progressive disease. the latter (old) encompasses about 200 different causes of fibrosis and it most cases it can be progressive. so the first thing that you should be asking your consultant is what variety of fibrosis your parent has got and what is the exact diagnosis. coz the treatment for various old is different. if there is any identifiable environmental or work related factor that has initiated the fibrosis then further avoidance of the factor is of utmost importance. for few varieties of old steroid works while in few it doesn't. so ask for the exact diagnosis, its extent of involvement in the lungs (whether localized or extensive, one lung or both the lungs), ask for what all investigations need to be done to find out what old your parent has got, discuss the current status, treatment options and prognosis. ask for any lifestyle change that you need to incorporate. some ids can be a manifestation of systemic disease so discuss whether it's the case in your parent, in which case the involvement of other organs also need to be investigated for in detail and treated."

( it looks like saliva , but it is thicker and slimmer . ) that is going on and what can a do ?",2,77258,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the sensation of feeling something stuck in your throat is a symptom of reflux-when the food that you eat or the acid in your stomach can back up and irritate it. this is common when you have a large belly at full term because your stomach is being pushed up towards your chest and also the hormones from the pregnancy cause the top opening of your stomach that connects to your esophagus to be looser, so food and acid can leak more easily. the best way to try to control this is to eat only small amounts at one time and to make sure you sit up for at least 2 hours after meals. taking antacids, which for the most part are all safe during pregnancy, can also help. trying to cough up what you feel in your throat will not help because there is not actually something solid coming up. these symptoms may be difficult to treat, but the good news is the symptoms will get better after you have the baby. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

"a have been trying to get pregnant for two months now . my period came on last month but it was light . a mostly bleed when i went to the bathroom . now a a having heart burn , sore breast and a milky discharge . the last test a took was negative . would a be pregnant",1,10535,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. pregnacare conception is simply a combination of vitamins that help a woman have a healthy pregnancy from conception. it has no hormonal effects and should not have any impact on the regularity of your cycle nor your ability to conceive, it is not unusual for women to bleed on and off for even 6 weeks after a miscarriage so the 19-day bleeding episode you had may not have actually been a menstrual period but still could have been bleeding leftover for your d and c. so you may not be ""late"" at all, but may just have not had a real period since the pregnancy. there is no reason to assume you would have problems getting pregnant again since you have conceived naturally twice in the last year. either way, the pregnancies conception vitamins have nothing to do with your irregular bleeding. it is generally advisable to wait to try to conceive again after your first real period-so i would wait until you bleed again to resume trying to conceive. if you do not get a real period by 3 months from your last bleeding episode, you should follow up for your gun for a re-evaluation of your hormones and treatment with progesterone, which can restart your period cycling. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful. best wishes,"

"a looked online to see if it is possible to get pregnant after your ovulation cycle . all i got was confusing answers . a have a regular 28 day cycle and ovulate 14 after my period . a had sex 5 days after my ovulation cycle , is it possible for me to be pregnant ?",1,52747,"hello, and i hope i can clarify this for you. you are absolutely correct in the fact that the length of your cycle is related to when you ovulate... and your ovulation date is 14 days back from when you got your period, rather than counting 14 days from the start of your period. it is typical for most women to have a 14-day luteal phase, as you suggested. you absolutely may ovulate later in your cycle. i do not know how long you and your partner have tried to conceive before trying closed. i would not recommend trying closed at all unless you have tried for a year (meaning unprotected sex at least 2-3 times per week) and not become pregnant. a reproductive endocrinologist is an appropriate referral if you have a history of infertility for one year, and if you fail at least 3 cycles of closed. they can prescribe closed and combine it with intrauterine insemination, which can increase the success rate. even though you may have had a child together before, there can be an issue with the male partner too, and it would be advisable he gets his sperm count evaluated. but you can still have conceived this cycle if you ovulated on the closed, and continued to have unprotected sex at least a week after your ovulation kit showed positive. your progesterone level pre-ovulation is not relevant at all. so- if you don't get a period by day 35 or so, do a pregnancy test. and if you didn't conceive this cycle, a reproductive endocrinologist might be a better choice to manage your closed. i hope this answered your question, and best of luck in getting pregnant. take care,"

"by four year old daughter have started to urinate very often . sometimes , she goes to the bathroom and in less than 20 minutes she has to go again . very night she wakes up to use the restroom more than once . sometimes we have to get out of the car and park in random places so that she can urinate . sometimes , she would say that she does to have the need to do it . while a couple of seconds before she cried because of the need to go to the bathroom . the does to take any medication and is a very healthy child . what can it be ? is this something a should worry about ?",1,33660,"hi there, the backed up stool and tendency to urinary tract infection does point to the idea that she could be constipated, despite being regular. regarding the frequency of bowel movements, do note that different people tend to have different bowel needs, up to 3 times a day is accepted as normal. so she could actually be going daily and still be relatively constipated. what we are aiming for is the right consistency of stools, which is long and sausage-like, with or without cracks. if you need more visual guidance, look for the bristol stool chart online, and aim for type 3 or 4. it is good that she is taking enough fibers, but also pay attention to her habits and stress to her that she needs to go when she feels like it even if it is more than once a day. constipation often occurs at this age because this is when they are getting better at holding it in, and prefer other exciting activities to sitting in the toilet. the other rarer possibility would be that she has a mild form of hirschsprungs disease, which means that some nerves are missing from the end of the colon, making the evacuating of stool difficult. most people have this diagnosed as babies, but if its very mild it can be missed. it might be more likely if she had delayed bowel movement more than a day after birth, or had tendency to constipation even as a baby. you will have to discuss with your doctor on this possibility, because confirmation would be needed with a rectal biopsy. hope this helps, and all the best to you."

"by of and i where messing around , i was wearing some shorts , and she was wearing leggings and underwear . be ruled up on eachother and she said she felt like i got in just a bit , like just in the lips , my shorts where a little wet and she told me she got wet herself , what is the likeliness that she is pregnant ? please let me know as soon as possible",1,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

what could this pain be ? my boyfriend has a constant stabbing pain on his right side between the button of his ribcage and his hip . he says it feels like gas but the pain is really bed . what might this be and should we think about going to emergency ?,1,47037,"hi there, if he is still having fevers and lethargic, i'd be worried that one of his grafts were infected. sometimes, it takes many weeks or even months to get over a major surgery, but he should start to improve and not decline. blood cultures would be the first place to start, as if he has blood cultures that show infection, i'd be very worried that his arterial grafts were infected. if he has negative blood cultures, that is more reassuring. if his incision is getting better, that's certainly a good sign. i would have a straight forward conversation with the surgeon who did the surgery and ask him why your husband hadn't fully recovered, and what his expectation for his recovery should be. if he's not eating well and having pain, then there are certain things that can be due such as a nasogastric feeding tube, or perhaps even iv nutrition. if he's having pain issues, then he should refer him to a chronic pain doctor. and finally, if he's having fevers, i'd ask the surgeon if he has an infection of the grafts, and if he says no, i'd ask him where he thought the fevers were coming from this far out of surgery. in this case, it sounds like you really have to push your surgeon for answers. no one will know the answers to these questions unless it's the surgeon who did the operation, who should be following him closely. i hope this is helpful. please contact me if you have any further questions."

"i have my a lower molar of both side and front lower teeth except canines missing since 1 year when i got them extracted due to severe caries . i showed to may nearby dentist for the replacement but either they suggested me for the fixed or implant treatment . but i done want any invasive procedure . when think of removable , its very cumbersome to adapt and adjust that initially . me confused , is there any other option available apart from this below i really need immediate replacement that too non invasive and non surgical . ply help",1,80352,"hello, if a gap is the size of a full tooth, your replacement considerations include a fixed bridge, a removable denture or implant. if your gap is less than a size of a tooth, you can consider a veneer with porcelain or bonding material. this would usually need to involve at least two adjacent teeth and would provide greater aesthetics if more teeth are involved. if possible, bonding would most likely be the least expensive option. orthodontic treatment would require braces to move teeth into improved placement. this would be the best choice especially if no restorations were needed after the movement and your bite would benefit by being stabilized. usually, the more teeth involved, the greater the expense when considering caps, crowns or veneers. more diagnostic information would be needed to evaluate if you could consider fewer teeth involved for your treatment. your bone support is a factor in this decision. implants are a good consideration for a single tooth replacement when the other teeth are in good condition. this requires multiple steps, is costly and requires a period of healing. something removable often offers a less expensive option for tooth replacement. there is a single cost per top and bottom, not per tooth. this is considered when you want to reduce costs, multiple teeth are missing, and you do not mind taking the appliance out of your mouth daily. i hope you find my suggestions helpful. i encourage you to discuss this with your dentist to determine your best option. consider a second opinion with all your records present to compare treatment suggestions and expenses. thank you for your inquiry"

(before the pills) i recommend :-wait for another week after the placebos are over. if no period, take a pregnancy test. if negative wait for another week and see your organ to check any hormonal imbalances or functional ovarian cysts (which are benign) that could be causing the delay in periods. some irregularities in menstrual cycle and flow is expected while starting the pill (about 3 months). this regulates over time. to answer your question specifically - no it is unlikely to get pregnant while on the placebos if you have been taking the pills regularly. the timing of the placebos coincides with the period after ovulation. hence, no fertilization can occur. hope this helps. please let me know if there is anything else i can help you with. wish you good health"

(as 25 mg is too low a dose and unlikely to provide any meaningful protection against seizures) the risk of seizures is highest in those with multiple lesions in the brain especially those with surrounding inflammation. even in people with calcified inactive lesions long term antiepileptic medications is necessary if the patient has recurrent seizures. in some it is possible to taper and stop medications after to 6 to 12 months of radiographic resolution of active infection. there should be no problem in continuing the antiepileptic medication when your sister gets pregnant. if she is apprehensive she can be switched to newer chat doctor. she could also discuss with her neurologist regarding a trial stopping of medication. hope this helps!"

"a am an 18 year old female and a just had a rapid onset of diarrhoea , accompanied by a passing of a large amount of bright oranges yellow liquid . also , there was burning during and after . a do not have a fever or abdominal pain or a history of digestion problems . a would like to know the likely cause of this issue . please and thank you .",1,34445,"hi, thanks for writing in. the collecting system of the kidney is made of renal calyxes and pelvis. this collects the urine formed in kidney and transports it through the ureter (tubes connecting kidneys and urinary bladder) to the urinary bladder. the pelvicalyceal system is the mouth of the kidney where it connects with the upper end of the ureter. i guess that you have got ultrasound scan done, and it shows mild fullness of the pelvicalyceal system in the left kidney, that is a term applied to increase in diameter of the collecting system in your left kidney. it is not a critical situation, and please do not worry if you do not have any urinary symptoms. since it is mentioned as mild fullness and no kidney stones have been found, therefore(i) it can be that your bladder was completely full at the of ultrasound scan(ii) your kidney pelvicalyceal system is appearing full by itself (extrarenal pelvis) and is an extension of normal appearance.(iii) rarely an infection of urinary system and kidneys (recent or old) can cause such a finding, but this is likely only if you have symptoms like pain in the region of kidney and problems like burning urination or discoloration of urine or any kidney infections in the past.(iv) stones in kidney or ureter can also cause fullness of pelvicalyceal system and since you do not have any stone therefore this does not apply to you. it is important to know if your scan was repeated after passing urine and still there was persistent mild fullness of the pelvicalyceal system on left side. this can also be confirmed by doing an mvp which is injecting a contrast and taking 5 to 6 x-rays to study the functioning of the kidneys in a better way. please consult the urologist."

"i , actually i want to know that a have 36 days mensuration cycle and in some books i read that those women have more than 35 days mensuration cycle they cant be ovulate is this true and my periods are always regular or if it is true so it will cause in pregnancy .",1,108096,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. it is true that theoretically you should have been clear of the injection within three months of discontinuation, however many women after being a depo-provera for a long time do not resume having ovulatory, regular, menstrual cycles until 6 to 9 months or even up to a year after discontinuation. unfortunately, it is difficult to artificially induce ovulation in women who are coming off depo-provera. if you were not trying to become pregnant, your cycle could be regulated temporarily with birth control pills, but if you're actually trying to get pregnant the best thing you can do with this point is to just keep trying and wait and see. if you feel any symptoms of pregnancy, and you haven't gotten your period for a while, i would do pregnancy test just to make sure. there is always a possibility even if your periods are not regular that you do ovulate sometimes. so in summary, continue having unprotected sex every other to every three days and give it some more time. 80% of couples will conceive within one year, and if after a year of trying you and your partner are unsuccessful, it might be a good idea to see a fertility specialist for an evaluation. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes, and good luck getting pregnant,"

"hello there.last week a stayed with my of for 6 days and we had a lot of sex during the time without protection . be never ejaculated inside me.after coming back to home , a was suspected about the dates and checked the calender , an a learned that the last day we spend together was my starting day of ovulation.a day later , ( at the last day of my ovulation ) a had a pinkish-lightpinkish discharge for around one day.now by the use of the ovulation calculator , a can say that yesterday was the last day of my ovulation period however today a started to have loads of white lumpy discharge . a started to get worried.do you think this is a sign of pregnancy ? it has been around 4 days since our last date ( that we had sex ) .waiting for a reply , asap . thank you.additional details an this be taken as a sign of pregnancy ? the discharge is lumpy thick sticky and white",1,72620,"hallow dear, the duration of pregnancy when counted from the last menstrual period is 280 days or 9 calendar months and 7 days. in fact the egg is released (ovulation) 14 days prior to the next expected menses; i.e. if the cycle is of 30 days the egg will be released on day 16 of the cycle. the egg has 24 hours life while the sperms are active for 72 hours. hence, the conception can happen about a week around the day of ovulation. considering this, for practical purpose we consider 2 weeks less from the day of ovulation (or conception). so the pregnancy precisely is of 266 days. however, for the sake of convenience, we calculate it as 280 days from the last menstrual period date. considering these facts, if the delivery date is to be expected on september 30, the last menstrual period date should be 23 december. (would you be having it then?) now your cycle is of 30 days period. so the expected date of ovulation should be 07 january. hence, if the conception takes place on 07 january, the due date of delivery would be 30 september. the hitch here is that you should have ovulation taking lace on 07 january. moreover, we have noticed that all the pregnancies do not last for 280 days. the delivery can take place any time between 3 weeks earlier to 1 week later than the expected due date of delivery. keeping these facts and calculations in mind, you may plan your sexual relations accordingly. i hope this will help you."

my husband is getting pain in the center of the heart i mean above the stomach exactly in center . is it any symptom of heart attack . what test should he undergo to find out why he is getting pain and also he gets stomach ache every now and then . that stomach ache is very severe,3,97433,"hi, after reviewing your question i assume you mean a positive breath test for h. pylori? i am sorry to hear the amount of discomfort that you've been through. this is how i would proceed to look at your case:1. your symptoms are very peculiar for peptic ulcer disease or gastritis. both are different ways of getting damage done to your stomach. an ulcer is like a crater which may or may not be prone to bleeding. gastritis is a bit like having multiple pinpoint sore spots, causing pain and discomfort. a positive breath test may mean that you have h. pylori infection. as uncomfortable as this is, it is usually very treatable. were you on many painkillers because of the spinal fusion? if yes, then they would certainly have contributed. 2. i don't think a mask has anything to do with this. a sterile nasogastric tube taken out of the bag is very unlikely to bring infection to the insides of the stomach. nasogastric tubes, however, do cause a bit of irritation in the stomach lining. while they could have a very small contribution, i doubt they have had a significant effect. 3. the problem at hand seems to be the h. pylori infection which is a bacterial infection of the stomach lining which causes wear and tear in the stomach. this bug is acquired by the orofacial route. what this means is that someone with h. pylori sheds the bacteria through their stools. sometimes, because of poor hand hygiene, they may pass it on to others, especially through food. the new victim ingests these bugs and in this way h. pylori finds a new home to infest. i don't think your husband having a breath test will add to anything if he does not have symptoms. 4. an unintentional weight loss may signify a gastric ulcer (in opposition to peptic ulcer)5. you may benefit from a look down into the stomach through gastrostomy. it will give a great deal of information. your weight loss is also an indication of getting you a ct scan of the abdomen to ensure that there is nothing dangerous in play. 6. treatment would include amoxicillin, azithromycin and an acid tablet such as omeprazole for a 10 to 14-day course. since these recommendations include a gastrostomy, you will eventually have to visit a physician or a gastroenterologist to have it done. gastroenterologists are also excellent at managing h. pylori infections, along with ulcers and gastritis."

"my mon who is 58 years old will be having a triple bypass , how long will her recovery be . she is not a smoker or a drinking but has high cholesterol issues and high blood pressure . does someone of this age have a better chance at no complications then someone older who drinks , smokes and has other health issues",1,38684,"hello, thank you for your query. i understand your concerns. for ideal blood glucose control the fasting blood glucose should be less than 110 mg/dl, the 2-hour post radial blood glucose should be less than 160-170 mg/do. i am not sure of your mothers age as these values are patients who are less than 55-60 years old and who are reasonably in good health. as a person becomes older or if there is a diabetic patient who has multiple problems, then these target values would also be a little higher than too tight control of an elderly persons blood glucose will cause them to have low blood glucose (hypoglycemia) and this can cause in serious complications. i am also not sure how often your mother is taking the glycimark m and the logo 0.2 mg. assuming your mother is less than 60 years old and that she is reasonably good health, if she is taking glycimark m 40/500 only once a day then it can be increased to twice a day (15 -30 min before breakfast and before dinner). if she is already taking this tablet twice a day, then she can increase the dose of this, she can take glycimark m 80/500 twice a day. recheck her blood glucose levels in 2 weeks. if her blood glucose is still high then she can take logo 0.2 mg either twice a day (if previously she has been taking it only once) or up to three times a day (if she has been taking it only twice a day). if at any point she experienced low blood glucose symptoms like sweating, hunger, dizziness, fast heart beat, mood changes etc., then it is the glycimark-m that is causing the symptoms, and she needs to reduce the dose of this. the immediate treatment of low blood glucose is by taking a tablespoon of honey/sugar, sugar candies, glass of fruit juice or regular pepsi/coke etc. this should be followed by a carboy chat doctor. her blood pressure is fine, and she needs to continue with her advance and cretan. i hope this answer has helped you. regards"

"a have a question in regards to my asthma 26 y/o . a was diagnosed with asthma about four years ago . a developed asthma right after a stored smoking . a have been with my current partner for about the same time , almost five years and he is a smoker . a have noticed that sometimes a get asthma episodes and/or attacks after a kiss him . now , he does not smoke around me , and a never kiss him after he smokes . that are the chances that my asthma worsens by kissing him ? that are the effects of his smoking in me ? pm very concerned because my asthma seems to worsen even if a take all my medication and follow up with every treatment.thank you .",1,10977,"hello, it's been 4 years that you have been diagnosed with asthma, for which you taking meds already, we need to consider few points first:as you know that asthma needs a trigger, which could be anything for example smoke, pollen, hay, animal fur, dust etc. when exposed to these it triggers a bronchospasm and an asthmatic attack occurs. so, as you said your partner smokes though not in front of you or around you, but he does smoke, that smoke is still present in his breath, his clothes and body and it's enough to trigger an attack anytime. i hope you both are aware about the ill effects of passive smoking, they are almost equivalent to active smoking. i would advise requesting your partner to think about quitting smoke because it's harmful for you and obviously for him in the long run. the medications that you take will also have a slower effect if smoking continues. i would also suggest you to book an appointment with your treating doctor and review your current medications maybe he/she might want to alter some to help you for a better control. i would also request you to keep a check of your peak flow which is basically the maximum air that you breathe out in one breath and accordingly modify your inhaler doses. you should also indulge in some physical activities like brisk walking or jogging which will help maintain a good lung capacity, ask your doctor about breathing exercises, they also help in maintaining a good lung function. prevention is always better than cure, so you both should meet your doctor and help your partner quit smoking which is beneficial for both. asthma can be a very debilitating illness and you both are young, so you can check it at an early stage and keep good health. if you have further queries you can get back to me, am always here to help. take care keep healthy."
