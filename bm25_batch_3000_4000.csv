"hello sir , almost 2 years has passed but my wife did not pregnant , a am normal and she has a little bit problem about periods , she was treated by the doctor and now her periods are in routine , but still she is not pregnant what should we do regarding this , the last date of her starting period is 18 january.and one more question which a want to ask how many time i should have to do intercourse ? thanks",1,40763,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the clearblue test is not very accurate in predicting gestational age. the amount of pregnancy hormone in a women urine can vary depending on the time of day she did the test and how much water she had to chat doctor. furthermore, many women have some bleeding in the first trimester of pregnancy, so the bleeding she had in december and january may not have been her real period at all. the most accurate way to test the age of a pregnancy, is an ultrasound exam to measure the fetus. this is normally done during the course of her routine prenatal care. an ultrasound is also necessary to determine if there is more than one fetus present. in your sisters case, if she conceived in november, the measurements of her uterus at this point would be accurate. so i would recommend that she have an ultrasound exam (which i am sure will be done soon as part of her routine prenatal care) to confirm her due date and the viability of the pregnancy. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes to your sister for her pregnancy,"

i my 6 month old started throwing her head back and forth for no reason . the does it when she is happy and she does it when she is upset but she always looks up then slams her head back down forward is this something i should be concerned about ? the also rubs her nose a lot pretty much constantly .,2,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"while they are doing laparoscopic gallbladder surgery , can they tell if there are stones in the ducts immediately or do they usually find out ahead of time ? does a sonogram show stones in the ducts ? of so can they remove them right then while in surgery , instead of waiting to see if they create problems later ?",1,76367,hi. can understand your concern. as per your complaint parotid gland is one of the major salivary gland and is present in front of the ear one on either side. any infection in the gland or obstruction in the ducts of the glands can lead to swelling in the gland. as per your symptoms the swelling increases while eating clearly indicates that there is obstruction in the ducts of the salivary gland leading to swelling. the obstruction occurs due to formation of crystalline stones within the ducts of the gland from minerals present in saliva leading to blockage of ducts and the formation of stones known as sialoliths can occur secondary to infection in the gland. when the duct is partially blocked and there is increased saliva flow during eating the saliva flows back to the gland and causes swelling. you should consult a dentist or an oral pathologist and get evaluated. in case of smallish you should take more of sour candies and lemon chat doctor. . in case if the stones are large a dentist can palpate the superficial stones along the duct course and push them out of duct. in case of stones in deeper locations of duct and large stones surgical removal is done. a technique known as microscopy which is an endoscopy technique can be done to locate the stones and subsequently removed. hope this information helps. if you find the answer helpful kindly write a positive review and click on found this answer helpful as a token of appreciation. thanks and regards.

hello my name is sandra hall a have been having blood test a have a infection that the doctor can not fine . my red cells have does not have a lot oxygen . a itches all over my body . white cell are going up platelets are going down .can you tell me what a should do ?,1,26797,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. low white blood cells (which are the disease-fighting cells in your body) can occur both as a result of a disease that lowers your white cell count (like hiv) or by consumption when your body is working hard to clear an infection. in your case, your doctors were concerned you had an infection in your body causing your white blood cells to fall. they found the infection in your kidneys and prescribed an antibiotic, which is it works, should clear the infection and your white cell count will return to normal. your white cell count and you're having a kidney infection does not affect the baby at all as long as you are treated properly and follow your doctors' advice. my only concern is that if you truly have a kidney infection, amoxicillin is not a particularly strong antibiotic for urinary tract infections. so if you have taken the medication for a few days, and you still have fever higher than 38.5 celsius, (101f) or bad flank pain occasionally iv antibiotics are needed for treatment. i hope my answer was helpful for you today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

(regular use of emergency pill is harmful)conception occurs if she was in 10th to 18th day of her cycle(in a regular cycle of 28 day duration). you can ask her at what day she is in and wait for next cycle to occur. if it delayed by 7 days then get done upt to diagnose if pregnant and then the required treatment can be taken. regards"

hi i am a gay man and have noticed that when ejaculate my semen is clear with a slight brown tinge to it .. this been happening now for the last couple of weeks .. a am now experiencing a pain in my scrotum .. i had an ultra sound a week ago and was found to be clear of anything .. i am also experiencing a slight burn sensation when i pee ..,1,80875,"thank you for asking chat doctor. my name is chat doctor. there is very rare chance that post-op laminectomy causes pain in knee. as this procedure is carried out by putting the patient on prone position and keeping appropriate sand bags below chest and thighs to free abdomen so that you might be experiencing these symptoms due to some physical mishandling during positioning. if the pain is not radiating to legs as before surgery it was, there is no much to worry about.just take good painkillers like naproxen sodium 250 mg tds for a week and gabapentin 150 mg bd. also keep doing exercises as advised by physiotherapist for this problem, i am sure you will be feeling comfortable with in a couple of weeks. hope this may help you. let me know if anything is not clear. thanks."

the left kidney was located in the left inferior flank region and has a dilated pelvis and proximal hydrometer measuring up to 9mm . the left kidney measures 37mm.the right kidney measures 35mm and is unremarkable .this is ultrasound report of 32.2 weeks and 2 days at last the comment is there is a left pelvic kidney with pelvicalyceal and uretreric dilation . i want to know is there is any thing serious ? what does it exactly mean ?,1,34445,"hi, thanks for writing in. the collecting system of the kidney is made of renal calyxes and pelvis. this collects the urine formed in kidney and transports it through the ureter (tubes connecting kidneys and urinary bladder) to the urinary bladder. the pelvicalyceal system is the mouth of the kidney where it connects with the upper end of the ureter. i guess that you have got ultrasound scan done, and it shows mild fullness of the pelvicalyceal system in the left kidney, that is a term applied to increase in diameter of the collecting system in your left kidney. it is not a critical situation, and please do not worry if you do not have any urinary symptoms. since it is mentioned as mild fullness and no kidney stones have been found, therefore(i) it can be that your bladder was completely full at the of ultrasound scan(ii) your kidney pelvicalyceal system is appearing full by itself (extrarenal pelvis) and is an extension of normal appearance.(iii) rarely an infection of urinary system and kidneys (recent or old) can cause such a finding, but this is likely only if you have symptoms like pain in the region of kidney and problems like burning urination or discoloration of urine or any kidney infections in the past.(iv) stones in kidney or ureter can also cause fullness of pelvicalyceal system and since you do not have any stone therefore this does not apply to you. it is important to know if your scan was repeated after passing urine and still there was persistent mild fullness of the pelvicalyceal system on left side. this can also be confirmed by doing an mvp which is injecting a contrast and taking 5 to 6 x-rays to study the functioning of the kidneys in a better way. please consult the urologist."

hi i have been diagnosed with pcos and have been trying for the past for years to get pregnant and have visited several genes who just do tests and give me medication to stop the bleeding and put me on birth control pills and i started taking folic acid today as i am desperate to fall pregnant ... please help,1,26444,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, i want to reassure you that if you have been taking your birth control pills as directed and you didn't miss any that the chances of your being pregnant are tiny. the failure rate of birth control pills in general is about 1 in 200 per year, meaning one out of 200 women has a chance of getting pregnant on the pill over the course of a year. many women can miss periods for reasons not due to pregnancy. your period can be affected by diet, traveling or changes in your schedule, and especially stress. even worrying about pregnancy can cause enough stress to delay your cycle. also, some women stop menstruating completely when they have been on the pill for a long time, especially low-dose pills like the microgynon you are taking. i suggest you purchase a urine pregnancy test (the over-the-counter ones are just as accurate as a doctor's office) and follow the package directions. if you are not pregnant, you can just wait and see what happens with your cycle and even if you never bleed just start your new pack on time, and you will be protected against pregnancy. if your irregular periods continue to bother you, you may want to see your gun provider who may be able to prescribe a different pill for you that may help you have predictable cycles. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"by daughter , aged 37 , and her husband , aged 41 , have been trying to get pregnant for over a year now with no success . by daughter thinks it is because she was on birth control for over fifteen years , but her husband recently had his sperm tested and was told that he has a high percentage of malformed sperm . also , he smokes , a think the problem is with the sperm . to you agree ?",1,43820,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, i want to reassure you that no matter what your endometrial measurement may be, 80% of couples will conceive within one year naturally. couples are not diagnosed as infertile until you have been trying and been unable to become pregnant for over one year. endometrial thickness is really only relevant in the context of couples trying to get pregnant through in vitro fertilization. the thickness of your uterine lining is somewhat related to your estrogen levels. when couples are undergoing ivf, treating with additional estrogen can thicken the uterine lining. however, because you've been only trying to get pregnant for four months, your endometrial lining may have absolutely nothing to do with the reason why you have not yet conceived. furthermore, unless your husbands' sperm count has been shown to be decreased, magazine should not have any effect on fertility nor should affect any health of a developing baby should you conceive. medications taken during pregnancy by the mother can affect the fetus, but not any medication taken by the father, because medication cannot be transmitted before fertilization through sperm. so unless the medication causes the sperm count to be low or abnormal, there is no medical reason why your husband needs to be off his medication for colitis in order for you and need to conceive successfully. i suggest that if he needs the medication for his health that he continue to take it. as for is maximizing your chance of healthy pregnancy, the best thing you can do is get plenty of sleep, eat a well-balanced diet, take prenatal vitamins, and tried to have regular(at least 2 to 3 days a week) unprotected intercourse from the time your menstrual period finishes until you begin to feel premenstrual symptoms. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and i wish you and your husband the best of luck in conceiving. best wishes,"

hello in taking kingtropin for the last 30 day and i notice that i have headaches and risk pain . is there a mayor side effect ? in 44 yrs old athletic and this is the first time in taking this or any other product . in injecting 2 units daily . what is the risk of taking it ?,1,53238,"hello, from what i could gather is that you were prescribed this medicine and without the doctors' knowledge you stopped it abruptly and most probably that was the reason you're throwing fits again. see you have to gauge risk to benefit of the medicine taking it for long time. if you are supposed to take it and that too in a particular dose, but you are not having it/taking lesser dose of same, in that case there are increased chances of having a fit. so it is always better to abide by what your neurologist has prescribed you and am sure that he will, in time taper off the dose as required. and as regards cure for this, if you take the medicine regularly there are fair chances you're getting rid of the ailment for good."

"i there , a have been on yaz birth control for around 7 years and have had very mild pms during my menstrual cycle but over the last few months , a be noticed a large amount of bloating/distended tummy before and after my short period . this month a got my period 2 days earlier so a finished 3 days earlier but a still have lower back pain and abdominal cramps just 3 days after my period stopped as if a a still on my period.is this normal to have pain 3 days after period ends ?",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

my top left canine tooth is bothering me if i rub finger across the front of the tooth its very sensitive and if i ruby the gum it sends a pain to the tooth and even when i put my makeup on with sponge i cant rub the area with out putting my tongue there on the gum to protect it and it also hurts to tap the tooth but it does not hurt to push up on the tooth or put my teeth together ? ? ? ? ? ?,1,57293,"hi. welcome to chat doctor. as per your complaint it seems that you have inflammation of the gum flap surrounding the wisdom tooth and the condition is known as peritonitis. pericoronitis occurs if food gets lodged between wisdom tooth and the gum flap covering the wisdom tooth... and by food it does not mean that you see big food particles stuffed in there, but it also means uncleaned area and bacterial growth below gum flap... it leads to inflammation of the flap leading to pain swelling and as the area lies close to the throat there can be sore throat and swollen lymph nodes. but pain in the tooth in front of the wisdom tooth can be infection or decay in second molar tooth. the line of treatment is antibiotics, painkillers, mouthwash but only this is not enough to you, you should go to dentist again and ask him to irrigate the area between gum flap and wisdom tooth with saline, betadine solution and hy chat doctor. . other thing is done warm saline gargles, it will help you to reduce inflammation... carry on with the course of your antibiotics and painkillers, your pain and swelling must go in two three days. once you get relieved of your discomfort visit the dentist again and get an iop ar (x-ray) done to find out whether wisdom tooth will erupt to proper occlusion or is impacted (means having an obstruction and won't erupt to occlusion). if it is not impacted just get your gum flap removed known as operculectomy and if impacted get your tooth extracted... this will be your ultimate treatment and finish your problem forever. if the second molar tooth is also decayed leading to pain you can get root canal treatment done to save the tooth and resolve infection. hope you recover soon. thanks and regards."

"a am currently taking the pill leven and a a having side effects like vomiting diorreah major bloating , red spotting and also head aches.is it my body adjusting ? because a don to have access to any other type of pill it the moment and it a my first time being on it . thanks",1,27194,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. tri-sprintec is a birth control pill that has a traffic regimen; which means that each color pill in the package has a slightly different dose of hormones. occasionally, women who take traffic pills may have some spotting in the first few days after each pill strength changes over the course of the month. this may cause some slight bleeding or spotting when were not supposed to have your period. whenever you had vaginal bleeding, regardless of the cause, usually there is some cramping that accompanies it. furthermore, it is not unusual to have irregular bleeding or spotting in the first 3 months of pill use. both sprinter and tri-sprintec are considered low-dose birth control pills, however there are many brands on the market that have a lower dose of estrogen than the pill you are currently taking. so you may have less irregular bleeding and spotting on a different kind of monophasic (same dose all month) birth control pill. regarding pregnancy, the chance of your conceiving while taking birth control pills and using a condom is basically nonexistent. so i believe the symptoms you were experiencing are side effects due to the new birth control pill. if your desire is for lighter, regular periods, a different brand of monophasic pill may work better for you with fewer side effects. i hope i was able to adequately answer questions today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"a am 30 years , trying to conceive for the past 6 months , a am advised to take glycomet of 500 , folic acid and from today being 16th may duphston.i have been given hucog today and under logical monitoring . wanted to check what are my chances of getting pregnant",1,19436,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. any woman having unprotected sex is at risk for pregnancy, so it certainly is possible that you may have conceived your first month. however, 80 percent of couples will conceive within one year, so if you divide that by 12 (for each month) you have about a 6 percent chance of conceiving per cycle. sperm live in the female genital tract for up to 72 hours, so it is generally recommended when trying to get pregnant to have sex every other day between the time your period finishes and the time you feel pms symptoms (which means you have already ovulated and can no longer conceive that cycle). so i would try to be patient and understand that it sometimes can take some time to become pregnant. in the meantime, i recommend you try to eat a healthy diet, get plenty of rest, avoid alcohol and smoking and begin to take folic acid, which is a b vitamin that has been shown to help prevent birth defects. 400 micrograms daily is the standard dose, which can be purchased alone or in prenatal vitamin preparations. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and i wish you the best of luck getting pregnant! best wishes,"

(as you said he has difficulty in walking now). you can also say to his parents that --- they can continue with all religious customs along with medicines, may be then they will agree... with medicine, he will start showing improvement in few days only... it is psychosis and patients will not agree to go to any doctor willingly, so you might need to take him forcefully. this is well accepted as it is for his benefit only. even if he doesn't agree for oral medicine there are injectables which are given to such patients... take the right step, take him to a doctor. hope the reply is useful feel free to ask more questions"

"i had sex with my boyfriend 15 days back , we used the condom but it slipped , and now i missed my date yesterday ... generally i done miss my dates on the contrary i get it 2 to 3 days earlier ... but now i a really very confused of being pregnant please suggest me what should i do ? or how will my date start ..... ?",1,102381,"hi, dont worry. the best way to know how far long in pregnancy you are would be to do an ultrasound. an ultrasound done in the first three months of pregnancy is more reliable to date the pregnancy than even the dates of missed period. we now consider the date as calculated from the first ultrasound more accurate. so it is very much advisable if you went for a scan as soon as possible. also take folic acid if not taking already. better to get checked, especially since you have had a history of miscarriage. hope this helps. regards."

"hello doc , i have a 2-year old niece and she was diagnosed with of ... could you kindly explain to me how serious this disease for child like her age ... and other than medication , what will be the proper treatment for her for her fast recovery ... thanks and god bless",1,110490,"hi, i understand your concerns about the health of your mother and i will try to explain at you the risks for such surgery at a patient at 85 years old. first that you must understand is that the main problem here is not the procedure itself. an expert surgeon might do a laparoscopic cholecystectomy without any problem and this procedure lasts around 30 to 40 minutes. the main risks are correlated with her age, her heart disease, kidney and liver function and if she has other chronic problems or not. for example if your mother has only hbp, it is not a problem to do the surgery. but if she has cardiopulmonary compromise than she has high risks for cardiac complications. it would be great if i had the medical reports of your mother, and medical history to know her risks/complications. if all her organs are working fine, especially her heart, liver and kidneys than she might do the surgery and probably without any serious complications during or after the surgery. her surgeon and her anesthesiologist will be able to give you more information than me for her risks and complications because they know her medical history, and function of her other organs. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

a have a lump about the size of a dime and its oval shaped . its right between my vagina and my inner thigh . there is no head on it and it in to hard . it does to hurt unless a mess with it and its red . a don to know what to do because a don to have insurance to go to the doctor . now do a get rid of it ? that could it be ?,1,33931,"hi michele jacobi the first thing that has to be done once you find a lump in the region of the chest wall is to confirm what it is. in your case a biopsy has already been done and let us await its result. you're understanding that cancerous lumps don't bleed after biopsy is correct. but i think your presumption that if it was scar tissue it would have bled is not correct. scar tissue also need not bleed. needle biopsies do not usually cause any bleeding unless a blood vessel is ruptured during the procedure since how long have you noticed this lump. is the size of the lump increasing ? if the biopsy comes as positive for cancer then you will have to undergo a series of investigation to find out he the extent of the disease. ? whether it is confined to the chest wall only or whether it has gone beyond the chest wall to other regions. treatment decision will depend on the results of this if the biopsy comes as negative for cancer then there are 2 options 1- if your physician thinks it is insignificant then you need to follow it up. just keep a check on your lump to see whether it is increasing in size and also get it checked by your physician regularly2- the second option (and my preference) is to do an open biopsy especially if the lump was detected recently and is increasing in size and also if the lump is firm to hard (and not very soft). the reason is needle biopsy can be negative, but this does not always mean there is no cancer especially if the tissue sample taken is not adequate. also time factor is important. you may lose time keeping the lump under follow up to see whether it is increasing in size hope you are satisfied with my reply. anyway don't worry. follow your doctors' advice chat doctor."

a have cirrhosis of the liver . three days ago my stool was accompanied by lots of blood which was very red and clear . yesterday this bleeding stopped but now it has been bleeding again today . a have bowel movements at least 3 times a day sometimes more so it makes for quite a bit of blood lost . a am thinking this bleed is coming from burst hemoroids and small veins in that area but i am still concerned with the loss of blood as my cirrhosis is a level 4 .,1,38727,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. one of the ways that you can possibly figure out where the bleeding is coming from is by putting a tampon inside. if, while wearing the tampon, you still see blood on your underwear then the bleeding is coming from your rectum. in that case, there is less to worry about as it is most likely from your hemorrhoids. to reduce the chances of your hemorrhoids causing bleeding, eat lots of fruits and vegetables and chat doctor. this will not harm the baby, but will rather make your stool softer said it is easier for you to have a bowel movement. if the tampon has blood on it than the bleeding definitely is coming from vagina. a small amount of bleeding can happen during late pregnancy as your cervix starts to soften to eventually prepare for labor. however, this type of blood should be dark brown or purple and mixed with mucus. if you are having bright red blood coming from your vagina, i would call your doctor for advice. if you have any risk factors for bleeding during pregnancy; such as being on blood thinners, having a low-lying or placenta prefix, or experiencing any other symptoms like uterine contractions it might be prudent for you to go to an emergency room for evaluation. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

"hello , last year october i had about 4 weeks of heavy bleeding . took an ultrasound and it was discovered that i had cyst on my ovaries . my periods were always irregular but the longest id go without a period was two to three months . since getting the bleeding to stop last october i beefed up on vitamins- folic acid and a complex especially and also was taking a heavy dose of herbal medications . what concerns me now is that i haven seen my period since , yes live had unprotected sex since that october in fact that november . now its a whole lot of months later and i want to know what are my chance of being pregnant . i did one of thoshad a a pregnancy calculator things and when asked to fill in my last period i did which was oct 26 2012 and it told me the day i might have conceived which was the exact date i had intercourse . in now experiencing nassau , indigestion , mood swings , weight gain , lot of sleeping and always tired , breast tenderness at times , what confuses me is that when i researched pcos i read that it mimic pregnancy symptoms and i took a hot which had a negative result but i know my body live never missed a period for this long would i be pregnant ?",1,49266,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. if you last had your period on september 12th, and today is october 5th, your period is not yet late for october. most women have a 25-35 day cycle, so until you actually miss your period for october, there is no reason to assume you are pregnant. the folic acid and zinc you are taking are just extra vitamins that provide health to a growing pregnancy; these should not affect or change your menstrual cycle or its symptoms. if your period is late in october, you should purchase and perform an over-the-counter pregnancy test. modern pregnancy tests are very accurate and can be positive even 10 days after conception. if you do find out you are pregnant, there is nothing that needs to be done immediately as pregnancy is not a disease- it is a normal state for women in the reproductive phase of their lives. so it is important only to keep taking your vitamins, get plenty of rest, eat a balanced diet and avoid alcohol, caffeine and chat doctor. if your period is mate, but you are not pregnant, the delay in your cycle can have a number of causes, including hormonal imbalances, certain medical conditions like thyroid disease, and even the stress of worrying about pregnancy. if you miss more than 2 months of your cycle (no bleeding for 3 months) and your pregnancy test is negative, you should see a physician for a hormonal evaluation. so in summary, a late menstrual cycle can be caused by pregnancy, but there are other causes as well. i suggest you perform a pregnancy test if you are late, and if it is negative, try to be patient, and you will likely get it before another month goes by. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"a had sex the other night , we used a condom , and a have been on birth control for a year taking it every morning without missing any . the condom broke and we noticed and immediately stopped . be had not came , but there was most likely precut in it . be peed before we started , and a be read that most washes out any sperm that remains in the urethra . would a be pregnant ? or am a just worrying for no reason",1,22940,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, the depo-provera injection becomes immediately effective against pregnancy the day you get the shot. the reason why it is recommended for you to start taking demo while you have your period is to make sure that you have not already become pregnant and get the injection while pregnant. so if you had a shot two weeks ago, even if you had a condom accident, and especially since you took morning-after pill, there is no reason to suspect that you are risk for pregnancy. however, a urinary tract infection, which is inflammation of the bladder, can occur after sex if chafing during sex especially externally rubs bacteria into the urethra (the urinary opening). this is common in women who use condoms as the ring on the condom can irritate this area during penetration. so i think you can be reassured that your symptoms are not due to pregnancy. however, i think you most likely do have a uti and should visit your local physician or clinic for evaluation, so you can get a prescription for antibiotics to treat it. if you are now going to be having unprotected sex with your current partner, you both should be tested for stds to make sure that you are not at risk of giving anything to one another. however, this point there is no evidence that your symptoms could be caused by an std. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

a have a low see rate now after 8 weeks of antibiotics to treat staph cures that was in the t9-t10 area . the mri shows that there is still something going on there but no one can tell me if its infection or inflammation . now can a find out before doing an operation ?,1,22523,"hi, thanks for writing in. there is a bit of confusion in your statement. it is not clear if the path reports consistently said it was a liposarcoma. mri is a good investigation tool for tumors and shows the size, location, infiltration and any associated structural involvement. the path reports are confirmatory and always have to be matched with the mri results. if path reports say it was malignant then there is no other way to tell that it isn't one. in view of what is written above and considering that the path reports were altered subsequently, the appearance of a new tumor in the area requires ct or mri scan and an image guided biopsy from the active region of the tumor. this is essential to know if there is a locally aggressive process going on and if it should be treated. the pain can be due to nerve entrapment by the tumor and that must also be looked in to. a biopsy is the final confirmation in your case. there is no need to get scared as it can also be a focus of chronic infection in the operated area. please do not worry."

"hello , a have a question . a started taking orth try cycle to birth control about four months ago a believe . a did to have a period the whole month of january which is understandable because they said it would be normal to miss one the first 1-3 months . by period then came right on the first of february . it then ended but for some reason around the 27th or 28th of that month a was spotting and it lasted for a while . a was very confused . a took two pregnancy tests and they both said negative . a went to the clinic and they changed my birth control . a haven to had my period this month yet . should a be worried or okay since both tests were a negative ?",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

( a do not have any caffeine or a low blood sugar )",1,53315,"good afternoon. i can certainly tell that you are not the nervous type if you are willing to write your question out and submit it the way you have. that takes a bit of courage. there are a couple of things to come to my mind when you describe your situation. one is called orthostatic hypotension or also orthostatic tremors. this condition is one where a person can start shaking in their hands and their knees and their arms and their legs after they have been up on their feet for a few seconds or a few minutes. usually, when this starts to happen, and they sit down the shaking goes away. the other thing is called benign essential tremor or benign essential familial tremor if the condition runs in one of your family members. however, in this case i would go preferentially with the first one since it seems as if your trimmers get worse when you are standing and writing something.at any rate, you should see a doctor who can take your blood pressure is in different positions such as lying, sitting, and standing and make a determination whether not you may have such an entity. would you please rate this answer with a star rating if it meets your approval for what you were looking for. and good luck to you in school."

( a do not have any caffeine or a low blood sugar )",2,92350,"hi and welcome to chat doctor ... thanks for your question. from your question i gather that you become excessively nervous and have trembling of your hands, especially during social situations. so, in other words, you seem to be having an ""anxiety"" problem... generally, anxiety can manifest itself in two ways: 1) psychological... i.e. feeling nervous, tensed, unable to relax, etc. and 2) somatic... i.e. bodily symptoms like trembling of hands, rapid beating of the heart, sweating, etc. now, it is important to know whether your anxiety is confined only to social situations or whether you keep experiencing some anxiety most of the time and are unable to relax completely. if your anxiety is only confined to social situations and if you are feeling well and relaxed during other times, then you most likely are having ""social anxiety"". having some amount of anxiety is normal, but it becomes abnormal if... it is either excessive or if it affects your normal functioning... so, if you feel that your anxiety is present too often or too much or is interfering with your functioning or performance, then you may be having an anxiety disorder, and you need help. therapy for anxiety disorders is usually of two types: 1) medication and 2) psychological therapies like behavior therapies, talking therapies, etc. this choice would be based on the severity of your symptoms, the availability of a good therapist and of course, your personal choice as well. often, relaxation techniques such as breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, yoga, etc. can help a lot in reducing anxiety symptoms. you also mentioned that you have mild trembling even when you are not nervous. some people can have a mild basal tremor which is called an ""essential tremor"", which is generally harmless and does not need any intervention unless it is disabling. i would suggest that you consult a psychiatrist locally, so that he / she would be able to assess you in detail to find out what type and how severe your anxiety is and whether you need any medication or any other therapy for the same. please feel free to clarify any doubts that you have... wish you all the best."

since the 20th of this month i started experiencing keep founding palpitations i finished my menses 3 days ago they are random at times i feel mild ache in my shoulders sometimes the left also seems aggravated by eating heavy meal exercised regularly ... did have major stressor at work but those passed will be evaluated by cardiologist though primary doc thinks it anxiety asian seems to help with palpitations but does it sound like a blockage issue ? more a holder monitor but done know results also a little anaemic hgb 9 thanks,1,25691,"dear, there is a wide variety of causes of palpitations right from benign to some rare life-threatening causes. first you need to give little more details of your palpitations, like if they start and stop suddenly, any associated giddiness or loss of consciousness. regarding tachycardia that was detected on holder monitoring, please specify the kind of tachycardia. also, the holder will detect the cause of your palpitations only if you get palpitations while the holder is attached to you. but going through the details of your case, it seems you have nonspecific palpitations which may be anxiety related. so just relax and send the details required for the more detailed evaluation."

"a had a stent placed in my heart in march . a couple of days later a had very sharp pain go down my left leg to the top of my toes and have had an uncomfortable sensation in the area above my left toes ever since . last week a don to recall hitting anything , but a felt a knot rising on my front left thigh . a immediately went to check it out and discovered a large bruise in the area with a lump in the middle . a put ice on it and it seemed to go down , but last night a again noticed the lump . the area in the middle of the bruise where the lump is is now almost back to flesh color . a take slavic and aspirin daily . is this lump cause for concern ? a am 59 years old , 5 4 and weigh 139 lbs .",1,82366,"hello friend, thank you for posting your query through chat doctor. i am a homeopath answering your query and the answer which i am going to give you may contain several thoughts which may appear strange or new for you. this i say because homeopathy is a new system of medicine and is almost unheard by the majority of the population. therefore, due to the high influence of the conventional medicine the people at large are brainwashed to believe and act according to the health education given by them. coming back to the fibroadenoma of your left breast in the year 1979, you had a psychological conflict in the mind level. you are a sensitive individual and that is why your left breast was affected. it must have been related with your child chat doctor. the sensitivity is genetic, and you reacted to the conflict through the brain according to a genetic programming. mind-brain - organ affection resulted in the development of a lump in your left breast in 1979. you consulted your gynecologist, and he suggested that it may turn to become cancerous in future and so it is better to remove it, and you subdued to his suggestion. actually the lump in the breast was an attempt of the body to cure you, or it was the result of a self defense mechanism. since you had not resolved the conflict in the psychological level, the lump remained there without getting resolved. but the body kept the lump protected in a cyst with minimum amount of inflammation called chronic cystitis. by removing the fibroadenoma or chronic cystic mastitis, you were not cured, but your lump in the breast was removed. in 1995 also you are the same person, you are the same sensitive person, and you underwent another more serious psychological conflict and the same left breast was again affected in a more serious manner. instead of recognizing the mass as a defense mechanism, you got the fear in you that you have cancer. the tissue changes also suggested that there is more serious pathology, and they labelled your lump this time as cancer and suggested removal of your left breast. if you could have recognized the lump as a defense mechanism and if you had no fear of cancer, you could have retained your breast. but the fear of cancer is such that it is associated with death and so you lost your breast. in no case, either by removal of lump in 1979 or by removal of your breast in 1995, you are not cured only your disease is cured. hope by this time you have got the answer for your query. both are related to each other because they are in the same individual, same sensitivity, same program. homeopathy cures the person and once the individual is cured all his diseases will be cured. with best wishes,"

"yesterday when a woke up a noticed very , soft little bumps very close together and a lot of them , on the roof of my mouth , today they have spread to the inside of my cheek and lower lip . do you know what this could be ? when a rub them with my tongue , it almost feels like powder . pretty weird .. all going to the doc this week but just ant to know if its serious . thanks",1,89135,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the bumps you likely are feeling on your cervix are most likely nathan cysts rather than polyps. polyps are fleshy soft growths that are just out pouching of the normal glands that line the canal of the cervix. it would be difficult to feel them, and they usually cause irregular bleeding or bleeding after sex. they do not cause infertility (uterine polyps can, but those are not the same and are not possible to feel because they are inside your uterus. nabothian cysts are just blocked mucus glands that can feel like knobby bumps on the cervix. they also are not harmful and do not interfere with fertility. both of these findings on your cervix can be seen on a spectrum exam, so a gun doctor would be able to tell you what you are feeling if they looked inside you. also, regarding the position of your cervix, this also has no bearing on fertility and does not change from month to month, so you do not need to check your cervix regularly especially if you have a yearly gynecologic checkup. regarding bbt charting for conception, your temperature goes up after you ovulate, so i recommend not checking it anymore if you know around when you ovulate in your cycle and just have sex every other day from the time your period finishes until you feel premenstrual symptoms. some women only have sex after their temperature goes up, and they miss the actual time of ovulation. so there is no reason to suspect you will have problems conceiving, and you do not need to be treated for this because it is a normal finding in many women. 80 percent of couples will conceive within a year. if you have been having sex at the right time and it's almost a year, it might be wise to have a gun exam and a hormonal evaluation, and also have your fiancé get his sperm count checked, as 50 percent of the time it can be a male factor. i hope i was able to answer your question and that my advice was helpful. best wishes and good luck with your pregnancy plans,"

"hi i have been diagnosed with pc at the age off 14 . by partner and i have spoken about trying for a family and we have been for a year in currently on a strick diet to help lose some weight and it is coming off slowly my thyroid medication has been increased as last blood test showed they were below average again quite a lot , is there any things else i can do and or take to help my chances to conceive .",1,10535,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. pregnacare conception is simply a combination of vitamins that help a woman have a healthy pregnancy from conception. it has no hormonal effects and should not have any impact on the regularity of your cycle nor your ability to conceive, it is not unusual for women to bleed on and off for even 6 weeks after a miscarriage so the 19-day bleeding episode you had may not have actually been a menstrual period but still could have been bleeding leftover for your d and c. so you may not be ""late"" at all, but may just have not had a real period since the pregnancy. there is no reason to assume you would have problems getting pregnant again since you have conceived naturally twice in the last year. either way, the pregnancies conception vitamins have nothing to do with your irregular bleeding. it is generally advisable to wait to try to conceive again after your first real period-so i would wait until you bleed again to resume trying to conceive. if you do not get a real period by 3 months from your last bleeding episode, you should follow up for your gun for a re-evaluation of your hormones and treatment with progesterone, which can restart your period cycling. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful. best wishes,"

pm in the military and a injured my back 3 months ago and a have been to the doctor 3 times and the first time the said a had a fracture and then the next time they said a hurt it before a came in the military and now there saying a was born with it and during all this a have been doing physical therapy but it is not improving and tonight a can early stand up . that should a do ?,1,65548,"hello, as you had a fall over the knee and there is a cut of the skinny area also, i don't think it will be a fracture, because if it was then there would have been no fracture because the knee cap bone is too strong to with stand such falls. but it's always good on a safer side to take up an x-ray. if x-ray reveals fracture than the limb will be made immobilized using knee brace in hairline fracture but if it's a displaced fracture then treated accordingly. most of the time it is a bony hurt and needs only a knee cap and hot water fermentation. post a few days only exercise to strengthen the weaker muscle groups. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further. take care jay in chat doctor."

(only if it is an electronic machine). thank you"

"hello , a have had the implants inserted for about 2 years now , a had a lot of spotting and so a couple of months ago a took birth control pills and that made the spotting stop . a couple of days ago a smoked marijuana and suddenly my spotting returned , could the marijuana have caused the spotting ?",1,27194,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. tri-sprintec is a birth control pill that has a traffic regimen; which means that each color pill in the package has a slightly different dose of hormones. occasionally, women who take traffic pills may have some spotting in the first few days after each pill strength changes over the course of the month. this may cause some slight bleeding or spotting when were not supposed to have your period. whenever you had vaginal bleeding, regardless of the cause, usually there is some cramping that accompanies it. furthermore, it is not unusual to have irregular bleeding or spotting in the first 3 months of pill use. both sprinter and tri-sprintec are considered low-dose birth control pills, however there are many brands on the market that have a lower dose of estrogen than the pill you are currently taking. so you may have less irregular bleeding and spotting on a different kind of monophasic (same dose all month) birth control pill. regarding pregnancy, the chance of your conceiving while taking birth control pills and using a condom is basically nonexistent. so i believe the symptoms you were experiencing are side effects due to the new birth control pill. if your desire is for lighter, regular periods, a different brand of monophasic pill may work better for you with fewer side effects. i hope i was able to adequately answer questions today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"i , i been on birth control for a month , and i had unprotected sex with my of , should i take the morning after pill ? could the mix of both pills do harm ? or i shouldn't worry ? i been taking the of everyday , but not always at the same time , does this affect in any way ?",2,27194,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. tri-sprintec is a birth control pill that has a traffic regimen; which means that each color pill in the package has a slightly different dose of hormones. occasionally, women who take traffic pills may have some spotting in the first few days after each pill strength changes over the course of the month. this may cause some slight bleeding or spotting when were not supposed to have your period. whenever you had vaginal bleeding, regardless of the cause, usually there is some cramping that accompanies it. furthermore, it is not unusual to have irregular bleeding or spotting in the first 3 months of pill use. both sprinter and tri-sprintec are considered low-dose birth control pills, however there are many brands on the market that have a lower dose of estrogen than the pill you are currently taking. so you may have less irregular bleeding and spotting on a different kind of monophasic (same dose all month) birth control pill. regarding pregnancy, the chance of your conceiving while taking birth control pills and using a condom is basically nonexistent. so i believe the symptoms you were experiencing are side effects due to the new birth control pill. if your desire is for lighter, regular periods, a different brand of monophasic pill may work better for you with fewer side effects. i hope i was able to adequately answer questions today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"
"i , i been on birth control for a month , and i had unprotected sex with my of , should i take the morning after pill ? could the mix of both pills do harm ? or i shouldn't worry ? i been taking the of everyday , but not always at the same time , does this affect in any way ?",3,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"well sometimes ill be sitting , standing or walking and out of nowhere it feels like my heart just suddenly hesitates to beat ... so it will hesitate then beat what could this be ?",2,25338,"hello and thank you for using chat doctor. i carefully read your question and understand your concern. but you should not worry, its nothing serious. as you describe, my opinion is that it might be a rhythm issue. someone can feel strong and fast heart beats for different reasons. it may be a simple sinus tachycardia. this means that the heart is beating faster than 100 beats for minute. its normal range in a resting condition is between 60-100 beats for minute. when it goes up you may feel a strong heart beat in your chest and a sensation like your body is beating too. another reason for this sensation might be what we call an ekstrasystol.these is electrical heart impulses that generates in some parts of heart different from normal sinus rhythm. this generates an escaped beat that the person feels like jumping ore bumping. it gives the sensation like a beat is skipping, may experience palpitations or an anxiety sensation that your daughter explains like trembling. this extrasistoles may happen from different reasons from simple emotional stress to other pathologies like anemia, hyperthyroidism etc. so, my opinion as cardiologist is that you have nothing to worry. it is just a simple episode, and it is quite normal in younger ages. only if these symptoms persist and begins to interfere the daily live, if i was your treating doctor i will recommend some examinations like a blood analysis to exclude anemia, the thyroid hormones, an electrocardiogram, echocardiography and of course a holder monitoring. this will help us to document and see what happens with heart rhythm. at meantime, i will recommend your daughter to avoid coffee, caffeine products because they rise heart frequency and extrasistolic beats. i encourage her to have physical training because sometimes it helps in reducing extrasistoles, tachycardia, even making them disappear. wish i was helpful. take good care. best regards"

a have had extreme pain in both hips for several months now . the onset of this pain was sort of sudden . now a am having some pains shooting in my shoulder joints and in my knees . i can tell that this is progressing rather quickly . by doctor is treating me for bursitis . a was on naproxin for a couple of weeks . it helped a little . a had to stop taking it due to side effects . the pain was back immediately . by question is `` to you think that a might need to seek out a specialist ?

"hi this is wendy here , age 32 , female , height 1.62m , weight 56kg . in an asthmatic since i was a child . 2 days ago , i feel my left side chest pain and bit swell . today , i start to feel pain when i breathe and i have shortness of breath .. plus advise me about my condition thanks",1,15046,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. feeling short of breath is not unusual while you're pregnant because the hormones of pregnancy actually have a way of telling your brain to breathe faster. this is to ensure that your baby gets enough oxygen, because as your belly gets bigger your lungs are not able to expand as well. so many women feel the sensation of needing to catch their breath all the time when they breathe when they are in the third trimester. in addition, because you would have been on bed rest for so long, you probably are not in very good cardiovascular shape. another possible reason why you could be feeling short of breath is that there is a possibility that you are anemic. normally, as part of routine prenatal care we check your blood count as well is a test for gestational diabetes somewhere between 24 and 28 weeks. if you've not yet had this test, it might be a good idea to mention your symptoms to your doctor. of course, there can be some serious, dangerous things that can cause shortness of breath; like blood clots that spread to your lung, or fluid in the lungs and other pulmonary problems. if you experience any chest pain or severe shortness of breath or start developing a productive cough, you should notify your doctor immediately and possibly go to the hospital for evaluation. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

""b"" these devices are great for grinding. i prefer hard night guards because the firmness helps prevent them from breaking down and they don't flex like soft night guards which in your sleep may be perceived as food and induce more grinding. i personally use a night guard and found that it has improved my bruise condition greatly. they are well worth the money. best regards and good health"

"good evening , a am the parent of a 14 year old girl . the started experiencing upper abdominal pain on march 28th . the complained with the pain constantly and them would be worse after eating . be have had upper of , stomach tempting scan , ultrasound , and rays , all with no signs of something abnormal . the has been on prescription prilosec and erthymocin for the 2 months with no relief . of she does not take the erthymocin at least 30 minutes before she eats , the pain is worse . her of has pretty much given up and says there is nothing medically wrong with her and they want to explore anxiety . but a know as a parent that , that is not he problem . an you please let me know what your thoughts are ? thanks",1,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

""compulsions"" are repetitive, unwanted acts or rituals or behavior which the person is aware of doing but is unable to control, thus resulting in distress. compulsions can exist alone or may often be associated with underlying ""obsessions"" (which are repetitive, unwanted thoughts, ideas or mental images) as part of a disorder called obsessive compulsive disorder (ocd). you need to elaborate more on his other behavior, for example, the humming and talking to himself. such symptoms, in childhood, can be due to a variety of causes (they could even be some kind of obsessive / compulsive symptoms, especially because your son is well aware of them and is distressed by them). what i would strongly advise you to do is to get a consultation with a child psychiatrist, who would be able to assess your son in detail and advise the appropriate management plan. please do not hesitate or delay as it would only be putting your son through more unnecessary suffering and distress. all the best. -"

"yes , a have had pain in my shoulder for a number of years and am unable to reach my right hand too far up and not at all behind my back . now my left shoulder has become painful and a can not reach too far up but a am still able to reach behind my back although it is painful . a would like to try exercises but do not want to damage my shoulders more .",1,8785,"if it is taken for time being then it is key, but should not be taken as treatment for shoulder pain. shoulder pain has to be diagnosed properly and should be treated accordingly. i am sure the physiotherapy treatment what she is taking will be according to her diagnosis and will help her to get relief. you can also ask her to use hot and cold pack frequently to get some more soft tissue healing with relaxing soft tissue, increasing blood circulation, and reducing inflammation. here just wanted to update you to check whether she has frozen shoulder or it's a soft issue damage (rotator cuff).because many times it is diagnosed wrong and treatment for both is different. for frozen shoulder more over as a physio i do treatment with shoulder manipulation. and for soft tissue injury the manipulation is not suggested and only the soft tissue relaxing and healing treatment only can be given. to check if your mother able to move her hand up standing against wall as well take hand on her back with little pain then it is related to soft tissue pain. and if she is not able to move hand up complete with range block feeling then it can be frozen shoulder. if still confuse then still can be diagnosed properly with mri. here my only advise is treat the cause of the pain and painkiller should be for time being. hit the thanks if it is useful. take care."

"i a have this little lump in my earlobe , it only hurts if squeezed and done know what it is , a had an odd cut there and that like liquid type pus would come out of it so a am thinking it may be broken cartilage , and that ball is kind of the same thing as cauliflower ear , that is just my guess ..",1,74210,"hello! thank you for the query. yes, umbilical hernia can always be a reason of abdominal pain. however, it can be also asymptomatic. hernia is simply a hole in the abdominal wall. when the hole is small, but big enough to let intestine or momentum to get through, the contents of hernia gets squeezed and that is what hurts. so if in your belly button is a lump which hurts when you pres it, that can be the cause of your symptoms. if hernia is empty, it should not hurt at all. if it is about ascites, in most cases it does not hurt at all. the only way it can hurt, is when there is so much liquid inside your abdomen, that intestines gets squeezed, and it can lead to intestine blockage. but it would be easily visible, and your abdomen would become unnaturally big, like with big ball inside. hope this will answer your questions. regards"

hello for the past three days i have a pain in front of by chest near my right arm pit and chest it hurts when i cough and when i use my right hand even when i try to clear my through its little better now what might of caused this there is no redness or bruising i went to a doctor he said to see a chiropractor or it might be a cold what could it be,2,21962,"dear simone, there is one rule for doctors here in croatia: when you think too much, stop, and think again, but this time think for the simplest diagnose. if you have pain in abdomen and an umbilical hernia seen on us then the first thing to think about is ""abdominal pain caused by hernia"":). there are many conditions in medicine where pain doesn't need to beau localized near the ""pathology"". sometimes pain can be felt on the opposite side of the affected organ. it is known that one of common symptom of myocardial infarction is pain in the left shoulder. also, infection of the abdominal organs can give many types and localizations of pain. the reason for it is simple: when i see pain, i see nerves, not organs (this is my own phrase:)). nerves conduct pain, and nerves are all around, going from periphery to the brain, so pain can be localized on its pathway, so just let's go back to your problem. doctor should tell you the size of hernia and its content which can be only preperitoneal tissue, momentum or even intestines. this dark triangle...mmm.it can be nothing and everything. i usually don't trust our ultrasonographer because they are strange people... sometimes they don't see what they need to see, or they see what they don't need to see. all i see is that us is operator-dependent diagnostic test... but we shouldn't underestimate this finding. it can be uterine moma, endometriosis, cyst or tumor. and yes, it can cause pain you're describing. so what you need to do: 1. ct scan of pelvic and abdominal region. why? as i said, these us findings are always doubtful, ct is a high sensitive test which will find the exact problem for sure. it will tell you the size and severity of hernia and the morphology of this uterine lesion. it can also find some other problems in its early phase."

"i , a was on bette birth control pills but stopped taking it for a month . a started taking bette again about a week ago but not during the start of my period . of a have unprotected sex , will a get pregnant ? or how long do a have to wait before a can have unprotected sex ?",3,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

a stopped my birth control a month ago last day of my period was last month on the 14 it is now the 13.i have dahlia as well as a little brown discharge could this be from stopping my birth control or pregnant ? a took 3 home pregnancy test and all were negative . a also have had a pin drop size of blood but that was all,2,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

a took almost two weeks ago the morning after pill because the condom broke.yesterday a did just one test because a was feeling cautious and had stomach . it was positive . would a be pregnant or could it be a false positive ? should a try another test ?,1,1599,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the morning after pill is 90 percent effective if taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse. so, regardless of what happened with your pill taking before your pill-free week, the morning-after pill should still be effective. many women have a delayed period after taking the morning-after pill as a side effect, but the possibility of pregnancy still exists if you are late, so you should perform a urine pregnancy test just in case. if it has not been 2 weeks yet since your unprotected encounter, it may be too early to have a positive pregnancy test, so i would repeat it in a week if that is the case. in addition, many women have an irregular period or skip entirely after they stop the pill. if you are not pregnant, you can start a new pack of pills as soon as you get them, but just use a condom as a backup for the first two weeks. you should get a period in the pill-free week as you did previously. i hope i was able to answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"
