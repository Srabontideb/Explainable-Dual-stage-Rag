"hello a am trying to conceive from last 1 year but unsuccessful can you guide me with problems that can cause me getting conceive , myself had blood test its normal , my husband sperm tests are normal , what is the intake of food i can take , and a know best ovulation date is between 10 -14 days after my periods.please can you guide me in brief .",1,52747,"hello, and i hope i can clarify this for you. you are absolutely correct in the fact that the length of your cycle is related to when you ovulate... and your ovulation date is 14 days back from when you got your period, rather than counting 14 days from the start of your period. it is typical for most women to have a 14-day luteal phase, as you suggested. you absolutely may ovulate later in your cycle. i do not know how long you and your partner have tried to conceive before trying closed. i would not recommend trying closed at all unless you have tried for a year (meaning unprotected sex at least 2-3 times per week) and not become pregnant. a reproductive endocrinologist is an appropriate referral if you have a history of infertility for one year, and if you fail at least 3 cycles of closed. they can prescribe closed and combine it with intrauterine insemination, which can increase the success rate. even though you may have had a child together before, there can be an issue with the male partner too, and it would be advisable he gets his sperm count evaluated. but you can still have conceived this cycle if you ovulated on the closed, and continued to have unprotected sex at least a week after your ovulation kit showed positive. your progesterone level pre-ovulation is not relevant at all. so- if you don't get a period by day 35 or so, do a pregnancy test. and if you didn't conceive this cycle, a reproductive endocrinologist might be a better choice to manage your closed. i hope this answered your question, and best of luck in getting pregnant. take care,"

i or . a was having stomach pains and took the hyospamol pills and planning to fall pregnant a a on my ovulation days can this affect my chances of becoming pregnant as a have been trying for almost 2 years to fall pregnant after my 1st child .. thanks,2,108096,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. it is true that theoretically you should have been clear of the injection within three months of discontinuation, however many women after being a depo-provera for a long time do not resume having ovulatory, regular, menstrual cycles until 6 to 9 months or even up to a year after discontinuation. unfortunately, it is difficult to artificially induce ovulation in women who are coming off depo-provera. if you were not trying to become pregnant, your cycle could be regulated temporarily with birth control pills, but if you're actually trying to get pregnant the best thing you can do with this point is to just keep trying and wait and see. if you feel any symptoms of pregnancy, and you haven't gotten your period for a while, i would do pregnancy test just to make sure. there is always a possibility even if your periods are not regular that you do ovulate sometimes. so in summary, continue having unprotected sex every other to every three days and give it some more time. 80% of couples will conceive within one year, and if after a year of trying you and your partner are unsuccessful, it might be a good idea to see a fertility specialist for an evaluation. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes, and good luck getting pregnant,"

(would you be having it then?) now your cycle is of 30 days period. so the expected date of ovulation should be 07 january. hence, if the conception takes place on 07 january, the due date of delivery would be 30 september. the hitch here is that you should have ovulation taking lace on 07 january. moreover, we have noticed that all the pregnancies do not last for 280 days. the delivery can take place any time between 3 weeks earlier to 1 week later than the expected due date of delivery. keeping these facts and calculations in mind, you may plan your sexual relations accordingly. i hope this will help you."

by heart was beating erratically in my chest that it was moving my chest on its own and my throat started to feel like it was tightening . this lasted about fifteen minutes . cd like to now what that is . pm fourteen and a have high blood pressure as well .,1,25338,"hello and thank you for using chat doctor. i carefully read your question and understand your concern. but you should not worry, its nothing serious. as you describe, my opinion is that it might be a rhythm issue. someone can feel strong and fast heart beats for different reasons. it may be a simple sinus tachycardia. this means that the heart is beating faster than 100 beats for minute. its normal range in a resting condition is between 60-100 beats for minute. when it goes up you may feel a strong heart beat in your chest and a sensation like your body is beating too. another reason for this sensation might be what we call an ekstrasystol.these is electrical heart impulses that generates in some parts of heart different from normal sinus rhythm. this generates an escaped beat that the person feels like jumping ore bumping. it gives the sensation like a beat is skipping, may experience palpitations or an anxiety sensation that your daughter explains like trembling. this extrasistoles may happen from different reasons from simple emotional stress to other pathologies like anemia, hyperthyroidism etc. so, my opinion as cardiologist is that you have nothing to worry. it is just a simple episode, and it is quite normal in younger ages. only if these symptoms persist and begins to interfere the daily live, if i was your treating doctor i will recommend some examinations like a blood analysis to exclude anemia, the thyroid hormones, an electrocardiogram, echocardiography and of course a holder monitoring. this will help us to document and see what happens with heart rhythm. at meantime, i will recommend your daughter to avoid coffee, caffeine products because they rise heart frequency and extrasistolic beats. i encourage her to have physical training because sometimes it helps in reducing extrasistoles, tachycardia, even making them disappear. wish i was helpful. take good care. best regards"

a have been taking cetalopram 20 my a day for almost two years . it the moment a am living in a country where this kind of medicine is not regularly available . it will also not be possible for me to legally receive it from another country . that shall a do ? may any damage occur due to cancellation of its intake ?,1,43362,"hello thanks for posting here. i have gone through your description. your bp seems to be persistently higher despite taking amlodipine daily. verapamil is a stronger blood control medication than amlodipine. but one of its effects is lowering the heart rate, which in your case was lowered too much hence stopped. the amlodipine you are taking is not enough to control your bp and hence it must be changed. if you were my patient, i would start you on tablet selma am which is a combination of telmisartan plus amlodipine which would be an ideal combination for you. it does not lower the heart rate and has beneficial effects on the kidney and heart. the brand name selma am may change from country to country, but telmisartan 40 mg plus amlodipine 5 mg combinations are available worldwide. you can take one tablet of selma am. it will definitely help get your pressure under control. if despite this your blood pressure remains high (after two weeks of starting selma am) you must undergo a 24-hour ambulatory bp monitoring which records your bp every 15-20 mins while you go around your daily routine activities. it gives us an idea of your pressure control, effect of medications, time of day when pressure is high, and also we can correlate high blood pressure with the activity you were doing at that time. so to proceed further, please take the telmisartan amlodipine combination i have advice for two weeks and then follow up. wishing you good health. regards"

"hello , by wife was pregnant . today the doctor told her the baby vanished . the only thing i could find on line about this was vanishing twin syndrome . be were not told before this that she had twins . to how can vanishing happen with only one fetus . thank you .",1,97281,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. many women accidentally ingest medications or alcohol before they find out that they are pregnant. however, there is no fetus that even develops before the 7th week or so, so the effects of medications on a developing fetus would not yet be able to pose any harm to the pregnancy. furthermore, there are only a few, very strong iv antibiotics that can actually cause significant harm to a developing fetus. so it is unlikely that the antibiotic that your wife was taking was even unsafe during pregnancy. asking whether a woman is pregnant when prescribing medication is a common routine practice and does not mean that the medication prescribed is in any way. so in summary, i do not think you need to be worried about the medication your wife took in this very early stage. to enhance the health of her pregnancy, she should follow a well-balanced diet, avoid alcohol, and begin to take a vitamin supplement designed for pregnant women. your should also choose a prenatal care provider for her and have your first visit about a month from now. i hope i was able to adequate;y answer your question today, and that my advice was reassuring. best wishes,"

hi my daughter complained over the summer with itchy feet . she he little white spots on the sole of her feet . they to me looked like little sweat spots and a advised her to stop wearing socks in bed and let air at them . however she has come down from bed night complaining her feet are sore and she cant sleep . live checked them gain and these soft stops that were previously there remain however they are hard to touch and plain white in colour . any advise would a great . louise,1,30569,i think that the swollen feet are a direct function of her walking about as much as all day long possibly. because she is in the middle stages of alzheimer's she is likely not easy to keep down or to get to stay still for any length of time in order to elevate her feet. it doesn't sound as if she has a primary congestive heart problem or kidney failure from the way you're describing things. she simply walks over abundantly and does not take the time off to get her feet up. there are specific medications for alzheimer's disease (non-tremendously affective i might add) but all the same you may check with your doctor to see if any of them may be of some benefit to her in terms of getting her to be a little more settled so that she can take appropriate breaks and help the swelling of the feet down.

hi .. i had septorhinoplasty some time ago but still experience breathing difficulty thru my left nostril . i can do heavy weights as a result of this . at night i need to sleep on my left side so that i can breath better .. the of said it could be a result of underlying allergies before surgery that are causing a prophase ?,1,98224,"hi ! your operation was done 8 months ago for bilateral inguinal hernia. now you are feeling the same old sensation on the left side only. have you noticed any type of swelling on your inguinal area just as you had before the surgery? if it so, then it could be a recurrence of the hernia on the left side. but due to improvement in the surgical techniques laparoscopically, this is a remote chance even though possible. the other possibility is entrapment of nerve or adhesion of the mesh with any other abdominal viscera, or fibrosis at the site of surgery. if there is no swelling, and not any major problem, you can wait for some more time, and see if the problem subsides of its own. otherwise, you will have to get yourself reviewed by the operating surgeon. wishing you an early recovery."

"hello , a have a little lump a can feel in my lower abdomen on the right side that is a little tender when a push on it . a have not noticed this before . would it be a swollen lymph node ? a am on my period , would that make a difference ? is this something to be concerned about ?",1,67521,"hi there, a lump in your neck during an ear infection is most commonly an enlarged lymph node. a number of things can cause lymph nodes to become enlarged, but in the vast majority of the time, the cause is an infection. other causes can be malignancy, but this is much rarer. if the lymph node is tender, it makes malignancy much more unlikely. i'd take ibuprofen and use warm compresses on the affected area. if the lymph node gets smaller, i wouldn't worry about it at all. if it continues to be enlarged, hardened and painless, then i would seek out an ultrasound. again, i'd give it a week after your other symptoms resolve before i'd start to worry. i hope this answers your question. feel free to contact me if you have any other questions."

hi- a went for a mammogram and an ultra sound today because a found a large hard lump in my right breast on monday . they did the mammogram and ultrasound and then decided to do a biopsy today . the lump found was 4.5cm and was described as a rubber golf ball . they had a very difficult time getting the biopsy because the lump was so hard and they could to get into it . a am very worried that this is cancerous and a am worried about how long a have had it since it is so large . any input would be appreciated .,1,82366,"hello friend, thank you for posting your query through chat doctor. i am a homeopath answering your query and the answer which i am going to give you may contain several thoughts which may appear strange or new for you. this i say because homeopathy is a new system of medicine and is almost unheard by the majority of the population. therefore, due to the high influence of the conventional medicine the people at large are brainwashed to believe and act according to the health education given by them. coming back to the fibroadenoma of your left breast in the year 1979, you had a psychological conflict in the mind level. you are a sensitive individual and that is why your left breast was affected. it must have been related with your child chat doctor. the sensitivity is genetic, and you reacted to the conflict through the brain according to a genetic programming. mind-brain - organ affection resulted in the development of a lump in your left breast in 1979. you consulted your gynecologist, and he suggested that it may turn to become cancerous in future and so it is better to remove it, and you subdued to his suggestion. actually the lump in the breast was an attempt of the body to cure you, or it was the result of a self defense mechanism. since you had not resolved the conflict in the psychological level, the lump remained there without getting resolved. but the body kept the lump protected in a cyst with minimum amount of inflammation called chronic cystitis. by removing the fibroadenoma or chronic cystic mastitis, you were not cured, but your lump in the breast was removed. in 1995 also you are the same person, you are the same sensitive person, and you underwent another more serious psychological conflict and the same left breast was again affected in a more serious manner. instead of recognizing the mass as a defense mechanism, you got the fear in you that you have cancer. the tissue changes also suggested that there is more serious pathology, and they labelled your lump this time as cancer and suggested removal of your left breast. if you could have recognized the lump as a defense mechanism and if you had no fear of cancer, you could have retained your breast. but the fear of cancer is such that it is associated with death and so you lost your breast. in no case, either by removal of lump in 1979 or by removal of your breast in 1995, you are not cured only your disease is cured. hope by this time you have got the answer for your query. both are related to each other because they are in the same individual, same sensitivity, same program. homeopathy cures the person and once the individual is cured all his diseases will be cured. with best wishes,"

hi i am 25 or female i am having burning after urination in morning ... in my urine c/s it shows e.coli significant ...... i took nitrofurontoine 100mg last night and after 6 hours of taking that i feel slight pain at kidney .... there was no burning in urine passage but still i have slight pain in kidneys,1,34445,"hi, thanks for writing in. the collecting system of the kidney is made of renal calyxes and pelvis. this collects the urine formed in kidney and transports it through the ureter (tubes connecting kidneys and urinary bladder) to the urinary bladder. the pelvicalyceal system is the mouth of the kidney where it connects with the upper end of the ureter. i guess that you have got ultrasound scan done, and it shows mild fullness of the pelvicalyceal system in the left kidney, that is a term applied to increase in diameter of the collecting system in your left kidney. it is not a critical situation, and please do not worry if you do not have any urinary symptoms. since it is mentioned as mild fullness and no kidney stones have been found, therefore(i) it can be that your bladder was completely full at the of ultrasound scan(ii) your kidney pelvicalyceal system is appearing full by itself (extrarenal pelvis) and is an extension of normal appearance.(iii) rarely an infection of urinary system and kidneys (recent or old) can cause such a finding, but this is likely only if you have symptoms like pain in the region of kidney and problems like burning urination or discoloration of urine or any kidney infections in the past.(iv) stones in kidney or ureter can also cause fullness of pelvicalyceal system and since you do not have any stone therefore this does not apply to you. it is important to know if your scan was repeated after passing urine and still there was persistent mild fullness of the pelvicalyceal system on left side. this can also be confirmed by doing an mvp which is injecting a contrast and taking 5 to 6 x-rays to study the functioning of the kidneys in a better way. please consult the urologist."

i just stood up and went really dizzy . i couldn't see anything and stood against the wall so i didst fall . all of a sudden my whole body started shaking and i could feel my legs giving up on me and were shaking until i managed to slide down the wall and sit down . i done know what just happened to me,1,41571,"hello, unfortunately for physicians ""shaking"" is a very vague term, and it could mean many kinds of movements, ranging from tremulousness of the body, to flailing, to arrhythmic shaking to rhythmic shaking and all have very different implications. however, i will give you the most common cause of what you saw. most likely what occurred is called ""convulsive syncope"" which means that when you pass out you have some jerking movements, but it is not considered a seizure. what happens is that blood flow is disrupted to the brain and the person loses consciousness. because the nerve cells are suddenly deprived of oxygen, they fire abnormally for a few times causing body jerking, but when the person collapses blood flow is restored and the movements stop. so essentially the movements are caused by passing out and not by a seizure. likely what happened also was what we call a ""vasovagal reaction"" in which due to stress, emotional response among other things, the blood vessels dilate and blood rushed down from the head into the legs causing a person to pass out. the classic example of this is when a person who is getting their blood chat doctor. it is not considered abnormal, and can happen to anybody. lastly, just to describe what a true seizure looks like. typically, what happens is that a person will first stiffen up, the eyes will turn up into the head with the eyes remaining open. there is often a very loud scream due to the abdominal muscles tensing up and expelling air from the lungs. the stiffening phase is then followed by a rhythmic, whole body shaking. when i say rhythmic i mean that the jerks occur at regular intervals and at the same time in all extremities of the body. the gradually slow down and the person becomes limp and often is breathing very hard. when they wake up there is almost always confusion that lasts several minutes and then slowly the person returns to their normal state of mind. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

hello my wife is 6 weeks pregnant . her chatdoctor level was a bit low . but everything was fine . suddenly around 3 days ago spotting appeared .. but we took it lightly and she was on a complete bed rest . today we had an intercourse . but very gently . and suddenly sort of a bleeding started .. light pinkish .. but was fluid not viscous . please recommend something,1,8772,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the proper way to use the nearing is to put it in, leave it in for 3 weeks, take it out, wait one week, and replace it. during the week you are not wearing the ring, you should have some bleeding that is considered a menstrual cycle. if you wore the ring continuously for two months and then had a new one replaced but only removed it 3 days later, the pinkish spotting was your ""period"", which is caused by not wearing the ring. the bleeding was very light because you had suppressed it by continuously wearing the ring for over 2 months. so you should expect your next period about 4-5 weeks after the episode of spotting that you had. if you do not have menses by then, i recommend repeating the pregnancy test at that time. if you did not have regular monthly cycles before you used the ring, your cycle will follow your regular pattern that you typically have when not using hormonal contraception. if you are trying to get pregnant, you should have intercourse about every other day and begin taking prenatal vitamins as it benefits the health of the baby for the vitamins to be present at conception. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"hi , my toddler has red small raised bumps in clusters on her leg starting to spread to her other leg with a little spot and a tiny one on her belly now . to other symptoms that a know of or that she is displaying . that could this be ? the also had bad eczema when she was a baby but has not had it since and it is raised like that but looks lot different .",1,108227,"hi. if you contract the infection, you can transmit it to your baby shortly before birth and this can also be controlled or avoided if the medical team is a little more careful. but if you do not have it, and only your toddler has/had it, then there is little chance your unborn baby will get it. so it may be best to keep your toddler hospitalized, until he/she recovers completely, and avoid contact with him/her until he/she does. best wishes."

"had routine `` old '' cavities replaced in late april . very tender/sore gum near one tooth . had it re-check a few weeks later . dentist performed ray on affected tooth and found nothing . said my bit was off and did some routine filing of the tooth and said it would be better in a few days . this week my gum is sore , tooth is sore , cheek is swollen and slightly bruised and a woke up with a small white head on a bubble atop the affected tooth",1,53390,hi. can understand your concern. as per your complaint the swollen gum and the white material inside it is a result of some inflammation. there can be a few reasons depending upon whether it is the second molar or the wisdom tooth. in case it is a wisdom tooth which is erupting or is impacted then the gum above it can get infected and inflamed due to either food deposition between the gum and the wisdom tooth or it can be due to gum flap bitten by the opposite jaw tooth and the condition is known as peritonitis. the white material in it is pus. in case it is second molar the swollen gum with white material in it can be as a result of infection in the gums due to deposits on the teeth like plaque or calculus or due to foreign body impaction in the gums which carries infection along with it deeper into the gums causing pus formation. it can also be due to deeply infected tooth causing pus formation below the tips of the roots of the tooth causing swelling on the gums with pus inside. i would suggest you to consult a dentist and get evaluated for the exact cause of the swelling and get treated accordingly. in case if it is wisdom tooth either excision of gum flap or extraction if the tooth is impacted followed by antibiotics and painkillers can be done. in case of gum infection professional cleaning of teeth followed by antibiotics and gum paints can help. in case of tooth infection root canal treatment or extraction depending on the condition of the tooth can be done. hope your query is solved. if you find the answer helpful please write a positive review and click on find this answer helpful as a token of appreciation. thanks and regards. chat doctor.

(symptoms of delirium include confusion, disorientation, disturbance in the sleep-wake cycle and hallucinations) as regards the treatment, anxiolytic are not the specific treatment of choice for hallucinations. he may need to be started on anti-psychotics, but again, this has to be on a low dose and given with caution, because anti-psychotics have a risk of worsening his parkinson's symptoms. i would suggest that you take him for a consultation with a psychiatrist, who would be able to make a detailed assessment and advice appropriate treatment. all the best. -"

a had a root canal in february and my jaw hinge was soba it cracks and pops feels like my jaw is got the a wen to to dentist twice both dentists said a grind gave me night guard pain is sort of gone now a have rash around my face and numbness around my chin and pain in gum line on that side still cant open mouth all the way what is wrong,1,44715,"hello, i can understand your concern. it would have been helpful if you had mentioned which tooth was treated for root canal. as you are mentioning that the tooth was black and had cracks in it, i am assuming that the tooth is in the lower front region, and you had had some trauma to the lower jaw area which made the tooth dead and also hurt the chin and lip. other possibility is that if the tooth was dead for many years, it may have developed a periapical cyst in relation with the tooth which might be pressing on the mental nerve supplying lower lip and chin and may cause numbness of those areas. alternatively, the numbness may have started after taking local anesthesia in the lower front area for some tooth problem and the injection might have been given deep. in any case, it seems that the nerve supplying sensation to the lower front area of jaw along with lower lip and chin (mental nerve) is damaged. usually, if the nerve is damaged, it can regenerate in 3-6 months and the sensations can return. if you are not sure regarding the crown on the tooth, you can avoid it for some months and take care not to bite hard things with that tooth so that it does not fracture. you can get the crown after the numbness is solved. i would also advise you to visit an oral and maxillofacial surgeon for the examination of the area and regarding numbness. he/she might take an x-ray to rule out presence of periapical lesion or cyst in relation with the tooth. crown should surely be postponed until this possibility is ruled out. i hope this information helps you. thank you for choosing chat doctor. i wish you feel better soon. best,"

by son was diagnosed with a single mastocytoma ? a was told that it was not serious and would go away on it a own . should a be concerned about allergies ? be is not allergic to any foods that a know of and has had seafood and all types of nuts already . the only reactions he has had is to one of his vaccines which cleared up after a dose of benadryl and he also tends to react to mosquito bites ( more swelling than usual ) . be will be two at the end of january and we noticed his mastocytoma about 6 months ago .,1,105897,"hi. to begin with, the treatment that your husband has undergone seems to be correct medically, more or less. to begin with he was suffering from locally advanced prostate cancer which was downstage and then surgically removed. however, he had a relapse of his disease in the bones and was placed on hormonal treatment. he seemed to be suffering from hormone resistant prostate cancer which can occur in 10% patients to start with. thus, he failed to respond to most of the treatments and eventually died of his disease. at every stage of progression, doing a scan is not mandatory. just a rising psa and symptoms are enough to know that the disease is progressing. doing a scan only documents that the disease has spread to a particular part. it will neither change the treatment nor the outcome. the blood was basically because of 2 reasons. one the disease in the lung which can commonly lead to bleeding on its own of varying quantity. added to that was the fact that he was in liver failure which further increases the chances of bleeding from any site. zynga has many side effects and one has to weigh the risks against the benefits and take a call. i assume, and you should to that the call to give zynga despite liver failure by your doctor was in good faith and based on sound judgement. i think the only part where your doctor failed you entirely was by not keeping you informed at every step the prognosis, the treatment options, the disease status and the likely outcome. it is something that i would have done and is nothing but unfortunate. while it would not have changed the outcome of your husband, it might have left you in peace after his demise. hope my answer takes care of your unrest in some measure, and you find strength enough to move on in life. take care"

"hi i a nancy , i am 30years and have been married for four years.we have also been trying to get pregnant but all seems abortive .i also been missing my monthly periods some times but for the past 1and a half years it has been normal.i went to see a gone he sent me for an ultrasound which showed i have bulky ovaries and partially located in the pouch of douglas and they are polysystic.i a scared because i really need to get pregnant and have my baby.my husband also has low sperm count of less than i million and the motility is low ? pleas i need your advice.thanks email : yyyy @ yyyy",1,43820,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, i want to reassure you that no matter what your endometrial measurement may be, 80% of couples will conceive within one year naturally. couples are not diagnosed as infertile until you have been trying and been unable to become pregnant for over one year. endometrial thickness is really only relevant in the context of couples trying to get pregnant through in vitro fertilization. the thickness of your uterine lining is somewhat related to your estrogen levels. when couples are undergoing ivf, treating with additional estrogen can thicken the uterine lining. however, because you've been only trying to get pregnant for four months, your endometrial lining may have absolutely nothing to do with the reason why you have not yet conceived. furthermore, unless your husbands' sperm count has been shown to be decreased, magazine should not have any effect on fertility nor should affect any health of a developing baby should you conceive. medications taken during pregnancy by the mother can affect the fetus, but not any medication taken by the father, because medication cannot be transmitted before fertilization through sperm. so unless the medication causes the sperm count to be low or abnormal, there is no medical reason why your husband needs to be off his medication for colitis in order for you and need to conceive successfully. i suggest that if he needs the medication for his health that he continue to take it. as for is maximizing your chance of healthy pregnancy, the best thing you can do is get plenty of sleep, eat a well-balanced diet, take prenatal vitamins, and tried to have regular(at least 2 to 3 days a week) unprotected intercourse from the time your menstrual period finishes until you begin to feel premenstrual symptoms. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and i wish you and your husband the best of luck in conceiving. best wishes,"

my father is unconscious he had a operation in march of brain haematoma .. but now last week he had attacked of epilepsy and mri shows that there is a neoplastic lesion in right posterior parietal region .. so i have to ask that what should have to do now ? ? is neurosurgery is risky again or there would be another option of treatment ? his age is about 60 years,1,6507,"hi, thanks for writing in. it is important to review his earlier report and then proceed with current diagnosis. a brain hematoma is an area of bleed for which he had a surgery. it is important to know if the epilepsy and neoplastic lesion on mri are in the same area as the hematoma or at a different location. neoplasm is a general term used to describe a tumor. complete review of his mri is essential and that will tell the exact size of the tumor, location (?right posterior parietal region) and the pressure effect it is causing on the brain. an electroencephalogram can also be done to know what exactly caused his epilepsy. that way we can assess if going for surgery is the best treatment or if other choices can be made. doing another surgery is not a big risk, but it is important to know the probable nature of what is seen in the mri and if it is related to the earlier surgery he had last year."

"hello . about a month ago my doctor discovered a have gall bladder polyps size of 0.5 pm and said to wait until aug/sept . so see for any changes . a week ago a went for my annual gino check up and discovered a have 3 cysts on a right ovary . are the two related ? a year ago a was fine , and now all this . an a take birth control pill to help reduce the ovarian cyst ? but then a read that birth control pill may have something to do with formation of gall bladder polyps .",1,23404,"thanks for your question. it is important to realize that if you are sexually active, there is always the chance of pregnancy, even if you are using birth control. oral contraceptives are, in fact, 99% effective. they are so effective that if 100 women used a birth control pill as directed, only one of them would become pregnant in any given year. however, that is still 1 percent of women pregnant using a birth control pill as directed. birth control pill doses have gotten much lighter over the past twenty years, so formation of ovarian cysts is still possible. i did a study on this several years ago, showing that women may still form ovarian cysts on lighter dose birth control pills, although they usually do not ovulate. that is the mechanism for prevention of pregnancy. ovarian cysts can make hormones which may produce symptoms in women that mimic pregnancy. a pregnancy test for you is in order and your gynecologist may also recommend an ultrasound of the pelvis to detect any ovarian cyst formation. hormone production from the ovary may also produce the light spotting you are experiencing. remember, however, that any amount of bleeding on a birth control pill may signify a menstrual period. menstrual periods on birth control pills are chat doctor. i hope this answers your questions. i am available for further consultation if needed."

"hi thanks for your time my question is what is best for breakthrough pain i am taking 145mg methadone in two daily split oses it does help but i get bad electric shocks down back and front of my right leg and my knee is real sore too as is my big toe and on the outside of my foot it is sort of pins and needles and my bum goes to sleep but atm its the burning and the shocks that are killing me i believe i dislocated l4 , l5 facet joints and think i may also have nerve root involvement i am miserable",1,13930,"hello, and thank you for your question. fortunately, you probably do not have fibromyalgia. there are several possible causes of pain just in the toe. if there is a pinched nerve in the lower spine, it can cause pain that can be just in one toe. if this is the case, you may find that the pain is worse with change in position, such as lying flat or standing up. pain in the toe, typically the big toe, is common in a disorder called gout, in which the body has too much uric acid. the pain usually lasts a few days at a time, and is usually associated with redness and swelling. pain in the toes can be caused by corns or other skin problems that look small but feel very severe. pins and needles, shooting, on-and-off pains can be caused by irritation to a nerve by diabetes, by lack of vitamins such as b12, or by pressure - similar to the ""foot falling asleep"" feeling we sometimes get if we cross our legs too long. fibromyalgia, on the other hand, is usually a ""pain all over"" problem - back pain, neck pain, arm pain, knee pain, without another cause such as arthritis. it usually does not cause just one part of the body to hurt - most patients say that ""everything hurts"". in my practice, i start with finding out as much as i can from the patient about how the pain feels and how long it has been going on, and if it seems related to anything else. then we examine the foot to look for anything going on with the skin, check if the nerves of the foot are normally sensitive, not as sensitive as usual, or more sensitive, and then we may check blood tests to detect diabetes or vitamin deficiency or other problems as needed. fibromyalgia is diagnosed by obtaining a careful history of where the patient is having pain, other medical problems, and completing a physical exam including what is called a ""painful point"" exam where the doctor pushes at certain places in the body - on the back and near the joints - to see if this causes pain. i hope that my answer to your question is helpful. if you have any further questions, please check back with us. i hope your toe is much better soon."

in just finished 6 chemotherapy treatments ( 3 weeks apart ) for fallopian tub cancer . the treatment is the same as is for ovarian sgot is 48 and my sgpt is 94 . would the elevated numbers be due to the chemotherapy ? hats your opinion on this ? valerie,3,77890,"it would have helped if you had told me about the stage of your cancer in 2010 at initial diagnosis. ovarian cancer is a bad disease and is known to recur. the good thing is that you have had an almost 3 year of disease-free interval which tells me that your cancer was responsive to the chemotherapy (this is called platinum sensitive disease, platinum being the active ingredient of the chemotherapy) and has a much better prognosis than platinum-resistant disease. hence, you should immediately start on the same chemotherapy as before without delay (carbonation + paclitaxel). any delay is going to allow your tumor to grow and spread to other parts. biopsy is a simple procedure and can be done at any cancer hospital as an old or daycare procedure. so that is no reason to delay your treatment. i don't think it is anybody's fault, just the nature of this cancer and its tendency to recur. you should start chemotherapy immediately and if after chemotherapy there is a residual lesion that can be surgically removed, then you should undergo subsequent surgery as well."

a have been suffering pm backpack for last two years which is so severe during my menstrual time . sometimes it prolongs after that also . did gynaec check ups and everything normal . recently pain starts towards the centre of hip and spreads to lower abdominal side ( left ) . also a feel pain on my left leg . for the last 3 weeks much restriction in bending etc .. one day a felt some sort of numbness under the feet and it disappeared . now under medication . doctor said swelling on back joint . another or said some sort of gap near the lower disc . would you plus tell me what my actual palm is ?,1,21962,"dear simone, there is one rule for doctors here in croatia: when you think too much, stop, and think again, but this time think for the simplest diagnose. if you have pain in abdomen and an umbilical hernia seen on us then the first thing to think about is ""abdominal pain caused by hernia"":). there are many conditions in medicine where pain doesn't need to beau localized near the ""pathology"". sometimes pain can be felt on the opposite side of the affected organ. it is known that one of common symptom of myocardial infarction is pain in the left shoulder. also, infection of the abdominal organs can give many types and localizations of pain. the reason for it is simple: when i see pain, i see nerves, not organs (this is my own phrase:)). nerves conduct pain, and nerves are all around, going from periphery to the brain, so pain can be localized on its pathway, so just let's go back to your problem. doctor should tell you the size of hernia and its content which can be only preperitoneal tissue, momentum or even intestines. this dark triangle...mmm.it can be nothing and everything. i usually don't trust our ultrasonographer because they are strange people... sometimes they don't see what they need to see, or they see what they don't need to see. all i see is that us is operator-dependent diagnostic test... but we shouldn't underestimate this finding. it can be uterine moma, endometriosis, cyst or tumor. and yes, it can cause pain you're describing. so what you need to do: 1. ct scan of pelvic and abdominal region. why? as i said, these us findings are always doubtful, ct is a high sensitive test which will find the exact problem for sure. it will tell you the size and severity of hernia and the morphology of this uterine lesion. it can also find some other problems in its early phase."

my baby is 3years old and has been complaining of a sore upper soft palate for the past 3days . i have noticed upon viewing her mouth that it has a yellowish colour as well as her inner cheeks . she has no fever and is eating but complains about the the pain periodically and cries . please help,1,56216,"hi thanks for choosing chat doctor for your medical query. i'm sorry but your question is deficient in a lot of information that would have been very helpful for me to answer. you have not mentioned if this was the first episode of pain, or she has past history. you did not mention if she hd any accompanying symptoms like diarrhea, vomiting, blood in stool or vomits, fever, pallor or jaundice. was her abdomen tender to touch? has the pain gotten worse, or it has subsided in intensity? is it only present in the upper abdomen or has it shifted to some other area or extended further? you also did not specify which tests and scans were ordered and came out negative. i can infer that the pain was very severe from the fact that she was hospitalized. upper abdominal pain can be due to a number of causes she might have pancreatitis, cholecystitis or peptic ulcer. pancreatic enzyme levels, ultrasound scan and h pylori antigen should be performed to rule out these conditions. as you have mentioned she had work up done at a hospital so i assume she was evaluated for these conditions. if all other tests are normal she may have functional abdominal pain. it is common amongst girls between the ages of 5 years to 14 years. it is because of an altered mechanism for pain perception so that the affected individual is more sensitive to pain. no definitive cause for this pain can be found but that does not mean it's not real. it usually presents in anxious child chat doctor. it is usually accompanied by other symptoms like recurrent diarrhea, constipation and headaches. the usual sites are around the umbilicus and in the upper abdomen. if your child has been worked up fully for all serious condition the best course of action is to reassure her. try to eliminate stress as much as possible, incorporate soluble fibers in her diet. probiotics are also helpful. do not limit her activities due to pain and try not to let her miss school. talk to her teachers and explain to them the situation. do not dismiss her pain as nothing, acknowledge its presence but try to make your child see that she has to continue her activities in a normal fashion. hope my answer helps you if you have any father questions i would be happy to answer."
my baby is 3years old and has been complaining of a sore upper soft palate for the past 3days . i have noticed upon viewing her mouth that it has a yellowish colour as well as her inner cheeks . she has no fever and is eating but complains about the the pain periodically and cries . please help,2,92899,"hi. can understand your concern. as per your complaint cough and vomiting sensation in a patient who is wearing a new denture but is not used to it as you said that she is wearing denture for three decades. it is very clear from it that she does not have a problem of gag reflex, and she can tolerate the denture well. the reason which is causing her the discomfort can be that her new denture must be over-extended deep onto the soft palate and any movement like the normal swallowing of the saliva also leads to stimulation of the sensitive soft palate and can lead to coughing and vomiting feeling. the extension at the palatal end should also be checked for thickness as very thick margins also lead to discomfort. one reason can be that if the denture is not fitting well, and it moves with slight movement of the mouth this also leads to palatal stimulation and gagging. any space between the denture surface and the surface of palate can lead to food debris accumulation and loosening of denture, and it can cause discomfort. in case if she is using any denture adhesive and if it does not suit the body there are chances that it can also cause the above explained symptoms. i would suggest you to consult the dentist and explain the immediate symptoms and get checked for the extensions and thinning and reducing the extent of the extensions or change in adhesive can provide her relief from the symptoms. hope this information helps. if you find the answer helpful please write a positive review and click on find this answer helpful as a token of appreciation. thanks and regards. chat doctor."

"i a have a large lump on my left temple near my hairline . it a painful to touch , feels almost like a bruise . a also have a headache and a hard moveable lump where my ear meets my jaw . a a wondering if it a a swollen lymph node . these both have appeared within the last few days . any idea what a a dealing with ?",1,12056,"hi. thanks for the query. a hard painless lump under the jaw can be due to a number of reasons like 1. if it is a painless and freely movable lump it can be due to lymph node swelling which is commonly seen in case of near of distant infection in the body.2. if it is a diffused swelling which increase during eating it can be due to blocked duct of submandibular salivary gland.3. a swollen lymph node can be due to malignant changes in lymph nodes leading to formation of a lymphoma. i would suggest you to consult an oral pathologist if surgeon is not available and get evaluated. in case if it is due to blocked salivary duct removal of obstruction can help... in case it is a lymph node, and you do not have any ongoing or recent history of infection then a biopsy of the lymph node has to be done to confirm the diagnosis. hope this helps. regards."

yes one morning a work up and had pain in my left calve and then noticed swelling in my inside lower leg but not all the way around went to doctor first he said kidney disease then a did a urine sample and that was to the case then went for a ultra sound for blood clot it came back negative ... the ultrasound woman said she believed it was cellulitis but a took antibiotics it did to help ... my problem is that it almost goes away except small amount of fluid and some hardness under the skin . it still swells up time to time . but never completely goes away . always a can push on my shin area and there is little fluid in which when a push in it leaves a dent ... what could this be,1,27904,"hi, thanks for writing in. hematomas are collections of blood under the skin. it is important to know the exact location of the hematoma and if it is superficial or deep. hematoma is formed due to pooling of blood. if left alone, the blood components will separate and leave the fluid in the location. if this happens then the fluid can be easily aspirated under ultrasound guidance using a small needle. this is a non-surgical approach and works in many patients. most of the fluid is taken out, and a little amount left inside will get absorbed on its on. if it has calcified then it is difficult to remove using a needle. doing a ct scan or ultrasound of the area will help in knowing if there is calcification."

"a had my gallbladder removed laparoscopic on thursday . 4 days later a have a small irritation in my throat causing me to cough . when a cough some phlegm comes up with a small amt id red blood mixed ( bright red ) . the breathing tube was left in longer than usual due to shallow breaths , causing a panic attack . should a be concerned ?",1,54619,"hi there, im sorry your granddaughter is having some health issues. let me explain each item in the report with the information you've provided me. phagocytosis are abnormal types of blood cells that are round instead of the usual disc shape. this can be quite common in patients with sickle cell anemia, as the body pushes out immature red blood cells due to the shortage of normal functioning blood cells. the spleen digests red blood cells that are normal, and in cases of sickle cell or other hematologic disease, can become enlarged due to the fact that it is working harder. if your granddaughter is very anemic or having low platelets, sometimes a splenectomy (removal of the spleen is warranted). if she's not having any difficulty with anemia or bleeding, then leaving the spleen in is an option. when red blood cells get broken down at an increased rate, this can cause gallstones to form in the gallbladder, which can also cause liver enzymes to be elevated. i don't believe that her kidney infection or type 1 diabetes are related to her sickle cell anemia, but if she's having recurrent abdominal pain (sickle cell crisis) and gallstones, it may not be a bad idea to consider having her gallbladder and spleen removed at the same time. finally, a small uterus is nothing to be concerned about in a 9-year-old. this sounds like an incidental finding. i hope i have answered your questions. please feel free to contact me should you have any further questions."

i a had sex when a was ovulating and used the pull out method . a was supposed to start my period 5 days ago . a took a test the day after a was supposed to start but it was negative . would a still be pregnant ? a also threw up a few days before my start due date but a think it was due to a headache ?,1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"most of my adult life a have had sensitivity to environmental allergies , and food allergies , recently a have had three reactions .. that may deal with food and latex allergies ... a feel the redness and burning are causing more and more intense pain . a take benadryl immediately after exposure . is there anything else besides an dpi pin a can use to decrease the pain level . the intensity of pain to the top layer of skin is very off the chart pains . to a need to take a precaution ... often a do not know if food eaten or environment is the culprit . a firmly believe it is due to latex . a want to keep from anaphylaxis ... what preventative measures do a need to have in place ?",1,74504,"hello! thanks for using chat doctor.come read carefully your question and understand your concern. i think you had allergic to the latex condom spermicide. perhaps you are allergic to the latex condom, one of the most common allergic reactions caused by sexual intercourse. although they say it affects only 1% of people, you can actually develop the allergy or sensitivity to the condom with the progressive contact with the latex or the material from which the condom is made - and / or the lubricants and spermicides it contains. generally, the symptoms of the allergy to the condom appear within a few minutes of penetration, but then they may get worse. in cases of irritation, hives and more severe dermatitis occur hours later. for example, the formation of blisters on the skin that has been in contact with the latex is common. i see similar cases amongst young people who visit my clinic. in the first meeting, i advise my patients to avoid using latex condoms to prevent these symptoms, but obviously always remembering the important premise of practicing safe sex. if you are sensitive or allergic to latex, you can resort to polyurethane condoms or animal skin condoms. polyurethane condoms work in the same way as latex condoms: they offer protection against pregnancy and prevent sexually transmitted diseases. animal skin condoms, however, do not provide protection against stds. while commonly allergic to condoms is not too serious, exposing yourself to such symptoms over and over again can be both annoying and harmful and can compromise not only your sex life but your overall health. and here the situation can be worse. so the best advice i can give you is to consult with your urologist properly diagnose your case, analyze what risks you have been exposed to in contact with latex condoms, and of course know what other contraceptive methods you can use that are harmless and comfortable. kind regards,"

what are the possible reasons to explain why a experienced dizziness and fell to the floor injuring myself because a was unable to stand up or maintain consciousness after getting out of the bathtub ? did a faint and/or lose consciousness ? what should a do to prevent this from happening again ?,1,91232,"hi, there is a medical condition called cough syncope which means that a person passes out (loses consciousness) when they cough very forcefully or become spastic in their coughing (one cough after another without being able to stop). what happens is that there is pressure inside the head that is built up with the cough (or series of coughs) that prevents blood from flowing through the carotid arteries into the brain stem itself. when blood flow to the brain stem is interrupted in this way a person can temporarily lose consciousness. in your case, you didn't quite lose consciousness because there wasn't enough pressure to completely stop all blood flow to the brain stem. the treatment is to discover what is causing the cough and to treat that entity. eliminate the cough...or cough spasms... and you won't nearly pass out. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

i my daughter has a sprained ankle ( lateral ) she did it 5days age . it is still quite swollen but i am concerned it is very cold to touch . be iced for 72 hours and elevation and crutches . is the cold normal or should i get it checked by a doctor ? thanks,1,28201,"hello, and thank you for using chat doctor ! from your description of the events it is very unlikely that she is pregnant. if you want to be sure, it is very simple and inexpensive to get an over the counter urine pregnancy test. the brief period of penetration is enough to cause pregnancy in some cases, but since she took emergency contraception so soon afterward, this is very unlikely. emergency contraception is quite effective when used up to 72 hours after unprotected sex. however, it is not recommended to be used regularly, because of side effects such as irregular vaginal bleeding. having said this, your girlfriend still needs to make an appointment to be seen by her doctor. the thick white discharge that you are describing could be caused by a yeast infection, or it could be caused by a sexually transmitted disease (std). the most common std in women is chlamydia. if untreated this can lead to sterility, so it is very important that she be treated appropriately for whatever is causing her symptoms. i hope i have given you some useful information, and wish you the best of health. sincerely,"

"hi , i have been taking bear for a couple of months now but i moved to another country where they only have jasmine as contraceptive pills so i have no choice ! i just got my period and i have to start taking the pill on the 5th day as normal . my question is if it is of to switch from bear to jasmine and if it will have any side effect ? and if it is not possible what is another solution ?",1,6779,"hayes, it is okay to switch from bear to yasmin. there is no problem or harm with shifting to yasmin. both are combined estrogen and progesterone containing contraceptive pills. yasmin has similar side effects as bear. start taking the yasmin pill from today itself for better protection. if it is more than seven days since you completed bear use back up contraceptive method (like condoms) for one week. your body may take some time to adjust to the medicines in the different brand. so don't be alarmed if you develop spotting in between. i hope i have answered to your satisfaction"

(before the pills) i recommend :-wait for another week after the placebos are over. if no period, take a pregnancy test. if negative wait for another week and see your organ to check any hormonal imbalances or functional ovarian cysts (which are benign) that could be causing the delay in periods. some irregularities in menstrual cycle and flow is expected while starting the pill (about 3 months). this regulates over time. to answer your question specifically - no it is unlikely to get pregnant while on the placebos if you have been taking the pills regularly. the timing of the placebos coincides with the period after ovulation. hence, no fertilization can occur. hope this helps. please let me know if there is anything else i can help you with. wish you good health"

i doctor i am 7 weeks pregnant . a see brown discharge from last tuesday .. by doctor said its normal and they did ultrasound and said baby is 5weeks 5days . now long will i have this brown discharge ? ? is my baby safe ? ? this is my first pregnancy . a also have tight motion and i see slight blood .what needs to be done to avoid these and is this normal during pregnancy ? ?,1,98507,"hallow dear, brown discharge per magnum during any stage of pregnancy is not a healthy sign and needs attention. brown discharge is either a stale blood collected in the uterine cavity which is now coming out, or it could be a necrotic tissue (which usually is from the non-viable baby). with such a brown discharge, you have to find out about the viability of the baby. pregnancy test may not be helpful since it takes more than a week for the pregnancy test to become negative after the baby has become non-viable. this is not a fresh bleeding and hence unlikely to be due to lifting of your daughter. the best option for you would be to get ultrasonography done. it will inform whether the baby is viable or not. if the baby is non-viable, you will have to get the pregnancy terminated asap to prevent further complications like bleeding, infection, etc. please report to your obstetrician asap. i hope this helps you."

(we call this osmosis phenomenon). for this effect, we need to check the blood sugar at midnight around 2am or so. if this midnight glucose level is very low, then we have to decrease your night insulin levels. therefore, the best for you is to go immediately to your treating doctor and adjust the insulin dose you are taking. regards"

"a am not sure if a injured my hand at some point or if something is going on with it , because it was extremely sensitive on the outside of the pinky finger and would hurt if someone would shake my hand . now , it is not as sensitive , but a can still feel a burning sensation ( painful ) occasionally",1,111950,"hi, in my opinion that could be only over stress of muscles that is cured by relaxation, muscle relaxants, and physiotherapy. but if it is dupuytren contracture, it typically progresses slowly, over years. the condition usually begins as a thickening of the skin on the palm of your hand. as it progresses, the skin on your palm might appear puckered or dimpled. a firm lump of tissue can form on your palm. this lump might be sensitive to the touch but usually isn't painful. in later stages of dupuytrens contracture, cords of tissue form under the skin on your palm and can extend up to your fingers. as these cords tighten, your fingers might be pulled toward your palm, sometimes severely. the ring finger and pinky are most commonly affected, though the middle finger also can be involved. only rarely are the thumb and index finger affected. dupuytrens contracture can occur in both hands, though one hand is usually affected more severely. the main or exact cause are still under researches till now. so i would recommend relaxing your chat doctor. that would be the best choice for you. hope the above information helps. any further clarifications feel free to ask."

(it stops hepatitis c from spreading inside the body)the duration of the recommended course will depend on which genotype of the hepatitis c virus she is having. for genotype 1, a 48-week course is recommended. for all other genotypes, a course of 24 weeks will be recommended. a blood test is done at 4th and 12th weeks to check the response to treatment. if the test shows that the medications are having little effect in removing the virus, it may be recommended that treatment is stopped as further treatment may be of little use. hope the suggestion given above could be useful in getting her treatment."

"a a 19 and a had a kidney stone that blocked my kidney and caused pyelonephritis and then lead to sepsis , which almost killed me . would the kidney stone that blocked one of my kidneys have caused the cortical thinning of both of my kidneys ?",3,90580,"hi, thank you for your query. i can understand your concerns. renal atrophy with cortical thinning essentially means the shrinking of the kidney. the kidney is basically getting smaller because the cortical nephrons (on the outside of the kidney) is thinning out. cortical thinning eventually leads to renal failure. you have also multiple small cysts in both the kidneys. autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ad pkd)usually gives rise to large kidney. the presence of two or more cysts in each kidney is associated with a sensitivity and specificity of 90% and 100%, respectively. to differentiate it from benign cysts, you may undergo mutational screening for adpkd-1 and adpkd-2. treatment is conservative(medicinal) and eventual renal replacement therapy (dialysis) as the need arises. regards"

"a have had some anatomy/physiology . a have been experiencing some pain in my right thigh in the area of what a believe is the adducts longs muscle . when a sit down , the pain recedes as if to open up and pinched nerve ( ? ) . of a stand or walk for a few minutes , the pain returns . a thought it could be the sartorius muscle but a don to think so . would it be varicose veins ? would it be something involving the sacroiliac nerve ? a have had a diagnostic test to see how the circulation is in the area , results negative . any clues ?",1,56450,"hello, sorry to hear that our team in the medical was not able to help you out. it would have been perfect if you had mentioned the details of the mri reports as we could have understood something from it. if you have any issue with the intervertebral disc and nerve entrapment. now since you are mentioning pain in the hip, thigh, leg and back, i would like to know if the pain symptom is radiating in nature? also, how is the back pain? is the nature of the pain sharp shooting or dull aching. if dull aching then it will be related to muscle but if sharpshooting than it will be for nerve. now coming to an analysis of you, you mentioned your age is 38, so we can look for some degenerative changes in the lumbar spine. due to which there might be changes of back pain and nerve getting trapped. for this i will recommend you to try out the exercise for the core, back and lower limbs on both sides. it is mandatory to do exercise in any back pains or radiating pains as due to pain there is a muscle weakness which gets build up over a period of time and once the muscles are weak there is instability of the spinal column. i wish you check for your blood glucose levels along with uric acid too, so we can have a differential diagnosis made to rule out the possibility because. if you can still mention in detail about the mri it will be really kind of you. in my clinical practice of over 12 years, many back cases associated with leg pain are doing well with conservative management. like - exercise, physical therapy and yoga. outcome score is almost as desired to be. please start the exercise, and you will get a difference in the overall physical well-being. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further. take care jay in chat doctor."
"a have had some anatomy/physiology . a have been experiencing some pain in my right thigh in the area of what a believe is the adducts longs muscle . when a sit down , the pain recedes as if to open up and pinched nerve ( ? ) . of a stand or walk for a few minutes , the pain returns . a thought it could be the sartorius muscle but a don to think so . would it be varicose veins ? would it be something involving the sacroiliac nerve ? a have had a diagnostic test to see how the circulation is in the area , results negative . any clues ?",2,57758,"hi, in your case, there are few information that would be very helpful for me (if you have provided): - do you have a low back pain (i assume not)- do you have a paresthesia in the legs or feet-did you have a history of any trauma to low back or gluteal area?- did you have a history of any intramuscular injection before the symptoms?- for how long do you have these problems? please provide these answers to any doctor that you seek his/her advice in the future. overall, based on the provided information, a thigh pain referring to the bottom of the leg most commonly originates from a nerve, a muscle or joint. i summarize them here: 1- nerve: it is possible that you have a disk protrusion at a low back area. sometimes a protruded disk induces pressure to the adjacent nerve and causes thigh pain. in some cases there is no low back pain. also, if the sciatic nerve is irritated by any cause, it causes the same problem (this is a rare cause).2- muscle: a tight muscle area (trigger point) in some gluteal and thigh areas can cause posterior thigh pain with radiation to the leg. 3- joint: there are small joints above and below any vertebral bone. we call them facet joint. if the facet joint of the l5 vertebra (the fifth vertebra) is irritated or damaged by any cause, it can cause thigh pain, which is sometimes not accompanied by a low back pain. in conclusion, if your problem is for only a few days you can take a 3-5 day course of an anti-inflammatory medication (such as ibuprofen, diclofenac, ...) and an anti-spasm medication (such as baclofen), (certainly if you don't have any contraindication to use them. if you have the problem for more than 2 weeks you should be visited by a physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist, orthopedist, or rheumatologist for a more accurate diagnosis. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

my father is 87 and has congestive heart failure disease . be also has copy and had a stroke in 2001 and was diagnosed with prostrate cancer 4 years ago which was treated with radiation treatment . an you tell me how many years he may have left in his life considering all of his current health issues .,1,90747,"hi, thanks for writing in. many people end up with a second cancer with a history of having been treated for an earlier cancer with radiation therapy. however, at that time, providing radiation therapy had more benefits and risks and has helped in treating the testicular cancer and your husband has been free from symptoms almost 25 years. plasma cell dysplasia can be seen in such patients but saying with confirmation that it is indeed the radiation that is responsible is difficult. radiation effects are both dose dependent and non dose dependent. if your husband was exposed to radiation in error at his workplace then things would have been different but in the present case he has been given radiation therapy as a treatment and that has been successful to a certain extent. there are also patients who develop a second cancer that is unrelated to the first cancer. to know the chances of the prior radiation treatment causing the plasma cell dysplasia, all his medical records have to be verified and that will only give a risk. it cannot be said with certainty that the radiation given 25 years back is completely responsible for his present health condition."

a couple weeks ago a had forgotten to take my birth control pills for 4 days . a herd that after 2 days you should not finish the pack and just wait until that pack would have been completed to start a new one . when a forgot to take my pills i started my period that week . it has been about 2 weeks since then . be original pack would have ended today and a would have started a new one tomorrow . should a go ahead and start a new one tomorrow or should a wait until after a have my next period and start the new pack the day i finish ?,1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"i doctors , last week a noticed a slight pain in my left testicle- top part- a day after a sexual encounter where there was no oral sex only masturbation with another person .. a thought a caught an std and thought it would swell but it never did . the strange thing is the discomfort disappeared with more intake of water- know strange . the strange thing is my ejaculation have not been the same since . a have masturbated 3 times this week and noticed a significant change . a am a major shooter with lots of semen and now it is the complete opposite , more like a big squirt . a have no idea in the cause for this drastic change but my libido has decreased because of it . the sensation and excitement is not the same . a was wondering if perhaps the cause for this change was an std or a clogged vein.thanks",1,82366,"hello friend, thank you for posting your query through chat doctor. i am a homeopath answering your query and the answer which i am going to give you may contain several thoughts which may appear strange or new for you. this i say because homeopathy is a new system of medicine and is almost unheard by the majority of the population. therefore, due to the high influence of the conventional medicine the people at large are brainwashed to believe and act according to the health education given by them. coming back to the fibroadenoma of your left breast in the year 1979, you had a psychological conflict in the mind level. you are a sensitive individual and that is why your left breast was affected. it must have been related with your child chat doctor. the sensitivity is genetic, and you reacted to the conflict through the brain according to a genetic programming. mind-brain - organ affection resulted in the development of a lump in your left breast in 1979. you consulted your gynecologist, and he suggested that it may turn to become cancerous in future and so it is better to remove it, and you subdued to his suggestion. actually the lump in the breast was an attempt of the body to cure you, or it was the result of a self defense mechanism. since you had not resolved the conflict in the psychological level, the lump remained there without getting resolved. but the body kept the lump protected in a cyst with minimum amount of inflammation called chronic cystitis. by removing the fibroadenoma or chronic cystic mastitis, you were not cured, but your lump in the breast was removed. in 1995 also you are the same person, you are the same sensitive person, and you underwent another more serious psychological conflict and the same left breast was again affected in a more serious manner. instead of recognizing the mass as a defense mechanism, you got the fear in you that you have cancer. the tissue changes also suggested that there is more serious pathology, and they labelled your lump this time as cancer and suggested removal of your left breast. if you could have recognized the lump as a defense mechanism and if you had no fear of cancer, you could have retained your breast. but the fear of cancer is such that it is associated with death and so you lost your breast. in no case, either by removal of lump in 1979 or by removal of your breast in 1995, you are not cured only your disease is cured. hope by this time you have got the answer for your query. both are related to each other because they are in the same individual, same sensitivity, same program. homeopathy cures the person and once the individual is cured all his diseases will be cured. with best wishes,"
