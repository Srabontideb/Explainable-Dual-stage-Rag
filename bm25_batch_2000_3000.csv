"i there , now long do you have to be taking friday contraceptive pill to be protected if you done start taking it the first day of your period initially . a started taking it at another time in the month but took it for 7 days straight before a had unprotected sex , am a covered ? regards , laura",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"a have a friend who is having a lot of health problems . the experiences stomach cramps , abdomen pain , and shivers . right now , shes sitting in a bed , unable to move . the has been to doctors before about it but they all said it was stress . a think its something more . that do you think ?",2,105496,"his am chat doctor. i have read your message. i think i can help you. first, i do not think that your prior stroke is involved. what you have described is a type of aphasia neurologically speaking. and aphasia is usually caused by a left sided brain problem-not right like you state in your query. second, if it was truly due to the stroke, the problem would have been since 2009. brain problems in stroke don't get delayed. so, i don't think that your prior stroke has anything to do with the issue. second, the main causes of aphasia are stroke and dementia. it is not a stroke as per prior ct scan, and not dementia-dementia is memory loss, and from the query, your memory is pretty good-you remember the year 2009 clearly (suggests long term memory is good), and you remember the medicines (suggests short term memory is good as well). so like your doctors, i don't think its dementia either. however, i disagree with the choice of investigations- the ct has clearly missed your pre-existing stroke as well. so i cannot be sure whether it has missed a newer stroke as well. so, i would have ideally suggested another mri brain (a more sensitive study than cat scan) and a cv doppler. however, i still don't think it is a stroke. a stroke starts suddenly. and you have definitely not said that there was a sudden onset of symptoms. if however you have forgotten to mention this in the query, you should definitely think about stroke and plan an mri and cv doppler as suggested before. third, a significant history that you have given is the loss of work and lack of hobbies and physical exercises. i won't call it depression or anxiety. and therefore i don't think your medicines will work either. in your case, the age-old adage-all work and no play makes jack a dull boy-is probably most appropriate. so my suggestion is that you need to stop smoking and get some company and daily activities. it may sound odd to you, but inactivity does take its toll. i don't think medicines are needed in your case. you just need to fill in your time with more activities so that your mind is active again. i have tried to make it as simple as possible for you to understand. feel free to ask another query with a specific doubt based on the information i have given you. i would be happy to help you further. best of luck,"

"hi i would like to ask what are my chances that i could be pregnant i had closed 25mg for 3 days last april 16 but didst work and my fertility doc ask me to take another cycle started 6 may til 10 may .. then i had blood test 13 may tested i ovulated over the weekend.we had sex 8 of may and 10,11 of may . what are my chances ? thanks",1,33341,"hi, if you came to my clinic with those complaints i would ask you to stop worrying. many women that start using the pills for the first time experience similar problems. i understand that you have taken the inactive pills first and then started on the active pills. also, you have had intercourse only after your period was over that is about 11 days ago. the chances of pregnancy occurring after a single act of unprotected sexual intercourse are only 4%. also, for women that have regular periods the chance of getting pregnant is more if intercourse occurs after 11-12 days since the first day of the period. hence, the chances of getting pregnant are low if you have had contact before this period. you are also having a sick feeling in the stomach and most probably a cramp like feeling. this may be due to the pills as some females take time to get adjusted and may improve with continuous use and by taking the pills with food. the pills are not known to cause any major effect on the baby if they are inadvertently taken in early pregnancy. since you have started taking the active pills late, i would recommend that you use a backup contraceptive measure like condoms, for the next 7 days while you still take the pills to avoid pregnancy. i would be pleased to answer any further queries that you may have, enjoy a wonderful day."

"a am a heart transplant patient ( 8 yrs ) . a thought a had a heart attack about a month ago , called the paramedics , went to of , spent overnight in hospital . a had 5 before transplant and this seemed very much like the previous ones except the paramedics gave me 4 aspirins in transit . however , since there was no significant change in cardiac enzymes , they said no . a am still very weak , feel fatigued , and it changed my vision to the point of needing new glasses . that should a do ?",1,14530,i am not able to understand how paramedics could've shown you a ct scan of his head after he had fallen. was that a ct scan that had already been done which your father just happened to show the paramedics because they certainly couldn gotten one on site. i would say that the hospital and doctors there who repeated the studies and got even an mri which is highly sensitive for mass lesions are correct when they say there is no mass. i would have to say that the paramedics' interpretation was wrong. that's why paramedics should refrain from doing things they are not trained to do.

"my daughter is 3 and a noticed today that the toenail on each of her big toes is not connected at base of her toe anymore . to blood or anything , but it is very obviously not connected at the cuticle/base of her toe . that causes this ? that do a need to do for her ? will it reattach ?",1,35534,"i read your question carefully, and i understand your concern. actually, i need more information regarding your problem, for example how many days have passed since your big toe trauma, is there a blue/black discoloration of the toe, have you noticed any pus around or beneath the toenail, is your big toe all red and warm? i will try to include all possible options. since it's a trauma, i don't think that you have an ingrown toenail (fungus incarnates). the pain you have is due to trauma of the toenail itself and the surrounding tissue by the toenail. you can take over the counter painkillers but i don't think it will help too much. in order to get the best management you can consult your primary doctor, so he/she can see objectively your issue, since the treatments include from simple local wound care to removal (partial or total) of your toenail, antibiotics and regular local wound chat doctor. your doctor also have to visit you objectively, to rule out also a possible bone trauma of your big toe (but in the way you describe the trauma, i don't think that's your situation)i'm at your disposal if you have additional questions. i hope my answer helped. wishing you a good health if you can, in order for me to give you the best advice, is to send me a picture of your traumatized toe."

hello a was told a had planter fascia over 18 months ago then assumed that a heal spur was causing the pain . sometimes the pain in my heal is excruciating when a stand from rest or as my shift progresses ( a work in disabilities ) most severe pain is in my right foot a also for over twelve months have pain in the left of my neck that has waves of severity rays show nothing on the neck,1,93623,"brief answer:planter fasciitis needing pain medications and steroid shot. detailed answer:hello, based on what you told about your husband, it can be said with fair certainty that you husband is suffering from planter fasciitis. plantar fasciitis mainly results in pain in the heel and bottom of the foot and is seen often in clinical setup. the pain is usually most severe with the first steps of the day or following a period of rest. improvement of pain is usually seen with continued walking. the condition usually builds up slowly and cause intense pain. your husband is most likely doing a job which require long periods of standing, and he may also be obese. if i were your husbands doctor, i would first do an x-ray foot which usually show a heel spur, although an absence of spur does not rule out fasciitis. an ultrasound heel also aids in making diagnosis. i usually advise the best rest to patient to see whether the condition improves. along with rest, painkiller like:diclofenac k 50 mg twice daily is advised to aid with bed rest. if this is not sufficient, a steroid injection is advised which is injected at the site of maximal pain on heel. most of the patients improved in clinical setting after this remedy. surgery is considered only after conservative treatment has failed to resolve the issue after six months and has rarely been needed. i shall be happy to assist you if you need further help. wishing a safe and swift recovery for your husband"

by daughter is nine and she has quite a fatty mons pubis which she says is quite painful in particular the mornings . it has always been quite large for her age but has steadily gotten bigger . that do you think may be causing the appearance and the pain ?,1,18859,"hi. thanks for your query. read the history about your daughter and understood the problems. the history is quite unique. she gets the pains in the abdomen only if she sleeps on her tummy, feels sick, dizzy, and has headache too. she finds the way in the night to sleep on tummy whatever way you try to make her sleep on her sides or so. furthermore, she is fine if she is not sleeping n her tummy. with careful study of the history you have provided as above and also of the treatment for acid reflux my thoughts are as follows:-it is difficult to get acid reflux in such a small age unless there is some intra-abdominal problems.-since the pain comes only if she is sleeping on her tummy, means she has some inflammatory process in the abdomen that touches the very sensitive peritoneum in this particular position. i would suggest her the following:-first clinical evaluation and actual physical examination by a general or pediatric surgeon.-ct scan abdomen will be of tremendous help to confirm or rule out appendicitis/ nickels diverticulitis, internal hernia and so on. -routine investigations of the blood, urine and stool. once the investigations are done, start the following treatment:-a 5-day course of an antibiotic, metronidazole and probiotic. - medicines against intestinal worms.-diet changes if a particular food or beverage has been causing or increasing the problems."

"by elderly mother complains that her chest and arms hurts when she urinates . the pain shoots down to her hands and stops when she is through urinating . would this be a symptom of something else ? the says she has a kidney infection but a wonder if she means bladder infection . although , she says it does not hurt when she pees .",1,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"hello , a started my period on june 4th and ended on the 8th and a had sex with one guy that night . in the 11th of june a had sex with another guy but he put on a condom 5 minutes after we started to keep from nutting inside of me . a had sex with the first guy again on june 15th . a later had sex with the same guy that whole next week . a missed my period for july & when a took a pregnancy test on july 6th a was pregnant . a went to the doctor and they said a was approximately 8 weeks pregnant . by due date was march 7th 2015 but when a went to get an ultrasound on august 11th my doctor told me my due date was now march 11th 2015 and a conceived between june 13-15th . to who is the father ? a believe a got pregnant on july 18th because of my first due date on march 11th . a just think my baby is growing fast so therefore the crl measurements of my baby made the doctor change my due date to march 7th .",1,2330,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. unfortunately, ultrasound findings of the dating the pregnancy can be off for up to five days. so the changing of your due date by four days does not really change the possibility of your first partner having been the father of your baby. furthermore, sperm can remain alive in your genital tract for up to five days, and once you ovulate, the egg remains alive inside you for up to 72 hours. this is the reason that no test can accurately assess the date of conception based on the exact dates that you had intercourse. women typically ovulate two weeks before their period arrives. if you have a 28-day cycle, and your last period started on june 4, you likely ovulated around june 18. so either of the men you had sex with between the 15th and approximately the 20th could be the father of your baby. i hope that this information was helpful to you and that i was able to adequately answer your question even though it is not possible with medical science to determine the paternity of your pregnancy. i wish you the best of luck with your pregnancy and good health. best wishes,"

( a do intake onions regularly but even when a done & then ejaculate the color is yellow or pale ) 4 . main slight heavy feeling in testes while sitting its been few yrs now and the above 3 still exist . a have met many urologists .. all acknowledge but say it is fine . 3 days back a ejaculated in bed ( wet dream ) but a found it was somewhat painful . yesterday a had oral sex and again a found ejaculation a bit painful . please advise if there is anything serious ? also plus advise if there is a test a could do to check testosterone level .,1,82366,"hello friend, thank you for posting your query through chat doctor. i am a homeopath answering your query and the answer which i am going to give you may contain several thoughts which may appear strange or new for you. this i say because homeopathy is a new system of medicine and is almost unheard by the majority of the population. therefore, due to the high influence of the conventional medicine the people at large are brainwashed to believe and act according to the health education given by them. coming back to the fibroadenoma of your left breast in the year 1979, you had a psychological conflict in the mind level. you are a sensitive individual and that is why your left breast was affected. it must have been related with your child chat doctor. the sensitivity is genetic, and you reacted to the conflict through the brain according to a genetic programming. mind-brain - organ affection resulted in the development of a lump in your left breast in 1979. you consulted your gynecologist, and he suggested that it may turn to become cancerous in future and so it is better to remove it, and you subdued to his suggestion. actually the lump in the breast was an attempt of the body to cure you, or it was the result of a self defense mechanism. since you had not resolved the conflict in the psychological level, the lump remained there without getting resolved. but the body kept the lump protected in a cyst with minimum amount of inflammation called chronic cystitis. by removing the fibroadenoma or chronic cystic mastitis, you were not cured, but your lump in the breast was removed. in 1995 also you are the same person, you are the same sensitive person, and you underwent another more serious psychological conflict and the same left breast was again affected in a more serious manner. instead of recognizing the mass as a defense mechanism, you got the fear in you that you have cancer. the tissue changes also suggested that there is more serious pathology, and they labelled your lump this time as cancer and suggested removal of your left breast. if you could have recognized the lump as a defense mechanism and if you had no fear of cancer, you could have retained your breast. but the fear of cancer is such that it is associated with death and so you lost your breast. in no case, either by removal of lump in 1979 or by removal of your breast in 1995, you are not cured only your disease is cured. hope by this time you have got the answer for your query. both are related to each other because they are in the same individual, same sensitivity, same program. homeopathy cures the person and once the individual is cured all his diseases will be cured. with best wishes,"

"hello . a am 30 , and a had a mammogram and ultra sound today as a follow up-to a biopsy 6 months ago . everything is fine , but my question is whether a should wait until next moth to try to get pregnant . would the radiation affect the baby if a do get pregnant ?",1,69429,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. any activity you do that does not hurt you physically will not affect your ability to conceive nor will harm you if you are pregnant. so you can ride the roller coaster, run, or do any of the activities you usually do to enjoy life and stay healthy, and it will not harm you or interfere with your fertility. the one thing that you may want to consider is that your uterus needs time to heal from a cesarean section, and it is generally recommended you wait one year to become pregnant again to allow the uterine scar to regain full strength. women who get pregnant sooner after having a c-section are at increased risk of abnormal attachment of the placenta, and of rupturing their uterus if they go into labor. i am sure after your last delivery you want to try to conceive right away, but the safest thing would be to wait until a full year passed since your c/section. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful to you. best wishes for your next pregnancy,"

pm 23 and in on sprinter on my first pack but a had 3 pills left b4 finishing the pack when a had unprotected sex .. am a of .. how long till a should have waited,2,109368,"hello. whether you need backup birth control after missing a birth control pill depends on where you were in your pack when you missed the pill. for combination bcp's like tri-sprintec, if you miss one of the first two pills in the pack, you should take the forgotten pill as soon as you remember and the next at its usual time (just like you did). you should then use a backup method of birth control (e.g., condoms) for one week. if you missed a pill from day 3 through 21 of your pack, you should take the forgotten pill as soon as you remember it and the next at its usual time (as above). backup birth control is not required in this case. if you missed one of the inactive pills (the white ones), you don't need to take the forgotten pill, and no backup birth control is needed.""b""given those scenarios, you can decide whether you need emergency contraception. specifically, if you missed one of the first two pills of your pack and had unprotected sex within a week, you should take emergency contraception. otherwise, emergency contraception isn't indicated. i hope that answers your question!"
pm 23 and in on sprinter on my first pack but a had 3 pills left b4 finishing the pack when a had unprotected sex .. am a of .. how long till a should have waited,3,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

a have a bump on the back of my leg . on my thigh . and in not sure if its ring worm or a bug bite ? by boyfriend right now has ring worm and its not covered up and i think i go it from him but in not sure . could you help me too try to see what it is . thank you .,1,95340,"hi, i understand your concern and your problem. this may happen in the following scenarios. 1. the nova ring is broken; sometimes the joint of the ring is broken, so it may not regain back its desired shape once inside the vagina and slips out. in this case try a new ring.2. the vagina is lax and roomy. sometimes vaginal laxity may interfere with holding the ring in place, this is very rare and unless the vagina is too lax, it does not slip.3. ring not pushed far enough; sometimes women do not push it far enough inside so that it remains at the vaginal opening and slips out. the first and third are common likely causes. check to see if any of this is happening to you. if the ring is broken use a new one and use some other method like condom for next 7 days. if you are scared to push it in, i want to reassure you that don't be afraid. this ring is safe and will not go anywhere other than the vagina. it does not cause any trauma, so it is safe. just push it way inside, so it will not slip. the best position to do this is lying down and slowly pushing it inside towards your buttocks that is backwards. a tilted uterus will not affect the position of the ring and neither will it have any effect on its insertion. another word of caution is that if the ring has been lying outside for more than 3 hours, use another method like condom for the next seven days after correctly inserting the ring. hope i was able to help you, thank you for using chat doctor and have a nice day."

"my husband is 43 yrs old , and was born with one fully functioning kidney and a non functioning kidney . be had a stint put in 13 years ago , due to the ureter closing off . the stint was removed a few weeks later . be has had no problems since . now , he is having a lot of pain in the right flank area . it is painful to the touch . be keeps insisting it in to his kidney because the pain is not the same . be is a stubborn man ... any advice ?",1,103481,hellothanks for query. your husband has undergone surgery (probably for stone in his ureter) and a d. j stent has been put in his ureter. it is common to get pain in kidney area as the urine flows backwards through stent in to kidney causing pain in kidney area while urinating. since the stent has to be in the ureter for 2 weeks the patient can not be put on per urethral catheter to chat doctor. the catheter in urethra is more cumbersome than pain due to having stent in ureter. normally this gets resolved within a week till then take painkillers and antibiotics.

a was playing tennis and severely pulled my hamstring . 2 days later my whole thy was purple . by concern is the bruising has moved down to my calf then it was sore and now to my ankle and achilles and now they are sore . is it normal for the blood to travel down like that ?,1,82669,"an infection in the bone and in foreign material in the bone is very serious. such infections can continue for months and cause damage to the bone and surrounding tissue. the foreign materials could break down and cause pain and other problems. the infection can go into the blood and cause sepsis. this is life-threatening. antibiotics should be started now and probably continued for several weeks if not months. it is possible he has had this infection cooking along in the bone for some time, and it is now just coming to the surface. this means it is now about to spread very quickly. this happened to my brother. his hip replacement became infected but didn't show any outside signs until he went into shock and was taken to hospital by ambulance. he was lucky to survive. keep trying to convince your friend to see the doctor. he will eventually end up there anyway and in much more serious condition if he waits. hope this helps."

"be have a soon to be one year old who cries when she makes a bowel movement ... it is obvious that she is in a lot of pain .... after the by , she is fine .... it is usually solid with a little blood .... we have asked the paediatrician and he said just give her more water , and veggies ... that we do , but now trying to find a specialist for castro ..",1,33660,"hi there, the backed up stool and tendency to urinary tract infection does point to the idea that she could be constipated, despite being regular. regarding the frequency of bowel movements, do note that different people tend to have different bowel needs, up to 3 times a day is accepted as normal. so she could actually be going daily and still be relatively constipated. what we are aiming for is the right consistency of stools, which is long and sausage-like, with or without cracks. if you need more visual guidance, look for the bristol stool chart online, and aim for type 3 or 4. it is good that she is taking enough fibers, but also pay attention to her habits and stress to her that she needs to go when she feels like it even if it is more than once a day. constipation often occurs at this age because this is when they are getting better at holding it in, and prefer other exciting activities to sitting in the toilet. the other rarer possibility would be that she has a mild form of hirschsprungs disease, which means that some nerves are missing from the end of the colon, making the evacuating of stool difficult. most people have this diagnosed as babies, but if its very mild it can be missed. it might be more likely if she had delayed bowel movement more than a day after birth, or had tendency to constipation even as a baby. you will have to discuss with your doctor on this possibility, because confirmation would be needed with a rectal biopsy. hope this helps, and all the best to you."

"hi in experiencing serious stomach pains and my breasts are leaking a large amount of milk and my twin boys are now four years old and quite sure in not pregnant as i have had a period recently and have just done a negative pregnancy test . in really starting to worry . i have a cyst on my ovaries which i was diagnosed with in september last year , please help .",1,52955,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. in the first trimester of pregnancy, your ovaries produce the hormone progesterone which normally is made by the placenta once it reaches adequate size. so it is not unusual in the first trimester pregnancy to feel pain in your ovaries. in addition, as your uterus stretches, you also may experience some cramping and pulling sensations, which can be on the sides. the only thing that is concerning is if you have not had an ultrasound this pregnancy to confirm that it is normal and located in your uterus. if you already have had an ultrasound for this pregnancy it is unlikely that there could be anything harmful going on, especially if you are not bleeding. so if the pain is severe enough that you cannot function, especially if you have not yet had an ultrasound, if you cannot reach her doctor within a reasonable amount of time, you may want to pursue care in an emergency setting. if you have had a normal ultrasound earlier in this pregnancy, you really do not need to worry, as your ovaries are normally examined as part of your pregnancy ultrasound and a large cyst would've already been detected. tylenol, or acetaminophen is safe to use for pain at the normal adult dosage during all trimesters of pregnancy, and you can try to see if that helps with the pain. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

"hello , or . a am 26 year old , i have a kidney infection for the past 1year i did scanning and x-ray thy said its pyelonephritis , but last week i did of scan a result is both kidneys are normal in size and shape but a mild prominent extralegal pelvis seen on the right . els dr. that does it mean ? it a curable with antibiotics does it affect a kidney ? . a have abdominal , fever pain plus what is a solution and also what a a antibiotics ? may god bless a .",1,34445,"hi, thanks for writing in. the collecting system of the kidney is made of renal calyxes and pelvis. this collects the urine formed in kidney and transports it through the ureter (tubes connecting kidneys and urinary bladder) to the urinary bladder. the pelvicalyceal system is the mouth of the kidney where it connects with the upper end of the ureter. i guess that you have got ultrasound scan done, and it shows mild fullness of the pelvicalyceal system in the left kidney, that is a term applied to increase in diameter of the collecting system in your left kidney. it is not a critical situation, and please do not worry if you do not have any urinary symptoms. since it is mentioned as mild fullness and no kidney stones have been found, therefore(i) it can be that your bladder was completely full at the of ultrasound scan(ii) your kidney pelvicalyceal system is appearing full by itself (extrarenal pelvis) and is an extension of normal appearance.(iii) rarely an infection of urinary system and kidneys (recent or old) can cause such a finding, but this is likely only if you have symptoms like pain in the region of kidney and problems like burning urination or discoloration of urine or any kidney infections in the past.(iv) stones in kidney or ureter can also cause fullness of pelvicalyceal system and since you do not have any stone therefore this does not apply to you. it is important to know if your scan was repeated after passing urine and still there was persistent mild fullness of the pelvicalyceal system on left side. this can also be confirmed by doing an mvp which is injecting a contrast and taking 5 to 6 x-rays to study the functioning of the kidneys in a better way. please consult the urologist."

"a woke up this morning with a big lump in my right breast . the lump is as big as a golf ball . it is painful . a had this happened before about a year ago , the lump was in my left breast then and it was way bigger . a figured it was exposure to mold . you see , we rented a home in missouri and they did not have a good air circulation . is a matter of fact no windows in the bathroom and the exhaust fan was not working . after each shower , the carpet will feel damp . new days later , a smell of mold ( spores ) became very strong . that a when the lump appeared . after we vacated the house , few days later the lump subsided and never returned . will this be the same phenomenon ? a am 49 years old , all my mammograms have been normal.mary or should a see the doctor now ?",1,82366,"hello friend, thank you for posting your query through chat doctor. i am a homeopath answering your query and the answer which i am going to give you may contain several thoughts which may appear strange or new for you. this i say because homeopathy is a new system of medicine and is almost unheard by the majority of the population. therefore, due to the high influence of the conventional medicine the people at large are brainwashed to believe and act according to the health education given by them. coming back to the fibroadenoma of your left breast in the year 1979, you had a psychological conflict in the mind level. you are a sensitive individual and that is why your left breast was affected. it must have been related with your child chat doctor. the sensitivity is genetic, and you reacted to the conflict through the brain according to a genetic programming. mind-brain - organ affection resulted in the development of a lump in your left breast in 1979. you consulted your gynecologist, and he suggested that it may turn to become cancerous in future and so it is better to remove it, and you subdued to his suggestion. actually the lump in the breast was an attempt of the body to cure you, or it was the result of a self defense mechanism. since you had not resolved the conflict in the psychological level, the lump remained there without getting resolved. but the body kept the lump protected in a cyst with minimum amount of inflammation called chronic cystitis. by removing the fibroadenoma or chronic cystic mastitis, you were not cured, but your lump in the breast was removed. in 1995 also you are the same person, you are the same sensitive person, and you underwent another more serious psychological conflict and the same left breast was again affected in a more serious manner. instead of recognizing the mass as a defense mechanism, you got the fear in you that you have cancer. the tissue changes also suggested that there is more serious pathology, and they labelled your lump this time as cancer and suggested removal of your left breast. if you could have recognized the lump as a defense mechanism and if you had no fear of cancer, you could have retained your breast. but the fear of cancer is such that it is associated with death and so you lost your breast. in no case, either by removal of lump in 1979 or by removal of your breast in 1995, you are not cured only your disease is cured. hope by this time you have got the answer for your query. both are related to each other because they are in the same individual, same sensitivity, same program. homeopathy cures the person and once the individual is cured all his diseases will be cured. with best wishes,"

i took an answer pregnancy test and 1 bold purple line showed up on the right side . an a be pregnant ? and also my atomic feels tight . pm dizzy all the time.i feel tired a get head aches all the time . ave been using the bathroom lot . that dose this mean,1,35396,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. if you have not yet missed your period, even if you are pregnant, the line will appear very faint on the pregnancy test as your hormone levels are extremely low at this time in pregnancy. so there is no reason to assume that the test was wrong as the greatest likelihood is that you are actually pregnant. however, women can have a situation where they have a positive pregnancy test and then get their normal period on time. this is known as a chemical pregnancy and is caused by the situation where the egg is fertilized but never implants into the uterus and continues to grow. so i encourage patients in general to try to avoid performing pregnancy test before they actually miss their period, as even though you have a positive pregnancy test this early, it does not guarantee that the pregnancy is going to take. if your cycle is late, there is no reason to assume that there is any problem with the pregnancy. if you do retest after you miss your period and the line is still very weekly positive, it may be reasonable to see a physician and get a blood test for the level of your pregnancy hormone. pregnancy hormone levels are supposed to double every 48 hours so by the time you miss your period the levels should be significantly high enough to produce a clear double line on the pregnancy test especially if you perform it with your first morning urine as recommended. low hormone levels in early pregnancy can indicate that the pregnancy is not developing properly or that it can be an ectopic or tubal pregnancy, which needs to be diagnosed and accurately managed by a physician. in the meantime however, i encourage you to stop chat doctor. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes and good luck with the pregnancy,"

"i ! my son was diagnose with lyme disease after going to many of and hospitals just sending him to psychiatrist and psychologist finally a of from the men clinic send for some test to be done and the final answer lyme disease be was on antibiotic for some time.now a think he is having some here reaction . any advice ? also why most of even infectious disease do not understand this disease when so many people are suffering , and there so few llmd in the usa and people have to travel to other countries to be treated.see when there is no answer we play psychology right ?",1,59679,"hello dear. lyme disease is related to painful rashes on armpit and thigh, but may not be related to brain scarring. lyme disease is usually curable with antibiotics. this is so true that some authors of lyme disease research have stated that the most common cause of lack of response of lyme disease to antibiotics is a lack of lyme disease to begin with! the type of antibiotic depends on the stage of the disease (early or late) and what areas of the body are affected. early illness is usually effectively treated with medications taken by mouth, for example, doxycycline (tobramycin), amoxicillin (mobil), or cefuroxime acetic (certain). these generally result in a rapid cure of lyme disease. therefore, if a person finds a typical bulls-eye skin rash (described above) developing in an area of a tick bite, they should seek medical attention as soon as possible. generally, antibiotic treatment resolves the rash within one or two weeks with no long-term consequences. later illness such as nervous-system disease might require intravenous chat doctor. there are no home remedies to treat lyme disease. in those people with two or more episodes of erythema migrant rash, even years apart, it is felt that the episodes represent different infections or reinfection rather than persistence of the original infection. for relief of lyme disease symptoms, pain-relieving medicines might be added. swollen joints can be reduced by the doctor removing fluid from them (arthrocentesis). an arthrocentesis is a procedure whereby fluid is removed from a joint using a needle and syringe under sterile conditions. it is usually performed in a doctor's office. rarely, even with appropriate antibiotics, the arthritis continues. it has been suggested by researchers that sometimes joint inflammation can persist even after eradication of the lyme bacteria. this complication has been explained as an ongoing autoimmune response causing inflammation of the joint that was initially stimulated by the original bacterial infection. oral medications such as ibuprofen (motrin, turin) can also be used to reduce inflammation and improve function. there is no evidence that nonspecific fatigue that persists after treatment for lyme disease is related to persistent infection. the risks of prolonged treatments with antibiotics are far greater than any benefit in this situation. of note, recent research was done to study whether longer-term antibiotic treatment of persistent symptoms of lyme disease led to any better outcomes than shorter-term treatment. the study found that longer-term antibiotic treatment did not have additional beneficial effects on health-related quality of life beyond those with shorter-term treatment. specifically, the researchers determined that this longer-term antibiotic treatment had no more beneficial effect on fatigue, or musculoskeletal, neuropsychological, or cognitive symptoms and disorders from lyme disease than placebo hope i have answered your question. feel free to contact me if you have any more questions. i'll be glad to help you. all the besting warm regards"

"a am on birth control and took one more active pill than a was suppose to last month , hoping to delay my period by a day . but my period never came . by next period is expected next week . a be been really nauseated , exhausted , cramping , spotted yesterday a little , been running a fever , and can only eat things that a am craving . is this due to messing up my schedule or could a be pregnant ?",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

the last three months a was doing iui treatment which a did 2 cycles but both were negative . in 2015 a did iui and first try came back positive . to my question is does my age and overweight have to do anything with not be able to get pregnant this time or do a need to take medication to balance out my hormonal ? right now my weight is 235 age 30 about to turn 31 . in 2015 a weight 215 and was 29 .,1,7012,"hello, and i hope i can help you todayunwanted 72, when taken correctly, reduces a women chance of pregnancy from an unprotected encounter to less than 10%. however, unfortunately that means that one in 10 women still can conceive even if they take the medication correctly. furthermore, in the cycle that she takes it the medication can delay or affect her cycle. so just to be safe, i would recommend that your girlfriend do a urine pregnancy test. it does not need to be done in the doctor's office you can purchase one over-the-counter. however, she did have a normal menstrual cycle since she took the unwanted, which is a good sign that she is not pregnant. women can have irregular menstrual cycles from hormonal changes due to stress, weight or schedule changes, and other medical hormonal problems. if her pregnancy test is negative, and your girlfriend is not menstruate for three months, she should see a gun doctor for an evaluation to figure out why. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"hi ... in married for 4 yrs , trying to conceive , doc advised ccq50 along with progynova 2mg and duphaston10mg . but i he found that progynova drugs have side effect to like breast cancer , it also suggests not to take them during pregnancy .... in confused , ply help .",1,73536,"hallow, ferry is camphene citrate. it is basically used for egg release (ovulation) where natural ovulation is a problem. it is in particular useful in polycystic ovarian syn chat doctor. camphene citrate is also having antioestrogenic effect. so it may hamper growth of endometrium. hence, in women where endometrial growth is low, gonadotropin hormones may be preferred for induction of ovulation. endometrial thickness between 9 mm to 13 mm has proved to be most conducive for implantation of fertilized ovum or blastocyst. ovulation occurring when endometrium is just 5.7 mm is likely to end in no pregnancy. so long as the follicular size is concerned, it has been reported for many decades that the ova discharged from the follicles of size between 18 mm to 21 mm are the healthiest one and give maximum fertilization rate and continuation of pregnancy success rate. progynova is a synthetic hormone replacement for estrogen. it is used to build up the lining of the uterus in preparation for embryo transfer during a thaw cycle for women who do not ovulate regularly. hence, in your case, it might prove to be effective in building up the endometrium. however, you should not wait for the ovulation beyond the follicular size more than 21 mm. if it takes longer for the endometrium to grow, you may waste this cycle and start progynova earlier in next cycle and have ovulation at proper follicular size. i hope this information is useful to you for further decisions."

i . a completed a pack of minigynon on saturday . event started a new one decided to let my period run its course . a just had unprotected sex with my boyfriend and he came in me . an i start a new pack of pill starting off with two and i wont get pregnant,1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"a went to the dentist yesterday and they told me a had an infection in my tooth , i was prescribed amnioxcillin and tylenol 3 its been one day , the pain hast gone away yet . by dentist said its the infection that causing the pain . and i should feel results within 48 hours . is this correct ?",1,96182,"swelling is another common problem after the extraction of wisdom tooth. rather the painful swelling is a good sign and is indicator of normal progress of healing process of wound. there is no fixed time frame for its duration and level of severity. these can be different from person to person. to reduce the amount of swelling one can do cold fermentation with ice. it should be done for 20 minutes and then take break of 20 minutes. do this for one hour within 12 hours of surgery. do not do hot fermentation. the post-operative instructions of the dentist explain all this including the start and reduction of swelling. normally it takes 7 days for swelling to subside and if this does not happen within this expected time then one should call up the dentist to checkup. in cases where swelling once goes away and then sets in again, this can be due to infection in the wound."

hi doc i had a miscarriage before 2 months i did a & a on 2 may then after 2 months of normal periods this time i was going for follicle study on 11th it was 8mm and it 13 and it mss then on 13th day i was sure that it must have ruptured as always happens but but doc said there is no growth but free fluid is seen so is there chances of pregnancy .. does it ruptured one day before what it means,1,54683,what was the size of the dominant follicle on day 10. were the two ultrasounds done by the same doctor? the fact that it was not seen on day 13 means that you have ovulated (the follicle must have ruptured). in all probability this is the reason. so don't worry. a small possibility is that the first ultrasound itself was wrong and that there was no dominant follicle in the first ultrasound. see your doctor and check for serum progesterone on day 20-21. the result will confirm whether ovulation has occurred. if you have any further concerns do write to me. i will be happy o answer.

"hello i want to ask you about connection between infection in a tooth and tonsillitis chronic . by dentist told me , that i have infection in my tooth , because she failed something and now i have tonsillitis chronic and nothing seems to help ( i had duracell , bioparox and now placid or ) thank you for your help . am going to see my dentist in 2 weeks .",1,22667,"dear patient, i can understand your concern and feel sorry for the pain you are suffering from. you are informing me that when you got the upper molar extracted, the dentist told you that the bone between the sinus and tooth is destroyed and sinus cavity is open. roots of upper molar often are found inside the maxillary sinus, which causes opening of the sinus cavity while extraction of the tooth, creating an oro-antral fistula, that is a direct connection between oral cavity and sinus cavity. in this case, the food or water you take has chances of passing infection in the sinus through mouth and the infection does not resolve. it is mandatory to close this connection between mouth and the sinus. it could be done by the dentist by taking stitches in the area when he found that sinus has opened, but it can also be done now. however, as about 2 weeks has passed since extraction, the opening would not be as much clear as it would have been during extraction. a blood clot may have filled the area. so what you need to do now is, go to an oral surgeon or an ent specialist. i know you have insurance problem, but there seems no other solution to your problem. you might have to go for x-rays and probably ct scan of the area to diagnose if oro-antral fistula actually exists and if it does, you might have to go for a little surgery to close the communication between mouth and sinus followed by antibiotics to resolve the infection. i hope this information helps. thank you for choosing chat doctor. i wish you get well soon. best,"

a accidentally hit my gum flap over my wisdom tooth with a sucker and then it cut it somehow it got infected and it hurts and everything hurts so bad a cant and swallow a cant do nothing till now it has spread into three or four different spots on my gums what are real red and white spots and its just so bad a done know what to do pm already taking antibiotics for my stitches in my hand but yet this wont go away,1,53390,hi. can understand your concern. as per your complaint the swollen gum and the white material inside it is a result of some inflammation. there can be a few reasons depending upon whether it is the second molar or the wisdom tooth. in case it is a wisdom tooth which is erupting or is impacted then the gum above it can get infected and inflamed due to either food deposition between the gum and the wisdom tooth or it can be due to gum flap bitten by the opposite jaw tooth and the condition is known as peritonitis. the white material in it is pus. in case it is second molar the swollen gum with white material in it can be as a result of infection in the gums due to deposits on the teeth like plaque or calculus or due to foreign body impaction in the gums which carries infection along with it deeper into the gums causing pus formation. it can also be due to deeply infected tooth causing pus formation below the tips of the roots of the tooth causing swelling on the gums with pus inside. i would suggest you to consult a dentist and get evaluated for the exact cause of the swelling and get treated accordingly. in case if it is wisdom tooth either excision of gum flap or extraction if the tooth is impacted followed by antibiotics and painkillers can be done. in case of gum infection professional cleaning of teeth followed by antibiotics and gum paints can help. in case of tooth infection root canal treatment or extraction depending on the condition of the tooth can be done. hope your query is solved. if you find the answer helpful please write a positive review and click on find this answer helpful as a token of appreciation. thanks and regards. chat doctor.

"i , i was recently in costa rich and drank bottled water . but during departure i drank water from fountain and once arriving in us , my whole body has been itching and tickling all over randomly first day i had stomach pain on left side , i felt constipated or bloated . a must also mention that on tip of my penis has some pain but i used protection when i had sex but did receive oral sex for less than a minute without condom .. could this be all by one thing or i am just overthinking ? thanks",1,2868,"see, itching and stomach pain and pain on tip of penis are totally unrelated symptoms. you may have itching because of some allergy as you visited a foreign place. and as far as stomach ache is concerned, you guessed it right, because of the fountain water. for stomach ache, you can take gastric antibiotics (like norfloxacin) and antispasmodics (like cyclops). and if itching is intense, you can take antihistamines (like cetirizine). and for pain in tip of penis, you should not take anything right now. if the problem persists, then you can consult your physician."

"hi , a am salsa . last 3 days ago a was going to my dr. before that a had of scan and the report is coming the report says a had brain cyst in the back side . but a have no pain at all , only when a laugh very loudly then a feel pain in the back and dr. said may be that is not harmful for me . .but when a heard that a have a cyst a am to much upset . now what can a do for myself ? what is good diet for me ? in future what happen to me ?",1,18983,"hi anita and thanks for the query. i am so sorry to hear about this cyst and the operation you underwent. i am however comforted that you have been feeling a lot better since the procedure except for minor headaches. this is normal and eve without head surgery, we all get headaches now and then. when a cyst is opened, it can be totally removed, if possible or not removed. when it cannot be removed, it is sufficiently destroyed to prevent future recollections. i am pretty convinced that this is what you was done in your case. though the chances are real that it can recur, but these are very small. i am confident you had the best possible procedure given the surrounding circumstances. there is no need in changing your diet or eating any specialized products. you may at will but not that they have any impact on the disease condition that you had. the decision is entirely yours to make. i hope that you find this helpful. i wish you well. feel free to ask for more information if need be. thanks."

"a have had a lump in on the right groin area and a am a female . ave had this for about 5 years and at first it want sensitive , but recently when i begin my menstrual cycle it surfaces and is about the size of a softball and is painful till a pass the cycle . that could it possibly be ?",1,25751,"hi, if the lump size is small (less than 1 to 1.5 cm), it could possibly be an abscess especially as it is present in the crease of buttock, a common area for infection. the area is wet commonly and in summer, the more and so infection is common. you must have had the same lesion, long time ago and if this does not rupture on its own, similar treatment might be necessary after 10 days. antibiotics will help in reducing the infection size and also stops it from further spreading. if it is paining, you can take a painkiller nsaids like diclofenac or diclofenac. i think it is nothing to be concerned about. take care. hope i was helpful. any further queries, happy to help."

i a am 21 years old and have been with my boyfriend for three years and this whole time a been trying to get pregnant we have inter course everyday with no protection and a done get my period every month what is a way to get pregnant ? please help thank a,1,108096,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. it is true that theoretically you should have been clear of the injection within three months of discontinuation, however many women after being a depo-provera for a long time do not resume having ovulatory, regular, menstrual cycles until 6 to 9 months or even up to a year after discontinuation. unfortunately, it is difficult to artificially induce ovulation in women who are coming off depo-provera. if you were not trying to become pregnant, your cycle could be regulated temporarily with birth control pills, but if you're actually trying to get pregnant the best thing you can do with this point is to just keep trying and wait and see. if you feel any symptoms of pregnancy, and you haven't gotten your period for a while, i would do pregnancy test just to make sure. there is always a possibility even if your periods are not regular that you do ovulate sometimes. so in summary, continue having unprotected sex every other to every three days and give it some more time. 80% of couples will conceive within one year, and if after a year of trying you and your partner are unsuccessful, it might be a good idea to see a fertility specialist for an evaluation. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes, and good luck getting pregnant,"

(we call this osmosis phenomenon). for this effect, we need to check the blood sugar at midnight around 2am or so. if this midnight glucose level is very low, then we have to decrease your night insulin levels. therefore, the best for you is to go immediately to your treating doctor and adjust the insulin dose you are taking. regards"

"the last couple of days a have had lower back pain and abdominal pain at the same time . it seems to be pushing against my bladder and making me use the bathroom more frequently . a have not done anything out of the ordinary , and i feel a like i can stretch the pain out of my back , but it is very sore by the top of my buttocks . doesthis sound serious ?",1,13846,"hello, with history, it does not sound to me that it is arthritis. so you can be relaxed for the same. now the cracking sound is actually the unlocking of the facet joints, which is once in while common for some. but if it is always associated with relief of back pain and neck pain than it's a muscle weakness of the spinal column and an exercise will be of good choice to work behind it. headache can be cervicogenic headache or due to stress as well. since you are 15 and having no major traumatic injuries i do not think you will have any major symptoms. but you can get your eye checked once if anything related to the same. of course sleep is a must to look for, because if you do not sleep well, the body will enter the fatigue state soon and may lead to muscle weakness leading to pain. at the age of 15 doing regular physical aerobic exercises are recommended. because lack of exercise can cause pain and aches, and at the age of 15 its is hardly acceptable that one will have headaches and back pains. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further. take care jay in chat doctor."

a work out on a daily basis but yesterday i was during sit-ups on my exercise ball . is soon as i went to lift up there was this stabbing pain in my chest . a can also feel it in my back adjacent to where the chest pain is . it hurts when i am trying to turn my neck as well .,1,41649,"hello. thank you for your question and welcome to chat doctor. i understand your concern. well, i am going to try and explain the differences between various origins of the pain which can arise from the rib cage. there is angina. it is described more like mid-chest heaviness or squeezing sensation, that is triggered by exercise and relieved by rest, which radiates to the both sides of the chest, to the jaw and left arm and shoulder. it is indicative of a blockage within one or more coronary arteries and reflects the lowering of blood supply to the heart muscle. an ekg obtained in the moment of chest pain, if it fills this description, would be helpful. then there is pleuritic chest pain. this kind of pain is sharp, stabbing pain that can happen in any part of the chest area. no radiation like in anginal pain. it arises from acute or chronic inflammation of the linings that are within the rib cage: pleura (lining of the lungs) or pericardium (lining of the heart) or both. in this regard, i would recommend a chest x-ray for pleural inflammation or effusion. in case of pericardial pain and anginal pain, echocardiogram is helpful, by evaluating the size, motility and function of heart muscle and valves, and also by assessing the pericardium and whether there is fluid build-up within it, or not. other causes of chest pain are related to the locomotion system of the rib cage: muscle soreness, bone and cartilage-related pain. in the end, stress can also cause chest pain. i hope i was helpful with my answer. best regards,"

"a had a tooth ache a few times for which a suspected a was grinding my teeth . while the area does not hurt , not sensitive to touch or hot/cold , a now have the sensation in my lower right cheek adjacent to that tooth that appears may be slightly swollen , but the sensation is that of wearing off novocaine .",1,20517,root canal done tooth can never give and sensation to cold or hot. moreover the pain and pressure felt on tilting the head clearly indicates that the pain is due to irreversible pulpits and a root canal treated tooth does not have pulp in it. so my friend the pain you are feeling is due to the tooth adjacent to the one which already s been root treated. tell your dentist to take a fresh x-ray of that area including adjacent teeth. there is a possibility that you will need another rct in different tooth this time. take care.

hello i have a friend who hurt her back last night working in a nursing she took avid for the pain she ate find but she fainting but she was not breathing until i put a cold wet rag on her and started to talk to her and put a fan on her too is that the avid did that to her,2,66615,"hello, first, this is dementia with superimposed delirium. i will not be able to tell you what type of dementia with the given information. as such, the sleeping medications are not going to help. if anything, they are going to make the delirium worse. so, please refrain from giving them. other than that, make sure she is in her normal environment as much as possible. if not present, put a watch in her room. and make sure there is always light in her room. as for the diurnal variation, i think she is sleeping more during the day. so, give it your best efforts to keep her awake in the daytime-give her activities that she is/was fond of doing during the day. she does seem to have some component of paranoia. she would need anti psychotics like quetiapine. however, i would recommend taking the medicine by a prescription of a certified psychiatrist only. last but not the least-she is in delirium. she is not trying to cause you trouble. she is not listening to you because she is in delirium-in her mind and memory her husband is probably alive and since he is not around she will want to go look for him. so try to be patient with her. it might help to understand her as much as it is important that she understands you. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

a recently had rays of my lower back and have been told a have arthritis . besides a back of there is not much else that can be done except pain beds . a do not know what type it is but causes pain in lower back and at times pins and needles in my legs and at times a can not feel my legs . to you have suggestions .,1,46694,"pain in back and pain in leg this could be related to each other, or it could be separate issues also. you can check one thing lying position on your back legs straight. now when you lift your leg up straight (anyone leg) then how is your pain in leg and back. if you say pain is more in back and at the same time in leg also then it can be associated to each other, and you have problem at lumbosacral spinal level. now if there is pain only at back and there is no pain in leg follow the another test. long sitting position that is sitting only but keeping your leg straight ask someone to hold your calf muscle bulk and squeeze it or press it hard and check do you have pain in leg. if you say yes then it can be due to problem with blood circulation in legs.however the conformation can be done by only specialist like or tho or physio, and you may need to undergo for mri of back as well doppler study for legs if needed. and based on result of physical examination and mri or tho doctor for mild to moderate issue will suggest taking physiotherapy treatment and exercises along with medication. for major damage at spinal level he will suggest for needed surgical correction. now if there is circulation problem in lower limb here doctor may ask you to visit a vascular surgeon or some medications again for it. doing exercises suggested by physio for back pain radiating to legs along with use of hot and cold pack at back also gives good relief. take care."

"i am 24 year old and have lower back pain in low temp. , had meet with doctor and he suggested to take x-ray i did the same and doctor also advised me to have a medicine called `` cyclobenzaprine `` but still same problem and x-ray result was `` everything was normal but only one thing was not good and that was `` straightening of spine is seen with loss of normal curvature suggestive of muscle spasm '' what that mean i done know . please help me to resolve this problem.thank you",1,82366,"hello friend, thank you for posting your query through chat doctor. i am a homeopath answering your query and the answer which i am going to give you may contain several thoughts which may appear strange or new for you. this i say because homeopathy is a new system of medicine and is almost unheard by the majority of the population. therefore, due to the high influence of the conventional medicine the people at large are brainwashed to believe and act according to the health education given by them. coming back to the fibroadenoma of your left breast in the year 1979, you had a psychological conflict in the mind level. you are a sensitive individual and that is why your left breast was affected. it must have been related with your child chat doctor. the sensitivity is genetic, and you reacted to the conflict through the brain according to a genetic programming. mind-brain - organ affection resulted in the development of a lump in your left breast in 1979. you consulted your gynecologist, and he suggested that it may turn to become cancerous in future and so it is better to remove it, and you subdued to his suggestion. actually the lump in the breast was an attempt of the body to cure you, or it was the result of a self defense mechanism. since you had not resolved the conflict in the psychological level, the lump remained there without getting resolved. but the body kept the lump protected in a cyst with minimum amount of inflammation called chronic cystitis. by removing the fibroadenoma or chronic cystic mastitis, you were not cured, but your lump in the breast was removed. in 1995 also you are the same person, you are the same sensitive person, and you underwent another more serious psychological conflict and the same left breast was again affected in a more serious manner. instead of recognizing the mass as a defense mechanism, you got the fear in you that you have cancer. the tissue changes also suggested that there is more serious pathology, and they labelled your lump this time as cancer and suggested removal of your left breast. if you could have recognized the lump as a defense mechanism and if you had no fear of cancer, you could have retained your breast. but the fear of cancer is such that it is associated with death and so you lost your breast. in no case, either by removal of lump in 1979 or by removal of your breast in 1995, you are not cured only your disease is cured. hope by this time you have got the answer for your query. both are related to each other because they are in the same individual, same sensitivity, same program. homeopathy cures the person and once the individual is cured all his diseases will be cured. with best wishes,"

"hello , a just came across your website by aunt found out that she has a 4.6cm ovarian cyst in her left ovary since january 19th , it was a lot big before but she a been taking medicines now so it has shrunk to 4cm . the has been taking a drink made of molasses and apple cedar vinegar , heard that it a effective . but she a seeing no changes so far , her abdomen has swelled up and she a been bleeding for 2 months now . now much time does it require for an ovarian cyst to dissolve completely ? also , could you tell me the treatments for it ? any effective home remedies you know ? thanks a lot , she a really worried right now . a hope you write back soon , thank you .",1,56216,"hi thanks for choosing chat doctor for your medical query. i'm sorry but your question is deficient in a lot of information that would have been very helpful for me to answer. you have not mentioned if this was the first episode of pain, or she has past history. you did not mention if she hd any accompanying symptoms like diarrhea, vomiting, blood in stool or vomits, fever, pallor or jaundice. was her abdomen tender to touch? has the pain gotten worse, or it has subsided in intensity? is it only present in the upper abdomen or has it shifted to some other area or extended further? you also did not specify which tests and scans were ordered and came out negative. i can infer that the pain was very severe from the fact that she was hospitalized. upper abdominal pain can be due to a number of causes she might have pancreatitis, cholecystitis or peptic ulcer. pancreatic enzyme levels, ultrasound scan and h pylori antigen should be performed to rule out these conditions. as you have mentioned she had work up done at a hospital so i assume she was evaluated for these conditions. if all other tests are normal she may have functional abdominal pain. it is common amongst girls between the ages of 5 years to 14 years. it is because of an altered mechanism for pain perception so that the affected individual is more sensitive to pain. no definitive cause for this pain can be found but that does not mean it's not real. it usually presents in anxious child chat doctor. it is usually accompanied by other symptoms like recurrent diarrhea, constipation and headaches. the usual sites are around the umbilicus and in the upper abdomen. if your child has been worked up fully for all serious condition the best course of action is to reassure her. try to eliminate stress as much as possible, incorporate soluble fibers in her diet. probiotics are also helpful. do not limit her activities due to pain and try not to let her miss school. talk to her teachers and explain to them the situation. do not dismiss her pain as nothing, acknowledge its presence but try to make your child see that she has to continue her activities in a normal fashion. hope my answer helps you if you have any father questions i would be happy to answer."

my heart has been been pounding with varying intensity and frequency for several weeks . there is a cough that refuses to go after medication . what could be wrong ? my initial egg was of and thyroid function test is normal . in not a by patient nor anaemic . thanks,1,10944,"hi and thank you for your question. your fathers cough is considered a chronic cough since it lasted for more than 8 weeks. the causes of chronic cough are many and to judge better about its because it would help me to know a bit more of his cough characteristics and his medication history. in the setting of heart disease my first concern is that the highest probability of its cause is related with heart insufficiency especially if the cough is nocturnal and the cough has pink frothy secretions. in this situation the treatments that for heart insufficiency and pulmonary edema. if your father is taking an antihypertensive medication that is part of a group called a c e inhibitor like enalapril, ramipril this also is a cause of chronic cough in a group of patients, and it may begin anytime between hours to months after the first dose. the solution is to stop this medicament. does your father smoke or has smoked in the past ? he is taking an inhaler for his breathing problems so i can not exclude a chronic bronchitis and in this case if i was his treating doctor i would order a chest x-ray, pulmonary function test to decide for the treatment. i hope my opinion can be a help to you. kind regards chat doctor."

"my periods are usually 3 weeks apart and last up to 7-8 days . my husband and i have been trying to conceive for almost 9 months now and nothing has happened . recently , march 15th to be exact , i started my period and it lasted about 8 days . it want until april 21st that i got my period again . its lighter than usual , i have extreme gas pains and in slightly nauseated in the morning . should i be worried ?",1,19232,"hello christina, thank you for your query. i hope you won't mind me answering your query. your body has naturally expelled the fetal tissues. bleeding can last for up to 2 weeks. as long as you don't have abdominal pain, fever, foul smelling discharge, and prolonged /increased bleeding, you should be fine. ovulation usually occurs within 2-4 weeks after miscarriage and period will occur within 2 weeks after that. it may be a little heavier and longer than your usual period. it should regularize after that. the body takes a while to get back to normal:- to make up for lost blood-for hormone levels to normalize-uterus to regain its normal size. i recommend :-waiting for 3 months before trying to conceive again-continue folic acid supplement. -take an iron supplement every day for 3 months (depending on your hemoglobin and iron levels in the blood) more than 80% of women go on to have a normal pregnancy after a miscarriage. hope you conceive soon. take care hope ive answered your query. wish you good health."
