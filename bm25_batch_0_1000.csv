"hello , by husband is taking oxycodone due to a broken leg/surgery . be has been taking this pain medication for one month . be are trying to conceive our second baby . will this medication affect the fetus ? or the health of the baby ? or can it bring birth defects ? thank you .",1,2,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, there is no medication that can be taken by the father that has any way to get into your system or a baby if you conceive. medications can only affect a fetus if you take it while pregnant. the only issue is that certain medications may decrease a men sperm count and affect fertility, however pain medications like oxycodone do not have this effect. so there is no reason for you to worry about conceiving while taking this medication. the best way you can prepare for a healthy pregnancy is to follow a well-balanced diet, limit alcohol consumption and avoid cigarette smoke, and take a daily prenatal vitamin or folic acid, as folic acid supplements in early pregnancy helps to prevent certain types of birth defects. i hope this answers your question and best wishes for your upcoming pregnancy,"

"a sprained my foot on friday . a stepped on what a thought was lawn . instead a was a bit on the lawn , but the outside of my foot snapped down into a trough . by foot has been swollen since friday . today is thursday . kept ice on it for 24 hours . cruising started after that , now bruising is spreading . it is really dark on my toes . main is on outside of my foot , not on my ankle .",1,91875,"foot pain is extremely common and can be pretty uncomfortable. since your foot pain comes after long periods of inactivity like getting up in the morning or after having been off your feet for some time, it is likely from a combination of muscle tightness and tendonitis. tendons are the structures that connect muscle to bone to help joints move. you have tendons on the inside and outside your foot to help your foot move and to keep your foot stable. these tendons can become inflamed in some situations of overuse or other situations where they are being overworked. the mainstay of treatment for tendonitis is ice(20 min 4 times a day) and anti-inflammatories. in addition, i like to recommend a combination of soft tissue treatments and exercises for the foot. you can use a lacrosse ball on the bottom and sides of your feet to work out tight areas. you can then follow by strengthening the foot by grabbing a towel using your toes and the releasing and repeating for 3 sets of 10 twice a day. if you continue to have pain, i recommend x-rays to rule out other causes and an examination by a specialist."

i have had many signs and symptoms of pregnancy like a let period getting sick the veins on my sides are very noticeable and on my arms and chest and legs but i took a test it came back negative and then i was a week late but after that i got my period . is there any way i could still be pregnant ? i also have leg cramps and pains in my arms too,1,49266,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. if you last had your period on september 12th, and today is october 5th, your period is not yet late for october. most women have a 25-35 day cycle, so until you actually miss your period for october, there is no reason to assume you are pregnant. the folic acid and zinc you are taking are just extra vitamins that provide health to a growing pregnancy; these should not affect or change your menstrual cycle or its symptoms. if your period is late in october, you should purchase and perform an over-the-counter pregnancy test. modern pregnancy tests are very accurate and can be positive even 10 days after conception. if you do find out you are pregnant, there is nothing that needs to be done immediately as pregnancy is not a disease- it is a normal state for women in the reproductive phase of their lives. so it is important only to keep taking your vitamins, get plenty of rest, eat a balanced diet and avoid alcohol, caffeine and chat doctor. if your period is mate, but you are not pregnant, the delay in your cycle can have a number of causes, including hormonal imbalances, certain medical conditions like thyroid disease, and even the stress of worrying about pregnancy. if you miss more than 2 months of your cycle (no bleeding for 3 months) and your pregnancy test is negative, you should see a physician for a hormonal evaluation. so in summary, a late menstrual cycle can be caused by pregnancy, but there are other causes as well. i suggest you perform a pregnancy test if you are late, and if it is negative, try to be patient, and you will likely get it before another month goes by. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"a feel fine in the morning and all day but for the last two days a have been getting very dizzy at the end of the day , around 4:30 to 5:00 and a little lightheaded . a haven changed any eating patterns or anything , what is the most common cause for random dizziness ?",1,103810,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. generic medications have the same active ingredients as the brand name chat doctor. i have seen many patients who have new side effects when changing from a brand name to a generic, or substituting one generic for another. the breakthrough bleeding with messina may improve over time, but if you are feeling lightheaded and dizzy you should call your healthcare provider and have an examination to check for anemia or any other reasons you feel lightheaded. unless you are bleeding very heavily (changing a soaked pad every hour) it is unlikely you have lost enough blood to become symptomatic from 6 days of breakthrough bleeding, so a medical evaluation really needs to be done for your light-headedness. in the meantime, i would also contact the doctor who prescribed you the messina and see if you could be changed to a pill with a slightly higher dose of estrogen. the amount of estrogen is what helps to control your menstrual cycle on the pill, and you may benefit temporarily for a change in brand. also, if your local pharmacy doesn't stock avian, another pharmacy in your area may have it and changing pharmacies may help you to get more of the brand that works best for you. i hope i was able to answer your questions today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"a feel sure of husband has had and of still having mini strokes . of have had every test done that the doctor ask , the last thing suggested was another mri of his brain but of has not been scheduled yet . what should a of and how soon of of necessary . of can not walk his left leg of numb and of of having trouble knowing when of of using the bathroom , both urinating and bowel movements . of stays confused all the time .",1,51003,"i read your question carefully, and i understand your concern. the diagnosis of ms is made by symptoms and signs coupled with mri. since you don't mention to have had any mri lately we are left only with the tingling and movement disorder (which is a little unclear). tingling can be a manifestation of ms but so can it be a manifestation of many brain lesions. in your case given your history with the accident, the coma and subsequent seizures it is to be assumed that a brain lesion has happened due to the accident, and it has left a damaged area which could well justify the symptoms. so to conclude i would consider it far more likely the symptoms to be due to the brain injury rather than you having a whole new neurological condition (frankly what are the chances of that on top of what you already have). in order to completely exclude ms an mri can be scheduled. i hope to have been of help."

"by mother is having lightheadedness and heart palpitations and sometimes her hear races . this has been over the last few days . the just checked her blood pressure and it is normal and her pulse rate is 72 . would she still have a heart attack with normal blood pressure and pulse rate ? thanks , kelli",1,99967,"i read your question carefully, and i understand your concern. beta blockers can at times excessively slow heart rate or lower blood pressure and lead to weakness and tiredness. however, that is easily established by measuring blood pressure and checking her pulse and measure her pulse rate which can be easily done at home. if rate is over 60 beats per minute and blood pressure is not low then i do not think that the beta blocker is the cause. in that case other possibility should be looked at starting with anemia, liver and kidney conditions etc. for that some routine blood tests for blood count, glucose, liver and kidney function, electrolyte panel are advised. i hope to have been of help."

"a just had an mri on thursday , ave had many mris in the last 10 years but this was my first experience in a 3.0 tesla imaging unit . a have relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis and am on tysabri as my disease modifying drug , a have tested positive for the of virus { papovavirus } and so my mris are to watch out for possible signs of pml . by head has been pounding off and on since thursday and a was wondering if this is common in higher tesla mris .",1,78318,"hello dear,first, my reassurance for you. we, the doctors, treat the patients and not the mris. the very basic of a clinical practice is to correlate the clinical symptoms and signs of patients with investigations. in fact, in the older days, when there were no mris, patients used to be diagnosed accurately with precise clinical skills of the doctor. investigations are meant just to supplement the clinical findings and not to replace the clinical history and examination of the patient. coming on to spring in mri-the appearance of spring is a linear slit like hyperintense signal in mri spine, which is to be correlated for sure with the clinical findings of the patient like limb weakness, atrophy or thinning of the limb, fasciculations. in absence of these, or in a completely normal individual, i would rather say it has more chances to be some artifact, if at all is there. many hyperintense signals in mris don't have any clinical relevance. just to mention,30 percent of normal brain mris have hyperintense signals, that doesn't mean, we start treating every normal person for nothing he has got. one question-why were you visiting or tho surgeon? one tip for your reassurance-please visit a neurologist and get examined yourself, if any problem. i hope it helped."

"i , in a 27 or old female and over the past 2 yrs i have been getting left sided chest pain , and pain in my left rib that also radiates to the back . my 3rd rib is protruding as that what my doctor said . i feel breathless a i get skipped he everyone i get pain in that rib . a have had a rays done but everything seems normal .",1,37799,"hi, thank you for providing the brief history of you. as you mentioned you have a stabbing pain in the shoulder which radiates to the rib cage and also your heart checkup was done which is all fine. you need a thorough neuromuscular assessment which will help us if the pathology is in the cervical region, shoulder region, rib cage or abdomen? also, with the orthopedic and neurological special test we can come closer to the root cause. besides, pain in the shoulder which is stabbing is related to either a shoulder joint pathology or cervical spine pathology. the pain in the rib cage for which chest examination is required. may be pathology of the lungs which is very uncommon to predict also, since pain cannot be because of it as well. the pain in the lower part of the rib cage for which an ultrasound scan of the abdomen will help assist further. the pain in the shoulder and rib cage can be not connected as the nerve supply, blood supply and the muscle innervation are totally different. so both pathologies are different. for stabbing pain in shoulder the pathology will be related to either the cervical spine or the shoulder. and for pain in the rib cage, the pathology can be related to chest or abdomen. both needs a different assessment and different approach to diagnosis. i will recommend undergoing a neuromuscular assessment by which we can differentiate both the pathologies and help you better. for shoulder pain, with proper rest, medication and physical therapy things fall into place. regardsjay in chat doctor."

"a started off with a bad cold about a month ago . a seemed to get better about a week or so after a first initially started to feel ill. after a few days it came back and was worse than before . now 4 weeks later , the only symptom a still have is the severe coughing spells that will sometimes lead to vomiting .",1,110792,"hello, thanks for using chat doctor i have read your query with a lot of concern. the first thing i find is a little ambiguity as to why your hit were positive and two weeks later negative. it most likely scenario is that the hit gave false positive results. normally, pregnancy test becomes positive at two weeks after fertilization i.e. about the time the next menses was about to start, and the first symptom thus is absent of menses in most cases. if truly, the tests were positive, then you might have been pregnant long before you even started taking the chat doctor. however, this is also ambiguous because it requires averagely three weeks for the test to become negative after termination of pregnancy. if you recently became pregnant and it's less than 4 weeks(you have not yet missed your period), the hit will be negative. best regards"

"i , a am 36 weeks pregnant . all my reports have been fine considering baby weight , amniotic fluid & doppler flow . however , my last ultrasound a couple of days ago showed the baby in a head up position with a single loop of cord around neck . an a still have a normal delivery ? can the baby turn on its own in due course of time to engage in head down position , before my delivery date which is 14th feb. ?",1,284,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. if your baby is in the head up position at term, it is not recommended that you deliver vaginally, because there is risk to the baby of birth injury. so if you reach your due date with your baby in the head up position, your obstetrician will likely recommend cesarean section. however, there is a possibility that the baby could turn around on its own. ways to help this to happen is to do what you can to let your belly hang to give the baby a chance to rollover. going on your hands and knees and arching your back high into the air, like an angry cat, for 10 minutes every day, can sometimes help the baby to turn around naturally. however, the best way to help the baby to turn around is for your obstetrician or midwife to perform a procedure called a version. in the us, versions, which literally are done by the doctor pushing the baby into a somersault is performed under ultrasound guidance in a hospital setting. it works about 50% of the time and can give a woman a chance at a normal vaginal delivery. regarding the cord around the babies neck, 15% of normally delivered infants have an umbilical cord around their neck. so the presence of the cord around the neck now does not mean that there will be any problems with labor and delivery if the baby is able to get into the right position. if you are considering having a version, i suggest that you speak to your delivering provider about it soon, as the success rates of version decrease significantly after 37 weeks. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and this information was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy and delivery,"

"hello , a was diagnosed with hepatitis a for the last seven months back , my first doctor has put me on antiviral drugs lemuvudine but later i was advise by the second doctor to stop taking the medicine because the viral load was low and it does to qualified me for treatment and later liver biopsy was done but i don to have the various in my liver but since then my liver enzymes keep on elevating especially the alt , alkaline , bilirubin , total protein , get & at times the mentions ones also reduce though hiv a varia load was done later and it was below 25mm in dna . that could be the problem am so scared of liver cancer and crisis . secondly can someone grow up with hepatitis a from child hood up to the age of 60s ? if so what is the life span of the person having a chronic hiv a ?",1,5256,"hi, how are you? my name is chat doctor. thanks for writing to chat doctor and i hope to answer your question today. hepatitis c virus, as i am sure you are aware, damages the liver cells. the liver has an enormous capacity to regenerate, meaning if part of the liver is damaged, then new liver cells are formed to replace the damaged liver (unlike skin where damaged skin is replaced by scar). the problem with hepatitis c is, it is present constantly in the blood and liver and continues to damage the liver continuously. just like a rubber band can be stretched only so far before it snaps, so is the regenerative capacity of the liver. depending on how virulent the hepatitis c strain is, over the course of 10-30 yrs, the liver exhausts its capacity to regenerate and just like skin, the damaged liver cells starts getting replaced by scar tissue - this leads to hardening of the normal supple liver - a condition known as liver fibrosis which later on leads to liver cirrhosis. the problem with this is, under normal circumstances anywhere between 1200 and 1500 ml of blood flows through the liver per min. when the liver is normal and supple, this blood can flow easily through the liver. but when the liver begins to stiffen or harden as in the case of cirrhosis, this blood is met with great resistance during its flow through the liver. this is called as ""portal hypertension"". so the blood starts to look for alternate routes to return to the heart and the most accessible route for it is through the veins of the food pipe (esophagus and stomach). the problem with this is, the veins in the esophagus and stomach are very thin walled and are not used to carrying this much volume of blood. so they distend to a great degree (a condition called as varices) and sometime even rupture with catastrophic consequences. this is easily diagnosed by upper gi endoscopy where the largely dilated veins can be seen. but in your case, since multiple upper gi endoscopies have not demonstrated any varices, it means your liver has not reached a state of ""portal hypertension"" yet and the disease seems not be progressing or is ""stable"". if i was your doctor, i would also get a ""fibrosis"" which is a special scan of the liver to look at the amount of stiffness or hardening of the liver. this can be repeated regularly to see the progression of the fibrosis. i would also explore the different treatments for hepatitis c infection. the gold standard is of course a liver biopsy which will demonstrate the exact status of your liver. i hope this helped, and i do hope you will get better soon. please write back to me if you need any further clarifications especially the treatment options available to treat hepatitis c. have a great day"

a drank with friends one weekend and skipped my birth control for 2 days and the very next day i got my period . a week later my period stopped and i started getting sharp pains in my vagina and a started bleeding again . did a have a miscarriage then a regular period or a elongated period with sharp pains ?,2,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

a have a small white pain painful lump on the bottom of my foot . it is surrounded by red infected type colour . a first thought a had something stuck in my foot but a cant find anything . its getting more painful every day and getting quiet hard to put any pressure on my foot .,1,91875,"foot pain is extremely common and can be pretty uncomfortable. since your foot pain comes after long periods of inactivity like getting up in the morning or after having been off your feet for some time, it is likely from a combination of muscle tightness and tendonitis. tendons are the structures that connect muscle to bone to help joints move. you have tendons on the inside and outside your foot to help your foot move and to keep your foot stable. these tendons can become inflamed in some situations of overuse or other situations where they are being overworked. the mainstay of treatment for tendonitis is ice(20 min 4 times a day) and anti-inflammatories. in addition, i like to recommend a combination of soft tissue treatments and exercises for the foot. you can use a lacrosse ball on the bottom and sides of your feet to work out tight areas. you can then follow by strengthening the foot by grabbing a towel using your toes and the releasing and repeating for 3 sets of 10 twice a day. if you continue to have pain, i recommend x-rays to rule out other causes and an examination by a specialist."

"in the past couple months a have been having an extreme sharp pain in my left abdomen . the pain causes me to be unable to breath and a fall to the floor unable to move because of how severe the pain is . a went to the doctor for it and gave them all my symptoms , period for 6 weeks , fatigued , headaches , heartburn . all of my tests came back normal , but a have still having this pain and when it hits it is very scary.do you have any idea of what it could be or what my next step should be ?",1,56216,"hi thanks for choosing chat doctor for your medical query. i'm sorry but your question is deficient in a lot of information that would have been very helpful for me to answer. you have not mentioned if this was the first episode of pain, or she has past history. you did not mention if she hd any accompanying symptoms like diarrhea, vomiting, blood in stool or vomits, fever, pallor or jaundice. was her abdomen tender to touch? has the pain gotten worse, or it has subsided in intensity? is it only present in the upper abdomen or has it shifted to some other area or extended further? you also did not specify which tests and scans were ordered and came out negative. i can infer that the pain was very severe from the fact that she was hospitalized. upper abdominal pain can be due to a number of causes she might have pancreatitis, cholecystitis or peptic ulcer. pancreatic enzyme levels, ultrasound scan and h pylori antigen should be performed to rule out these conditions. as you have mentioned she had work up done at a hospital so i assume she was evaluated for these conditions. if all other tests are normal she may have functional abdominal pain. it is common amongst girls between the ages of 5 years to 14 years. it is because of an altered mechanism for pain perception so that the affected individual is more sensitive to pain. no definitive cause for this pain can be found but that does not mean it's not real. it usually presents in anxious child chat doctor. it is usually accompanied by other symptoms like recurrent diarrhea, constipation and headaches. the usual sites are around the umbilicus and in the upper abdomen. if your child has been worked up fully for all serious condition the best course of action is to reassure her. try to eliminate stress as much as possible, incorporate soluble fibers in her diet. probiotics are also helpful. do not limit her activities due to pain and try not to let her miss school. talk to her teachers and explain to them the situation. do not dismiss her pain as nothing, acknowledge its presence but try to make your child see that she has to continue her activities in a normal fashion. hope my answer helps you if you have any father questions i would be happy to answer."

"a am 6 1/2 months pregnant . joke up this morning having chest pain . a didst pay mind to it and continued with my day . afternoon a took two tylenol thinking the pain would go away and it hast . the pain is my dead center chest , in between my breast . feeling like a cant breath . like my chest is having in and someone punched me there a few times . that is it ? ? ? ? ?",1,41649,"hello. thank you for your question and welcome to chat doctor. i understand your concern. well, i am going to try and explain the differences between various origins of the pain which can arise from the rib cage. there is angina. it is described more like mid-chest heaviness or squeezing sensation, that is triggered by exercise and relieved by rest, which radiates to the both sides of the chest, to the jaw and left arm and shoulder. it is indicative of a blockage within one or more coronary arteries and reflects the lowering of blood supply to the heart muscle. an ekg obtained in the moment of chest pain, if it fills this description, would be helpful. then there is pleuritic chest pain. this kind of pain is sharp, stabbing pain that can happen in any part of the chest area. no radiation like in anginal pain. it arises from acute or chronic inflammation of the linings that are within the rib cage: pleura (lining of the lungs) or pericardium (lining of the heart) or both. in this regard, i would recommend a chest x-ray for pleural inflammation or effusion. in case of pericardial pain and anginal pain, echocardiogram is helpful, by evaluating the size, motility and function of heart muscle and valves, and also by assessing the pericardium and whether there is fluid build-up within it, or not. other causes of chest pain are related to the locomotion system of the rib cage: muscle soreness, bone and cartilage-related pain. in the end, stress can also cause chest pain. i hope i was helpful with my answer. best regards,"

(as you said he has difficulty in walking now). you can also say to his parents that --- they can continue with all religious customs along with medicines, may be then they will agree... with medicine, he will start showing improvement in few days only... it is psychosis and patients will not agree to go to any doctor willingly, so you might need to take him forcefully. this is well accepted as it is for his benefit only. even if he doesn't agree for oral medicine there are injectables which are given to such patients... take the right step, take him to a doctor. hope the reply is useful feel free to ask more questions"

a have regularly period because a have pcos a had took birth control for 12 months but when a had stopped taking them my period was regular for just three months my 4th one is late now .. a was wondering if a should take something else now ? and if the total fertility supplement pcos will help in my case ? a will appreciate your kind answer pm really tired because of this ... thank you,1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"hello , my 2 and a half year old has been having tiny amount of blood at the end of the stool ... my paediatrician ordered an sex ray and said she was constipated evan though she poops quite regularly.he said most likely the blood comes from a scratch at the end of the bowel that continually gets irritated and then today the stool turned gray ! half of it came out brown then gray and two hours later more grey poop what could this mean ?",1,33660,"hi there, the backed up stool and tendency to urinary tract infection does point to the idea that she could be constipated, despite being regular. regarding the frequency of bowel movements, do note that different people tend to have different bowel needs, up to 3 times a day is accepted as normal. so she could actually be going daily and still be relatively constipated. what we are aiming for is the right consistency of stools, which is long and sausage-like, with or without cracks. if you need more visual guidance, look for the bristol stool chart online, and aim for type 3 or 4. it is good that she is taking enough fibers, but also pay attention to her habits and stress to her that she needs to go when she feels like it even if it is more than once a day. constipation often occurs at this age because this is when they are getting better at holding it in, and prefer other exciting activities to sitting in the toilet. the other rarer possibility would be that she has a mild form of hirschsprungs disease, which means that some nerves are missing from the end of the colon, making the evacuating of stool difficult. most people have this diagnosed as babies, but if its very mild it can be missed. it might be more likely if she had delayed bowel movement more than a day after birth, or had tendency to constipation even as a baby. you will have to discuss with your doctor on this possibility, because confirmation would be needed with a rectal biopsy. hope this helps, and all the best to you."

i sir my wife is in 7th month pregnant and she has been facing gestational diabetic in early stages ( 3rd month ) and doctor suggested insulin and slowly increasing the lots now . she is taking novomix 30 pencil . morning 18 lots and evening 10 lots . very week we are taking test by using glucometer . bayer product . but some time test results are showing 84-98 and 112-158. she was getting fear kindly give your suggestions,1,687,"hello and i hope i can help you today. insulin is used to treat diabetes during pregnancy at all stages and is safe and effective. the disease of diabetes and high blood sugar is the part that is dangerous for the baby, and good glucose control is the best way to ensure a healthy child. good blood glucose levels should be less that 95 for fasting levels and less than 120 after meals (2 hours). if this is the way your wife checks her sugar, and you test at least 4 times daily, she is under very good control and should not need further adjustment of her insulin if her levels stay at the current level. she should be checking her sugar fasting and then 2 hours after every meal. so in summary, insulin is safe and absolutely necessary for the health of the baby if your wife has diabetes. please discuss the dosing regimen with your treating physician on a regular basis and make sure your wife checks her readings at least when she wakes up in the morning and then 2 hours after every meal. she should also write down what she eats, so her doctor can also know if any changes need to be made in the diet. i hope this information was helpful and answered your question adequately. best wishes to you and your wife for the rest of the pregnancy. sincerely,"

"i recently started playing girls water polo at school and yesterday whale i was showering and cleaning my body i found a bump on my butt and when i touched it , it hurt . and today at school when i would sit it would hurt i have no idea what this is or what it can be i have never had anything like this before",1,74210,"hello! thank you for the query. yes, umbilical hernia can always be a reason of abdominal pain. however, it can be also asymptomatic. hernia is simply a hole in the abdominal wall. when the hole is small, but big enough to let intestine or momentum to get through, the contents of hernia gets squeezed and that is what hurts. so if in your belly button is a lump which hurts when you pres it, that can be the cause of your symptoms. if hernia is empty, it should not hurt at all. if it is about ascites, in most cases it does not hurt at all. the only way it can hurt, is when there is so much liquid inside your abdomen, that intestines gets squeezed, and it can lead to intestine blockage. but it would be easily visible, and your abdomen would become unnaturally big, like with big ball inside. hope this will answer your questions. regards"

"hi there , in 6 weeks pregnant and since yesterday morning i started having pinkish discharge on wiping with no pain i did a chatdoctor level it was 1280 . today it was repeated and became 1450. they couldn't find a sac on transvaginal u/s intro or intrauterine . the bleeding has become less today . i had cramps in the morning through the afternoon but they a resolving . after taking ivfc injection",1,1599,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the morning after pill is 90 percent effective if taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse. so, regardless of what happened with your pill taking before your pill-free week, the morning-after pill should still be effective. many women have a delayed period after taking the morning-after pill as a side effect, but the possibility of pregnancy still exists if you are late, so you should perform a urine pregnancy test just in case. if it has not been 2 weeks yet since your unprotected encounter, it may be too early to have a positive pregnancy test, so i would repeat it in a week if that is the case. in addition, many women have an irregular period or skip entirely after they stop the pill. if you are not pregnant, you can start a new pack of pills as soon as you get them, but just use a condom as a backup for the first two weeks. you should get a period in the pill-free week as you did previously. i hope i was able to answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"last sunday i passed out . when my friend checked on me , i was unresponsive . when at the hospital my blood pressure was 76/48 . after regaining consciousness , i couldn't speak correctly or move my right leg and arm . within a day , i was back to normal and prescribed nothing and given no answers . what happened to me ?",1,57412,"hi, i couldn't help respond after reading your post. i have eczema and had the same problems you described. approximately two years ago, i contracted a steph infection from working in the hospital. i had this infection for the least two years. i went to several specialists, and they all kept saying it was contact dermatitis and gave me anti-inflammatory creams and steroids. after becoming very weak and itchy all over, i couldn't take it anymore. i finally chat doctor. i was finally diagnosed with a skin steph infection. he said it was caused from me itching from my eczema that the bacteria entered my skin and it's not uncommon for doctors to misdiagnose. i was given bacterium antibiotic cream to put on the affected areas and also bacterium antibiotics pills. i was told that the doctor should have known that there was an infection going on because my skin was warm to the touch and also my c-reactive protein level in my blood was high. it does sound like you might have an infection. treat it with antibiotics, bacterium the for a month or so and you should find yourself feeling better. good luck"

[don't worry i am not saying you had a heart attack]. in addition, anemia also causes decreased blood supply to the body organs including the heart. therefore first we must rule out a cardiac cause. first an ekg, complete blood count, cardiac enzymes test and a 2 d echo should be done. if all these reports come out as normal as you can be relieved. next a treadmill test which requires you to walk on the treadmill while your ekg is continuously monitored is advice. if this treadmill test is negative, you can stop worrying about heart attack now. treadmill test should be done only after ecg, enzymes and echo in your case. in the meantime you can self examine your breasts for any lump or mass. if you can feel any mass or lump a mammography is advice. if you still get the pain despite these tests then a short course of nsaids like diclofenac can be taken along with antacids-pantoprazole 40 mg twice daily before meals. wishing you good health. thank you"

hi there after being bullied at work some 5 months ago by two of my colleagues a was told last week that a would a would be being moved out 2 days later a felt dizzy and have been told by my up that a have vertigo could this be work related regards plan,3,100009,"greetings! thank you for your question and welcome to chat doctor. i carefully read your query. mitral valve prolapse (mvp) is a benign condition that is estimated to be found in 16% of young ladies, and it may take up to forty or fifty years to produce symptoms, only after a chronic mitral regurgitation is installed. i would go on and say that further clinical investigation should be in order at this time, but i am quite confident that, if something was wrong with the mitral valve and the mitral regurgitation was there, it would have been told to you during the before 6 months echocardiogram. it would be only when a mitral regurgitation produced by a mitral valve prolapse that would enlarge the left atrium, when the high pressures in the enlarged left atrium would produce shortness of breath and, maybe, rapid heart rate corresponding with an atrial arrhythmia. and it would have shown in the echocardiogram, if the left atrium was enlarged. my opinion is that your problem is not being produced by the mitral valve prolapse, at this moment, at least. however, if this is a worrisome situation to you, then another echocardiogram should be done. of course, if mitral valve is found on a bad shape, after carefully measuring the function, size, and grade of regurgitation, adding to the possible symptoms, it is only then when mitral valve should be surgically replaced. as for the stress side, indeed substantial amounts of stress have their clear effect on the heart, by putting it to a significant dynamic state and by producing a chat doctor. there are a lot of natural means to reduce stress, starting from self-fighting of the stress to yoga or other methods. if this becomes problematic to you and affects your quality of life and work, i would recommend you a consult with a clinical psychologist regarding a course of sedatives to reduce it. i hope i was helpful. best regards."

(however the hbv dna is not done in your case) reactivation of hbv disease occurs when a person is in the inactive bag carrier state and develops elevated liver enzyme and hbv dna levels and, in some patients, detectable head if the wild type virus is the dominant infection. we would advise you to get the lft evaluated and the antibodies of anti cab and bsa done after 6 months. if the bag is positive after 6 months then you might be going into chronicity which happens in only 10% cases. we would also suggest you to get your wife vaccinated (if married) with hep b vaccine if she is not yet exposed to. furthermore you need your child chat doctor. apart from this we would suggest you to take good nutritious diet. we hope these information would be useful for you in follow up. please get back to us for father queries or chat with our doctor from 9 to 9 ist daily. regards"

"by boyfriend was recently diagnosed with wolff-parkinson-white syndrome . a did some research , and discovered that he has nearly all of the symptoms of heart block and many of the symptoms of heart failure . whenever he has an episode with his heart , he gets very dizzy , nauseous , has chest pain and cold sweats , and eventually has a blackout . is there anything that a can do to alleviate his symptoms when they occur ?",1,42779,"hi there! i totally understand your concern for your father and commend you for looking out for him. usually, the signs and symptoms of a heart attack is a crushing chest pain (patients will often say that they feel like an elephant is sitting on their chest). if he has constant chest pain, a heart attack is possible, but less likely. i'm not sure what bacteria he has, but taking penicillin for a stomach infection is unusual. the only stomach infection that i am aware of that is treated by antibiotics is h. pylori, and that is treated by a combination of antibiotics (and penicillin is not one of them). antibiotics tend to alter the flora of our gi tract (there are natural bacteria that live in the gi tract, and taking antibiotics can also kill the good bacteria). i would ask the doctor who prescribed the antibiotic what exactly he is trying to treat (penicillin is a very unusual choice for gi infections, period). i would also get him an ekg, which would check for any abnormalities going on with his heart. furthermore, i certainly do think that his medications could be playing a role. i'd recommend revisiting his medications and going over potential side effects with his doctor, especially the penicillin. i hope this helps. feel free to contact me if you have any further questions. thanks!"

pm in the hospital . 2nd case of ischaemic colitis in 7 months . ave had 2 previous heart attacks and a moderate aortic leak . a understand the ischaemic colitis is caused by lack of blood flow to the colon . that causes the lack of blood flow ? to doctor can answer that yet .,1,907,"hello welcome to chat doctor ischemic colitis is caused due to obstruction to blood flow of the colon. cholesterol deposition in the arteries of the body lead to narrowing of the arteries. this is called atherosclerosis. some subjects have increased tendency to atherosclerosis which depends on genetics and environmental factors. this causes narrowing of the arteries leading to stagnation of blood at these sites and subsequent formation of clots. this causes you the attacks of ischemic colitis. in you case since you have suffered from two heart attacks, i suppose you have got high propensity to atherosclerosis, may be due to genetic factors and strong family history. treatment is blood thinners like aspirin which i suppose you are already on. usually two blood thinners are used on recurrent attacks of ischemic colitis and even in case of previous heart attacks. so ideally you must be on two blood thinners. if despite this you have episodes of ischemic colitis you must be on higher blood thinners like warfarin. however, higher blood thinners have a potential of causing bleeding elsewhere in the body. i hope i have answered your query satisfactorily. wishing you good healthregards."

"a went to the dentist a few months ago to get a retainer ( the clear plastic one ) and it creates big ulcers so bad that i cant put it back in . to after a few month i went back and hes letting me try again , but the ulcer has come back in the exact same spot . is this because of the retainer ?",1,96784,hellooo...read through your query...accordingly i must say that it's very important to wear retainer till the dentist say otherwise the teeth may go back to position before treatment and all your money and handwork will all be wasted...regarding swelling nothing has to be worried.it will reduce once u finish this treatment phase(retainer is also part of treatment)it's just the muscles of cheek are reacting to the retainers action...if u have pain and ulceration etc. u should meet your dentist and get it adjusted...so as for now my advice would be continued with retainer and have a superb smile...happiness and calmness is the best part of life...be cool and happy...hope your benefitted something from this reply .have a healthy day!!!

"hello , a will occasionally get a lump and dark spot on the right side of my tongue . always in the same spot it seems to last for a day or two and then go away . a can catch it by running my tongue through my teeth but it is embedded in my tongue and gives like a purple cast to that area . normally it is more of an annoyance than anything but this time it kind of hurts . a am wondering if it is a cyst or a blood clot ? to i make an appointment to go to my doctor , dentist , or just wait for it to go away ?",1,47722,"hello and thank you for your question. any time you have a red lesion on the side of the tongue that persists longer than a few weeks it is important to have it evaluated in person by a dentist and possibly biopsied. oral cancer can occur at any age and is very common on the side of the tongue. the tried and true method of identification is through biopsy. many lesions can appear flat, red and on the side of the tongue. highly unlikely that it is cancer at your age, but safe to rule out if it doesn't go away. geographical tongue does have a border but not always apparent. it can also be lichen plans, trauma from an adjacent tooth, chemical burn from medication, new toothpaste, mouth rinse or spicy/citric foods. i hope this helps you. best wishes, good health."

i am 19 years old i have a habit of masturbation which is about 3 times in two weeks but when there is a gap of more than 3 weeks when i done do masturbation there is this craving whicchatdoctores resulting in masturbation about 5 times daily and i just done have any control on it i fail to concentrate on studies and watch continuous pornography could a please suggest me some medications so that i can get rid of this problem permanently,1,33447,"hi, masturbation itself is not a bad habit if done 2 -3 times a week and not more than once a day. it is a safe sexual practice among most people at your age as a way of sexual exploration. if you do more than 2 -3 times in a week and more than once daily then you must control yourself. the side effects of excessive masturbation includes not achieving a strong erection and decreased semen volume. masturbation also can cause you problems in daily life including work and studies with loss of concentration and significant negative emotions which can predispose you to sexual addictive behavior. at first please keep away from any kind of pornography material that you have and avoid staying alone in your room or at home. whenever thoughts of masturbation come, you must go out to the exteriors and have walks or meet friends. to stop such thoughts at night, you can start listening to good music and start doing some work or rad books. in the beginning you keep a target of not masturbating for at least 10 days and follow it even if you get strong urges to do it. after this is achieved, start increasing your target and soon try not masturbating for a month. please do not touch your genitals except when you are urinating or passing motions. unnecessary stimulation of genitals also causes thoughts of masturbation."

a have been diagnosed yet again with another uti with klebsiella being the bug that is always found in my urine . the or says it is not caught from my partner but every time a have sex with him a am back to the hrs again complaining of the same symptoms . sometimes the urine samples show nothing but most of the time it does . why is it that a no sooner get rid of the infection then have sex and the infection starts all over again . a a beginning to wonder if my partner is the cause of all of this . never ever had this issue before with any other partner . a a in my 40 a and have been with my partner for 2 years and am completely monogamous ( never have numerous partners ) . a a so over this please help me,1,945,"hello, klebsiella is mostly and primarily found in not immunocompetent individuals, usually in hospital settings and cause the so-called hospital-acquired infections (hai). they could cause opportunistic urinary tract infections, pneumonia and other respiratory infections, bacteremia, infection of surgical wounds, etcetera. in diabetics, people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, etcetera. due to their particular structure, klebsiella species are naturally resistant to penicillin-type antibiotics, some aminoglycosides (gentamicin, kanamycin, streptomycin, etcetera.). often their treatment is possible only through the use of carbapenems and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, etcetera.). klebsiella is considered part of the normal flora in various parts of intestine and colon. recent studies have reported that recurrent klebsiella urinary tract infections are caused by persistent klebsiella found in the urinary tract even after appropriate antibiotic treatment and all persons with recurrent infections were elderly and diabetics. recurrent strains of klebsiella also had increased adhesion and invasiveness compared to colonization strains (those causing infection for the first time) and this might explain their tendency to cause repeated infections. now, it is known that frequent sexual intercourse is the strongest risk factor for recurrent urinary tract infections in healthy women, and it is why your disease comes back each time you have sex with your partner. the fact that the disease comes back after you have sex with your partner puts in high risk of future urinary tract infections. in your case the following measures could be of benefit: 1. continuous antibiotic prophylaxis for six months, by using low doses of the antibiotic that is more effective in your case. you have to consult with your doctor about which antibiotic you will use and for how long.2. post-coital therapy, by applying a single dose of the most effective antibiotic each time after having sex. you again have to consult with your doctor about the dose and type of antibiotic. 3. apply the so-called post-coital voiding that is: urinating immediately after sex.4. you should maintain high genital hygiene as it could help as well. it is also important that you have a thorough evaluation by radiological examinations in order to rule out abnormalities of the urinary tract (anatomical or functional) that could boost infection recurrence. lastly, klebsiella is not transmitted sexually, thus clearly your partner has nothing to do with your recurrent infections. but, during each intercourse, it is easier for the bacteria to get contact with your urinary tract (remember that klebsiella is a normal part of intestinal tract and colon). hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"that is causing me to keep bumps with puss all over the back of my head ? different shampoos seem to make it more irritating than others . a have tried all kinds of things and have been to two skin doctors and nothing works , but the nail fungus pill medicine ?",1,76860,"hi, thank you for providing a brief history of your illness. since you mentioned you have met an accident and injured the t8 level spinal column area and the neurosurgeon have decompressed it. understanding the scene here is you are a bit annoyed by the bladder control, movement of legs and abnormal sensation. now since it's been 2 years and a much done onto for your good till date by all specialists. help is always an inch away and doctors are always here to help. i wish to know if you have tried doing physiotherapy, if not than you should start it again. as the surgery was successful the later part was to take the regular medicines and regular physiotherapy. bladder control exercises are known to a physiotherapist which he can teach you and brain always tends to keep learning. now since you are looking here with some remedy for you, i would say that the doctors have done a great job till date, now you have to put a conscious effort to undergo a physiotherapy session and get yourself helped. physiotherapy is not only about exercise but even about the deeper science behind it. all things done till now by doctors was excellent, now the body has to produce some internal medicine which has to make a help. symptomatic help was done at the best. now it's the body turn to produce the requirements. i have seen many patients with such injuries and on the later side of the years are helped by a physiotherapist and things have turn on a positive side for many. kindly try to undergo physiotherapy and make the body metabolic system to take the next charge. it's never easy to get back on but it's never impossible to become better again. with the grace of almighty i wish you a positive outcome soon."

husband had an endoscopy during the procedure found white spots . book a biopsy and thought it was fungus . found out today not the case . white blood count low told might be an infection . not for sure needs another scope in a few months . making beds for acid reflux . that could it be ?,1,26797,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. low white blood cells (which are the disease-fighting cells in your body) can occur both as a result of a disease that lowers your white cell count (like hiv) or by consumption when your body is working hard to clear an infection. in your case, your doctors were concerned you had an infection in your body causing your white blood cells to fall. they found the infection in your kidneys and prescribed an antibiotic, which is it works, should clear the infection and your white cell count will return to normal. your white cell count and you're having a kidney infection does not affect the baby at all as long as you are treated properly and follow your doctors' advice. my only concern is that if you truly have a kidney infection, amoxicillin is not a particularly strong antibiotic for urinary tract infections. so if you have taken the medication for a few days, and you still have fever higher than 38.5 celsius, (101f) or bad flank pain occasionally iv antibiotics are needed for treatment. i hope my answer was helpful for you today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"
