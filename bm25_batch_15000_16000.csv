i have been experiencing some numbness of arms total numbness of hands during sleep it wakes me up they have no feeling then they turn white with red streaks in the joint lines of the fingers and start to move them around do daily activities they tingle and come a little more feeling back at a time until they burn like they are of fire and ache up to my elbow its miserable been going on for about 2 months on and off allay,1,89135,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the bumps you likely are feeling on your cervix are most likely nathan cysts rather than polyps. polyps are fleshy soft growths that are just out pouching of the normal glands that line the canal of the cervix. it would be difficult to feel them, and they usually cause irregular bleeding or bleeding after sex. they do not cause infertility (uterine polyps can, but those are not the same and are not possible to feel because they are inside your uterus. nabothian cysts are just blocked mucus glands that can feel like knobby bumps on the cervix. they also are not harmful and do not interfere with fertility. both of these findings on your cervix can be seen on a spectrum exam, so a gun doctor would be able to tell you what you are feeling if they looked inside you. also, regarding the position of your cervix, this also has no bearing on fertility and does not change from month to month, so you do not need to check your cervix regularly especially if you have a yearly gynecologic checkup. regarding bbt charting for conception, your temperature goes up after you ovulate, so i recommend not checking it anymore if you know around when you ovulate in your cycle and just have sex every other day from the time your period finishes until you feel premenstrual symptoms. some women only have sex after their temperature goes up, and they miss the actual time of ovulation. so there is no reason to suspect you will have problems conceiving, and you do not need to be treated for this because it is a normal finding in many women. 80 percent of couples will conceive within a year. if you have been having sex at the right time and it's almost a year, it might be wise to have a gun exam and a hormonal evaluation, and also have your fiancé get his sperm count checked, as 50 percent of the time it can be a male factor. i hope i was able to answer your question and that my advice was helpful. best wishes and good luck with your pregnancy plans,"

a have a pain right below my left rib and if a breathe it makes a sharp pain in the spot that is already in pain ! .. it happens at random times and hurts really bad . a can to move or do anything but take really short and fast breathes . that is wrong with me ? thank you for your time .,1,52955,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. in the first trimester of pregnancy, your ovaries produce the hormone progesterone which normally is made by the placenta once it reaches adequate size. so it is not unusual in the first trimester pregnancy to feel pain in your ovaries. in addition, as your uterus stretches, you also may experience some cramping and pulling sensations, which can be on the sides. the only thing that is concerning is if you have not had an ultrasound this pregnancy to confirm that it is normal and located in your uterus. if you already have had an ultrasound for this pregnancy it is unlikely that there could be anything harmful going on, especially if you are not bleeding. so if the pain is severe enough that you cannot function, especially if you have not yet had an ultrasound, if you cannot reach her doctor within a reasonable amount of time, you may want to pursue care in an emergency setting. if you have had a normal ultrasound earlier in this pregnancy, you really do not need to worry, as your ovaries are normally examined as part of your pregnancy ultrasound and a large cyst would've already been detected. tylenol, or acetaminophen is safe to use for pain at the normal adult dosage during all trimesters of pregnancy, and you can try to see if that helps with the pain. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

"i . approx 20 years ago a suffered an injury to the left shoulder whist at the gym doing chest fly . about a month later whilst stretching , a suffered what a can only call a loud popping sound from my 5 rib on my sternum , again on the left side , which resulted in excruciating pain in the same location . a small indentation appeared about the size of a 50 cent piece and from that day on a have endured a feeling of not being able to get enough air . a constantly sigh trying to fresh but to no avail . please help",1,105897,"hi. to begin with, the treatment that your husband has undergone seems to be correct medically, more or less. to begin with he was suffering from locally advanced prostate cancer which was downstage and then surgically removed. however, he had a relapse of his disease in the bones and was placed on hormonal treatment. he seemed to be suffering from hormone resistant prostate cancer which can occur in 10% patients to start with. thus, he failed to respond to most of the treatments and eventually died of his disease. at every stage of progression, doing a scan is not mandatory. just a rising psa and symptoms are enough to know that the disease is progressing. doing a scan only documents that the disease has spread to a particular part. it will neither change the treatment nor the outcome. the blood was basically because of 2 reasons. one the disease in the lung which can commonly lead to bleeding on its own of varying quantity. added to that was the fact that he was in liver failure which further increases the chances of bleeding from any site. zynga has many side effects and one has to weigh the risks against the benefits and take a call. i assume, and you should to that the call to give zynga despite liver failure by your doctor was in good faith and based on sound judgement. i think the only part where your doctor failed you entirely was by not keeping you informed at every step the prognosis, the treatment options, the disease status and the likely outcome. it is something that i would have done and is nothing but unfortunate. while it would not have changed the outcome of your husband, it might have left you in peace after his demise. hope my answer takes care of your unrest in some measure, and you find strength enough to move on in life. take care"

"my daughter is diabetic . she had one of her toes amputated in march of this year . while in recovery she was given an injection of morphine . she became violently ill. this lasted the 5 days she was hospitalized and has continued until today . any beds she takes make her ill. about every 7 days she becomes violently ill again with vomiting and diarrhoea . she continues to gain weight and does , to ever have a good day . what test should she have run",1,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"well i have been taking birth control pills for over 10 months already . so now on this month i opened a new pack and forgot to take the first pill on this package.now its been like 2 or 3 weeks later my breast feel sore to the touch and a week before that started , a was cramping and felt bloated . a have been going to the bathroom frequently and my period is due in about 5-6 days . should a worry ?",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

i my son caught his ribs on the left side he reached down and banged his side .he a in pain and it really hurts when he breathes .he a been to see his doctor and he said just to take paracetamol and ibuprofen .is there anything you could suggest .thanking you .,1,104085,"! jacky i really appreciate your efforts for the treatment for your son, and you are not overreacting at all. from what you have said in question i can say from my clinical experience that your son is having some autistic features (as he strictly follows the same routine and throws tantrums when routine is changed). his mood swings might be related to such events as i can guess otherwise he would talk to you normally. you have not mentioned so, but such people are also strict about their dietary habits and may go to extremes patterns to follow it. the point which is against autism is that he developed this pattern just a year back and not from childhood. such features are also seen in a condition called ocd. you have said that he looks depressed, which can be seen in ocd (comorbid depression). you have mentioned mood fluctuations in which one side is that -- he gets angry and yells and screams, but the other side is not reflective of manic features, so, i donor think that he is bipolar. however, making a correct diagnosis the psychiatrist must interview the patient herself. one thing is definite that your son needs help and i'm sure that medicines will help him a lot, more than you may even think of. so, i would suggest that you must make a visit to a psychiatrist with him. when medicine will start showing effect his diet will also improve apart from his behavior, this will help in managing diabetes as well. you have asked if these symptoms are related to diabetes or not. well, i have not gone across any such research work till now where diabetes itself is a cause for such symptoms in any patient. so, it looks unlikely to be so. as you have mentioned that he had a breakup, which can be taken as a stressor, i think it might be related to his current condition to some extent. hope the reply is useful for feel free to ask more questions"

(as you said he has difficulty in walking now). you can also say to his parents that --- they can continue with all religious customs along with medicines, may be then they will agree... with medicine, he will start showing improvement in few days only... it is psychosis and patients will not agree to go to any doctor willingly, so you might need to take him forcefully. this is well accepted as it is for his benefit only. even if he doesn't agree for oral medicine there are injectables which are given to such patients... take the right step, take him to a doctor. hope the reply is useful feel free to ask more questions"

a have pericoronitis and had cause of antibiotics but my jaw is swollen and very painful . the antibiotics does not seem to work and the pain killers not strong enough . a feel the infection has spread to the mouth . a am going to have the wisdom tooth extracted but a can not do anything until the infection has gone please help in much pain,1,57293,"hi. welcome to chat doctor. as per your complaint it seems that you have inflammation of the gum flap surrounding the wisdom tooth and the condition is known as peritonitis. pericoronitis occurs if food gets lodged between wisdom tooth and the gum flap covering the wisdom tooth... and by food it does not mean that you see big food particles stuffed in there, but it also means uncleaned area and bacterial growth below gum flap... it leads to inflammation of the flap leading to pain swelling and as the area lies close to the throat there can be sore throat and swollen lymph nodes. but pain in the tooth in front of the wisdom tooth can be infection or decay in second molar tooth. the line of treatment is antibiotics, painkillers, mouthwash but only this is not enough to you, you should go to dentist again and ask him to irrigate the area between gum flap and wisdom tooth with saline, betadine solution and hy chat doctor. . other thing is done warm saline gargles, it will help you to reduce inflammation... carry on with the course of your antibiotics and painkillers, your pain and swelling must go in two three days. once you get relieved of your discomfort visit the dentist again and get an iop ar (x-ray) done to find out whether wisdom tooth will erupt to proper occlusion or is impacted (means having an obstruction and won't erupt to occlusion). if it is not impacted just get your gum flap removed known as operculectomy and if impacted get your tooth extracted... this will be your ultimate treatment and finish your problem forever. if the second molar tooth is also decayed leading to pain you can get root canal treatment done to save the tooth and resolve infection. hope you recover soon. thanks and regards."

my boyfriend and i been having unprotected sex were trying to have a baby together we been trying over 1 year now and we have been tested for any std a we had chlamydia but was treated for it back in march . a still get my period every month would could be wrong ?,1,108096,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. it is true that theoretically you should have been clear of the injection within three months of discontinuation, however many women after being a depo-provera for a long time do not resume having ovulatory, regular, menstrual cycles until 6 to 9 months or even up to a year after discontinuation. unfortunately, it is difficult to artificially induce ovulation in women who are coming off depo-provera. if you were not trying to become pregnant, your cycle could be regulated temporarily with birth control pills, but if you're actually trying to get pregnant the best thing you can do with this point is to just keep trying and wait and see. if you feel any symptoms of pregnancy, and you haven't gotten your period for a while, i would do pregnancy test just to make sure. there is always a possibility even if your periods are not regular that you do ovulate sometimes. so in summary, continue having unprotected sex every other to every three days and give it some more time. 80% of couples will conceive within one year, and if after a year of trying you and your partner are unsuccessful, it might be a good idea to see a fertility specialist for an evaluation. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes, and good luck getting pregnant,"

"by husband and a are trying to get pregnant . a have pcos . by period is due in 5 days . a have lower back pain , cramping and sore nipples . all which can be attributed to pms . a done wan a get my hopes up . by issue is a done know when or if a ovulate . when should a try to conceive ?",1,102111,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. when you have irregular menstrual cycles, it is difficult to pinpoint the time of ovulation each month. ovulation generally occurs about 14 days before your period starts. so if you count 2 weeks backwards from the date that your period starts, you can figure out by looking a few months back what your typical window of time is typical for your ovulation. if you have intercourse every other day from two days before your typical ovulation time until you either feel pms symptoms or your period comes, whichever comes first, there should be enough active sperm around when you typically ovulate for you to conceive. for more accurate estimation of your ovulation, there are kits called ovulation projectors that can be bought over-the-counter in a chemist or pharmacy. these kids have test strips for your urine that check for certain hormone that is released when you are about to ovulate. these test strips can also be useful if you do not have regular cycles when trying to conceive. if you and your partner try unsuccessfully for one year to get pregnant, there may be a medical reason involved in why you are not conceiving. at that point, you may want to consult with your gynecologist or fertility specialists. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was helpful. best wishes,"

hi .. i first started out having abdomen pain . stomach ache . then it progressed into my chest . i was diagnosed with hiatal hernia/gerd 4 yrs ago . now i tried everything antacids . my stomach pains has gone away but i still have a dull aching pain in center of my chest . egg was done at urgent care . they gave me some liquid stuff to drink but the aching pain came back its been going on now more than a week what should i do,1,69141,"any time an internal body part pushes into an area where it doesn't belong, it's called a hernia. the hiatus is an opening in the diaphragm -- the muscular wall separating the chest cavity from the abdomen. normally, the esophagus (food pipe) goes through the hiatus and attaches to the stomach. in a hiatal hernia (also called hiatus hernia) the stomach bulges up into the chest through that opening. there are two main types of hiatal hernias: sliding and para esophageal (next to the esophagus). many people with hiatal hernia have no symptoms, but others may have heartburn related to gastroesophageal reflux disease, or herd. although there appears to be a link, one condition does not seem to cause the other, because many people have a hiatal hernia without having herd, and others have herd without having a hiatal hernia. people with heartburn may experience chest pain that can easily be confused with the pain of a heart attack. that's why it's so important to undergo testing and get properly diagnosed. most people do not experience any symptoms of their hiatal hernia, so no treatment is necessary. however, the paraesophaeal hernia (when part of the stomach squeezes through the hiatus) can sometimes cause the stomach to be strangled, so surgery is sometimes recommended. other symptoms that may occur along with the hernia such as chest pain should be properly evaluated. symptoms of herd, such as heartburn, should be treated. u can try syrup machine gel 2 sf thrice daily before food for 7 days."

"a am on the second month of a new birth control , mononessa . missed last active pill of first months pack but did not allow the interval between the second to last pill of first months pack and first pill of second months pack to exceed 7 days . will a still be protected ?",1,7169,"hi, since you have missed the last two active pills, the pill free interval is more than 7 days. so there is a possibility of ovulation occurring, and you will not be completely protected by the pills. as you are already on the last white pill (inactive), start the new pack tomorrow. in addition, you should use an additional method of contraception like condom for the first seven days of the new pack, if you have intercourse. the other alternative will be not to have sex during the first 7 days of the new pack. in all probability you should be starting your periods in a day or two. i hope this helps hop"
"a am on the second month of a new birth control , mononessa . missed last active pill of first months pack but did not allow the interval between the second to last pill of first months pack and first pill of second months pack to exceed 7 days . will a still be protected ?",2,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"ave been suffering with swollen , bulging gums , pain in mouth for close to a year . most recently the tissue in the corners of my mouth running towards my nose are very visibly swollen . the tissue seems to be thickening and a also have many little bumps in upper and lower lips . ave seen many dentists and doctors without any results . pm concerned that it could be oral cancer but the doctors ave seen done think that the case . a had a it scan which should minor irritation of the sinuses . ave also been suffering from severe headaches or migraines and it all seems to be progressively worse . does anybody have suggestions as to what might be the problem ?",1,22667,"dear patient, i can understand your concern and feel sorry for the pain you are suffering from. you are informing me that when you got the upper molar extracted, the dentist told you that the bone between the sinus and tooth is destroyed and sinus cavity is open. roots of upper molar often are found inside the maxillary sinus, which causes opening of the sinus cavity while extraction of the tooth, creating an oro-antral fistula, that is a direct connection between oral cavity and sinus cavity. in this case, the food or water you take has chances of passing infection in the sinus through mouth and the infection does not resolve. it is mandatory to close this connection between mouth and the sinus. it could be done by the dentist by taking stitches in the area when he found that sinus has opened, but it can also be done now. however, as about 2 weeks has passed since extraction, the opening would not be as much clear as it would have been during extraction. a blood clot may have filled the area. so what you need to do now is, go to an oral surgeon or an ent specialist. i know you have insurance problem, but there seems no other solution to your problem. you might have to go for x-rays and probably ct scan of the area to diagnose if oro-antral fistula actually exists and if it does, you might have to go for a little surgery to close the communication between mouth and sinus followed by antibiotics to resolve the infection. i hope this information helps. thank you for choosing chat doctor. i wish you get well soon. best,"

my semen is not getting liquefaction.so what should i do to get liquefaction in time ? .last year my semen analysis report said everything is normal eventhough i am a diabetic.this time lab people say that my semen is not getting liquefaction.so what is the problem ?,1,69003,hellothanks for query. based on the report of semen analysis of your husband that you have posted i would like to make comments in comparison to who standards as detailed below .1) color is normal 2) viscosity is slightly viscous which is abnormal and may be due to clumping of the sperms together .3)liquefaction time is 3 hours. normal liquefaction time is 30 to 45 minutes. high liquefaction time suggests clumping of the sperms mostly due to infection which hampers free mobility of sperms 4)total sperm count of 38 millions (in 3 ml of semen) is also very low which in your case should be 120 millions .5)presence of 8-10 pus cells strongly suggests infection either in seminal vesicles or prostate and needs to be treated with antibiotics. other important parameters of semen like percentage of motility of sperms and morphology of the sperms are not mentioned in your report hence can not be commented on. chat doctor.

"key , a am a young male that recently turned 20 , my question is about facial hair , my facial hair seems to be growing slowly and a am just worried that , like a few people a know will only grow in certain patches and stop there , how old until my beard is fully grown , will acne prevent hair from growing on that spot , does acne cream stop hair growth because of the chemicals in it , do acne scars without a doubt mean a bald spot for my beard in that scar area . it what age should a expect full growth , also , a think a have noticed my beard growing slightly quicker when a exercise , this being from the raise in testosterone a assume right ? a know my questions are a little all over the place , a would really appreciate an answer to all of them",1,15410,"hi many, welcome and thanks for posting your query to chat doctor. so you are worried about the growth of facial hair (rather beards) in uniform manner. now to solve your queries:1. our growth in all manners continues till 25 years of life, so the new growth of facial hair on beard will also be growing till that time. it all depends on the family pattern and genes which we carry from our ancestors. so, basically it will be depending on your parents side.2. neither acne nor acne scars and creams prevent the growth of hair. none of the chemicals in acne creams are responsible to prevent hair growth in general. but if the scars are quite deep then at that localized area only you can have damage to hair root, overall is negligible unless you have deep scars all over face.3. yes due to exercise we do have a bit of increased metabolic rate leading to good hair growth. lastly there is no medical treatment in this world which can cause growth of hair in only beard area and your questions are exactly the same which a young man have (and even i had when i was at your age) so don't worry and be happy.with the best health and beard wishes, chat doctor."

( fyi-i was not overweight when this started 7 years ago ) .,2,82366,"hello friend, thank you for posting your query through chat doctor. i am a homeopath answering your query and the answer which i am going to give you may contain several thoughts which may appear strange or new for you. this i say because homeopathy is a new system of medicine and is almost unheard by the majority of the population. therefore, due to the high influence of the conventional medicine the people at large are brainwashed to believe and act according to the health education given by them. coming back to the fibroadenoma of your left breast in the year 1979, you had a psychological conflict in the mind level. you are a sensitive individual and that is why your left breast was affected. it must have been related with your child chat doctor. the sensitivity is genetic, and you reacted to the conflict through the brain according to a genetic programming. mind-brain - organ affection resulted in the development of a lump in your left breast in 1979. you consulted your gynecologist, and he suggested that it may turn to become cancerous in future and so it is better to remove it, and you subdued to his suggestion. actually the lump in the breast was an attempt of the body to cure you, or it was the result of a self defense mechanism. since you had not resolved the conflict in the psychological level, the lump remained there without getting resolved. but the body kept the lump protected in a cyst with minimum amount of inflammation called chronic cystitis. by removing the fibroadenoma or chronic cystic mastitis, you were not cured, but your lump in the breast was removed. in 1995 also you are the same person, you are the same sensitive person, and you underwent another more serious psychological conflict and the same left breast was again affected in a more serious manner. instead of recognizing the mass as a defense mechanism, you got the fear in you that you have cancer. the tissue changes also suggested that there is more serious pathology, and they labelled your lump this time as cancer and suggested removal of your left breast. if you could have recognized the lump as a defense mechanism and if you had no fear of cancer, you could have retained your breast. but the fear of cancer is such that it is associated with death and so you lost your breast. in no case, either by removal of lump in 1979 or by removal of your breast in 1995, you are not cured only your disease is cured. hope by this time you have got the answer for your query. both are related to each other because they are in the same individual, same sensitivity, same program. homeopathy cures the person and once the individual is cured all his diseases will be cured. with best wishes,"

"hi , my 7yr daughter was complaining abdominal pain from last 2 week .doctor suggested her protein sep for pain but its not worked then i started metal sep . is it safe for her and how long i can give it to her.her ultrasound reports are normal . pls.tell what are the other possibilities of this pain . .",1,62948,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. it is doubtful that your daughters symptoms are due to a gallbladder problem, since the gallbladder is on the right side of the upper abdomen, and usually the gallbladder only feels pain after eating.however, there are many other causes of left abdominal pain, such as gastritis, a stomach flu, kidney stones... and if it is lower abdominal pain, it can be related to the uterus or ovaries. her anxiety about the situation probably is also contributing to the problem. so if your daughter is in so much distress she should call her doctor. there is someone on duty for emergencies even at night for most ob practices. her doctor can make a recommendation of whether to go to the emergency room or come in for a doctor's appointment. either way, as this problem has been going on for a few days, she absolutely should be seen by a doctor soon to make a diagnosis. i hope this answer and my advice was helpful. best wishes to your daughter for the rest of her pregnancy,"

"okay , i had the implanon implant , the date went out a month before i went to the doctor . they didst give me a pregnancy test , but they did insert the nexplanon . a be been having pregnancy symptoms , maybe it a just in my head , i do have a 3 year old , so i have been through it before . it does have me worried that in having all the symptoms . is it likely that you can get pregnant while getting off birth control , changing to a new one ?",1,77098,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. many women who have been on birth control for many years can develop a tolerance of sorts for the pills' ability to control your menstrual cycle, especially after they have not menstruated for a long time due to pregnancy or another cause. this can also occur to the fact that you did relatively recently give birth, especially if you were breastfeeding. bleeding when you are not supposed to have your period on the pill is called breakthrough bleeding. it does not mean the pill is ineffective as a contraceptive, but having some irregular bleeding in between periods or a different bleeding pattern that you may have had before the pregnancy is not unusual. having heavy bleeding in the morning is likely due to the blood accumulating in your vagina during the night, and then it all comes out at once when you get out of bed due to gravity. your cycle may get back to normal after a few more months on the pill, and taking it as close to the same time every day will help to reduce the risk of breakthrough bleeding. if it continues for more than 3 months, you may benefit from changing your birth control brand to one with a slightly higher dose of estrogen, as the estrogen in the pill is the ingredient that controls your menstrual cycle. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"year or , pm shape , want to get pregnant , the problem is my husband having esbl ureter track infection . i done know whether all conceive it or not . today is my 25th day , last period was 15th nov. plus advise , what is the time takes for get the result ?",1,12366,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, i want to reassure you that it commonly can take up to a year from healthy couples to conceive. you are not diagnosed as infertile unless you and your husband have been trying to conceive (which means having unprotected intercourse at least two or three days a week) for at least a year. folic acid is a b vitamin that does not help you to get pregnant, however it is recommended to take during early pregnancy because it helps prevent birth defects. siphene, also known as camphene citrate, is a fertility medication. it can help induce ovulation in women who are infertile because they do not ovulate. however, if your periods normally come every month, there is no reason to suspect that you are not ovulating. because you are under the age of 35, i recommend that you and your husband to not take any more fertility medications and try to conceive for another six months on your own. normally, your most fertile time is between the time your period stops until you start to feel premenstrual symptoms. for most couples, that means having sex every other day from about the seventh day of your cycle until the 23rd to 25th day. if you and your husband have not conceived in another six months, i recommend both of you see fertility specialist, as 50% of the time lack of pregnancy can be a problem with the men sperm as well. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful, and you and your husband are able to have a baby soon. best wishes,"

i i had a sexual experience today with my boyfriend and in not sure if i was fertile or ovulating at all . it has been at least a week after my last period . we didst have sex but i did get sperm in my fingers and inserted it into my vagina . can i get pregnant ? what are my chances,1,37527,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. even though your boyfriends penis was inside you for only a short time, sperm can be present in pre-ejaculate (or pre-cum) and if you truly do not want to become pregnant it is really important to avoid any contact of the penis with your vagina during sexual play. the most fertile time of a woman cycle is in the middle, typically 14 days before your menstrual period would be due. so the time from when your period finishes until you start to feel pms symptoms is your fertile time. so in this case, since your boyfriend did not ejaculate, it still would be quite rare for you to have conceived. the most common sign of pregnancy is a late or delayed menstrual period. so in your case, you just need to wait for your period to arrive, and if it is late, you can do an over-the-counter urine pregnancy test which is greater than 99% accurate. pregnancy test do not become positive however until at least 2 to 3 weeks after conception. so in summary, your chances of having gotten pregnant in your particular situation is very, very low. for the future, please make sure that the penis is completely covered with a condom if it has any contact with the opening of your vagina. as long as the area is moist, sperm can swim all the way up your vagina from the opening and result in pregnancy. however, the amount of sperm in pre-cum is extremely low, so again i doubt that you need to be concerned about this one sexual encounter. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was helpful. best wishes,"

i i had a sexual experience today with my boyfriend and in not sure if i was fertile or ovulating at all . it has been at least a week after my last period . we didst have sex but i did get sperm in my fingers and inserted it into my vagina . can i get pregnant ? what are my chances,3,77227,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, i want to clarify, if you are virgin and have not had sexual intercourse or ejaculation directly in the opening of your vagina, your chance of pregnancy is really nonexistent. sperm die when exposed to air, so there is no way that you can become pregnant from sperm that ejaculated outside the vagina. furthermore, is very uncommon to find women who ovulate during their menstrual cycle. therefore, you were most likely not at the fertile time of your cycle when you and your boyfriend had genital contact. furthermore, irregular bleeding can be caused by travel, changes in weight, hormonal imbalances and stress, especially the stress of worrying about getting pregnant. just because your period was light this month does not mean that there was anything wrong. now omens menstrual cycle is exactly the same every month, and as long as you got a period at the usual time, there is no reason to suspect pregnancy if the bleeding was different in quality than what you usually see. so i think that it is fine to be reassured that you did not conceive from this encounter with your boyfriend. if you continue to have irregular menstrual cycles for more than three months, you may want to visit your local physician as some hormonal imbalances can cause these problems and should be tested for. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was reassuring. best wishes,"

a had some stitches in my scalp about 8 days ago . will be removing them in about 3 more days but there is still a pinkish oozing coming from the wound . a think is is a dime sized area that was to stitched but the skin has to grown back yet . will this eventually go away . chris,1,83155,"hi, thanks for writing in. it is important to know if there is any infection in the area of stitches. if there is an infection then it must be treated first and then the wound healing will progress. by 6 weeks the stitches should have started healing. the time for complete healing of surgical wound is approximately 12 weeks. however since you have an open wound therefore first this wound must be cleaned and resutured. this will permit healing of the skin layers by first intention and progress to normal healing over the next few weeks. since there is a lemon sized hole in your abdomen therefore it must be repaired by putting additional sutures in the area. please discuss the open wound in detail with your doctor and when he is likely to close it. healing is not possible with a persisting open wound. please do not worry."

by daughter is 8 1/2 weeks pregnant but cant keep nothing down ... the is on 3 different nausea pills and plus went to hospital and got fluids because she was dehydrated .. that do you suggest ? ? ? ? ? be have tried everything a can possibly think of ..,2,58987,"his am chat doctor. i have read your message. i think i can help you. first, a package test means that multiple tests are included that correlate to the test. cpk and spe can both be package tests as there are many related tests needed in a diagnosis. the symptoms that you seem to be facing as per the query is basically severe backache that increases on lying down or bending-in other words, anything that causes the spine to be under pressure. now she itself can cause the symptoms. the muscles and bone problems can arise in she itself and thus possibly one will feel that there is nothing more to do. however, in many situations, the doctors may get biased my a diagnosis. so, i think it is good that your doctor did not get biased with your pre-existing diagnosis of she and continued to look for other causes of backache. a severe backache can happen due to muscle disorders, a condition known as myopathy. the cause of myopathy may be she itself. the test commonly done to test myopathy is cpk or creatine phospholipase. this is a test done from blood. the idea is if the cpk is raised, it suggests myopathy. in this situation, your doctor will need to modify the therapy. i am unaware of your medication from the query. so i cannot really comment upon it. but some medicines themselves cause myopathy. and sometimes, the dose of existing medicines need to be stepped up for treatment of myopathy. so i presume your doctor wanted to check that. second test was spe or serum protein electrophoresis. this is one of the tests for multiple myeloma. this is a type of malignancy that affects the bones and causes bone pains and should be ruled out in middle-aged to elderly commonly if the backache is worsening and is specially bad when lying down. if the test is negative, there is nothing to worry about. if it does come out to be positive, multiple myeloma can be treated. so again you need not worry since the treatment is available. why the doctor did not tell you about the tests is something i can only speculate about. i guess it was because these are just doubts, considering you already have she- in medicine, the usual dictum is that one disease can explain the symptom, the other condition should not be sought. having said that, it's a folly to miss another diagnosis due to a pre-existing condition. i think he would have told you if the tests came out positive. so there should be nothing to worry about-the doctor was just making sure that there is no other problem. possibly since there was nothing else diagnosed, he did not tell you about it. i have tried to make it as simple as possible to understand the situation. in case there are still doubts, feel free to contact me for further details. best of luck,"

"a had recent test to see if my treatment for sep a was successful . today a received a message saying my test were remarkable and to complete the test again in 6 months . not wanting to assume anything , does this mean the treatment seems to have worked ?",1,15745,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. first, if you are late for your shot and have had unprotected sex, even if you are bleeding, you should do a urine pregnancy test. if your pregnancy test is negative, many women do not have regular periods come back after discontinuing the depo-provera injection for even up to 6 months. this, however, does not mean that you cannot become pregnant. if you are not actively trying to get pregnant, a good way to help regulate your cycles until your own body resumes a regular cycle is by taking birth control pills. birth control pills make you get a light, regular, predictable cycle every month and will help control breakthrough bleeding (the brown staining you have all the time). many women have irregular bleeding in the first 6 months to a year of using the shot, and unfortunately the same thing can happen after you discontinue it. so, in summary, all the irregular bleeding you are having is likely due to your discontinuing the demo shot. if you need contraception, the monthly cycle birth control pill would be a good option that can also help you have regular cycles. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"
"a had recent test to see if my treatment for sep a was successful . today a received a message saying my test were remarkable and to complete the test again in 6 months . not wanting to assume anything , does this mean the treatment seems to have worked ?",2,35396,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. if you have not yet missed your period, even if you are pregnant, the line will appear very faint on the pregnancy test as your hormone levels are extremely low at this time in pregnancy. so there is no reason to assume that the test was wrong as the greatest likelihood is that you are actually pregnant. however, women can have a situation where they have a positive pregnancy test and then get their normal period on time. this is known as a chemical pregnancy and is caused by the situation where the egg is fertilized but never implants into the uterus and continues to grow. so i encourage patients in general to try to avoid performing pregnancy test before they actually miss their period, as even though you have a positive pregnancy test this early, it does not guarantee that the pregnancy is going to take. if your cycle is late, there is no reason to assume that there is any problem with the pregnancy. if you do retest after you miss your period and the line is still very weekly positive, it may be reasonable to see a physician and get a blood test for the level of your pregnancy hormone. pregnancy hormone levels are supposed to double every 48 hours so by the time you miss your period the levels should be significantly high enough to produce a clear double line on the pregnancy test especially if you perform it with your first morning urine as recommended. low hormone levels in early pregnancy can indicate that the pregnancy is not developing properly or that it can be an ectopic or tubal pregnancy, which needs to be diagnosed and accurately managed by a physician. in the meantime however, i encourage you to stop chat doctor. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes and good luck with the pregnancy,"

a am having slight cramps and a am not due for my period for 7 more days . this is my third month of being on tri-previfem birth control . by boyfriend and a have had sex without a condom ( he didst ejaculate in me ) but a always take my pills on time and never forget them . is there a possibility a could be pregnant ?,1,27194,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. tri-sprintec is a birth control pill that has a traffic regimen; which means that each color pill in the package has a slightly different dose of hormones. occasionally, women who take traffic pills may have some spotting in the first few days after each pill strength changes over the course of the month. this may cause some slight bleeding or spotting when were not supposed to have your period. whenever you had vaginal bleeding, regardless of the cause, usually there is some cramping that accompanies it. furthermore, it is not unusual to have irregular bleeding or spotting in the first 3 months of pill use. both sprinter and tri-sprintec are considered low-dose birth control pills, however there are many brands on the market that have a lower dose of estrogen than the pill you are currently taking. so you may have less irregular bleeding and spotting on a different kind of monophasic (same dose all month) birth control pill. regarding pregnancy, the chance of your conceiving while taking birth control pills and using a condom is basically nonexistent. so i believe the symptoms you were experiencing are side effects due to the new birth control pill. if your desire is for lighter, regular periods, a different brand of monophasic pill may work better for you with fewer side effects. i hope i was able to adequately answer questions today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

a think a was misdiagnosed with of . a was later diagnosed with games disease based on a blood test sent to a specially lab . this diagnosis came after 10+ yrs . of my of diagnosis . is there still a possibility of the games being treated and close to being cured ?,1,72978,"hi ! good morning. i am chat doctor answering your query. i am not aware if an intestinal mucosa biopsy was done during the endoscopy and colonoscopy or not, which was a must. if done, you did not mention the report of the biopsy. when all the tests mentioned by you came out to be normal, this compels me to think of possibility of celiac disease/gluten sensitivity which goes very often unsuspected and missed, specially if your daughter was used to eat fried, oily, and fast food from outside. this is not easy to diagnose, and the best way is to exclude all kinds of fast food you consume in outside eating joints. gluten sensitivity could give rise to all the symptoms you have described including your weight loss, abdominal pain, nausea, and over and above, low platelet count which might have resulted in the bruises. a platelet count and clotting profile is indicated in this case. it is usually not thought of and is under diagnosed. also, if you are from a developing country, tuberculosis not infrequently could give rise to such symptoms of your daughter. i suggest you to consult a gastroenterologist along with a dietician on this aspect of the diagnosis, which possibly might not have been considered until now. the gastroenterologist will be able to diagnose with few biochemical tests along with a possible repeat endoscopy with biopsy of the intestinal mucosal wall, while the dietician can guide you on your daughters' food that she can consume pleasantly. i hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts. thanks for choosing chat doctor to clear doubts on your health problems. i wish you an early recovery. chat doctor."

"a am concerned because my daughter is having symptoms of gall bladder problems , however a noticed that it stated you could become sick 2 to 3 hours after a meal but she is getting sick as soon as she finishes eating . this evening she had pizza and had no more finished her second piece when she started feeling bad and went to the bathroom and vomited . twice it has been when eating pizza and the 3rd time was eating a fatty food . this has hit within the last two weeks , could the vomiting hit her that fast ?",1,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

so for birth control in on the shot . after 3 months i was suppose to get another shot but i never went . so i got my period and i figured by me missing the next shot that caused me to get it . i had my period for like a few weeks . then it went away for a few days . i had unprotected sex and the next day i got my period again . even when i done have my period in constantly bleeding like brown stuff . i done think i could be pregnant but in just not too sure . or if in having all of this happen due to the fact that i missed my next birth control shot . can you help me figure out what could be wrong please ? ? ? ?,1,15745,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. first, if you are late for your shot and have had unprotected sex, even if you are bleeding, you should do a urine pregnancy test. if your pregnancy test is negative, many women do not have regular periods come back after discontinuing the depo-provera injection for even up to 6 months. this, however, does not mean that you cannot become pregnant. if you are not actively trying to get pregnant, a good way to help regulate your cycles until your own body resumes a regular cycle is by taking birth control pills. birth control pills make you get a light, regular, predictable cycle every month and will help control breakthrough bleeding (the brown staining you have all the time). many women have irregular bleeding in the first 6 months to a year of using the shot, and unfortunately the same thing can happen after you discontinue it. so, in summary, all the irregular bleeding you are having is likely due to your discontinuing the demo shot. if you need contraception, the monthly cycle birth control pill would be a good option that can also help you have regular cycles. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"i , to a have a really strange question hama . to like 2 mind after a took my birth control a burped and regurgitated and something yellow came up so a spit it into the sink and washed it down , after a thought about it a realized it was most likely my birth control pill a little mushy from just being swallowed , so hmm what do a do ? a",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"hello , my wife has a pain on the lower part of her right shoulder blade . the pain started about 10 days ago and now is accompanied with a cough and congestion . hes not siting pink mucus . the pain is worse at night and hot applications or ben-gay are not helping . please , advice .",3,50884,"here you have given symptoms of left chest tightness, pain in left shoulder blade along with lower armpit and biceps. as per your symptoms there are a couple of possibilities. if you have chest congestion and chest discomfort then it can be related to lungs and i suggest taking x-ray and check properly for any sort of lung issue or chest infection. if there is no chest congestion and its only tightness of left side chest then it can also be related to cardiac issue. i suggest visiting cardiologist do your ecg along with treadmill test to evaluate further. if there is no issue at lung and heart level then it is muscular pain only at left shoulder blade which is radiating to left side chest as well as armpit level. but this pain can also be indication of problem at cervical spine like loss of cervical curve or disc related issues. however for this i suggest visiting orthopedic doctor and get yourself evaluated properly and take treatment as per that. here i suggest do visit a physio for further treatment planning as per orthopedic suggestion because physiotherapy treatment will help you to overcome the pain as well physiotherapy exercises will help you to improve the biomechanics of cervical spine, shoulder blade as well shoulder joint which will further help you to have long term relief. you can also use hot pack at home for some more pain relief. and do apply some pain reliving ointment after the use of hot pack. i am sure this will be helpful for you if you use it properly and follow the suggestion. take care."

"pm 25 years old . by boyfriend and a were rough housing and he kneed me in my left breast . it was sore last night but this morning it is sensitive to the touch . the spot is right beside were my arm pit starts , and both breasts are now hurting me . by nipples are also sensitive as well . does this drama mean a could have the potential of getting breast cancer ?",1,82366,"hello friend, thank you for posting your query through chat doctor. i am a homeopath answering your query and the answer which i am going to give you may contain several thoughts which may appear strange or new for you. this i say because homeopathy is a new system of medicine and is almost unheard by the majority of the population. therefore, due to the high influence of the conventional medicine the people at large are brainwashed to believe and act according to the health education given by them. coming back to the fibroadenoma of your left breast in the year 1979, you had a psychological conflict in the mind level. you are a sensitive individual and that is why your left breast was affected. it must have been related with your child chat doctor. the sensitivity is genetic, and you reacted to the conflict through the brain according to a genetic programming. mind-brain - organ affection resulted in the development of a lump in your left breast in 1979. you consulted your gynecologist, and he suggested that it may turn to become cancerous in future and so it is better to remove it, and you subdued to his suggestion. actually the lump in the breast was an attempt of the body to cure you, or it was the result of a self defense mechanism. since you had not resolved the conflict in the psychological level, the lump remained there without getting resolved. but the body kept the lump protected in a cyst with minimum amount of inflammation called chronic cystitis. by removing the fibroadenoma or chronic cystic mastitis, you were not cured, but your lump in the breast was removed. in 1995 also you are the same person, you are the same sensitive person, and you underwent another more serious psychological conflict and the same left breast was again affected in a more serious manner. instead of recognizing the mass as a defense mechanism, you got the fear in you that you have cancer. the tissue changes also suggested that there is more serious pathology, and they labelled your lump this time as cancer and suggested removal of your left breast. if you could have recognized the lump as a defense mechanism and if you had no fear of cancer, you could have retained your breast. but the fear of cancer is such that it is associated with death and so you lost your breast. in no case, either by removal of lump in 1979 or by removal of your breast in 1995, you are not cured only your disease is cured. hope by this time you have got the answer for your query. both are related to each other because they are in the same individual, same sensitivity, same program. homeopathy cures the person and once the individual is cured all his diseases will be cured. with best wishes,"

"management of asymptomatic polyhydraminios . by wife is 25 weeks pregnant and doctor said that the amniotic fluid is more than normal , therefore we would like to know whether it will make any problem for baby or the mother and it occurred due to any other reasons . diabetes test is not yet done . be really appreciate you if you could advise us on this matter .",1,92797,"hi there, the echogenic bowel and echogenic loci in heart make you at a slightly increased risk of having a baby with downs syn chat doctor. you need to take a call about the amniocentesis, which will tell us if you definitely are carrying a genetically abnormal baby or not. this could help us a lot in managing the rest of the pregnancy. also, the echogenic bowel could be due to certain fetal infections which also could be tested in the amniotic fluid. usually a small amount of amniotic fluid is removed about 20 ml for these diagnostic purposes and these should not cause any problems with placental bleeding or separation. placental abruption or separation or bleeding is seen in amniocentesis done in the later months later 28 weeks or so. moreover, placental abruption is a diagnosis of later pregnancy, i would not label a collection behind the placenta at 20 weeks as abruption. every amniocentesis has a miscarriage risk of 1%, that is 1 in 100 women who undergo amniocentesis have a miscarriage, this has to be kept in mind before undergoing the procedure. it would be advisable for you to undergo amniocentesis as the cause for echogenic bowel needs to be ascertained. echogenic bowel seen in babies have a risk of having babies who are small for the gestational age and require monitoring for the rest of the pregnancy even if the results of amniocentesis is normal. hope this helps. regards."

to when i was 3 i was diagnosed with growth hormone deficiency and i took daily shots in my stomach until i was 14 and my doctor said if i didst get my period by 16 i have to go back and see whats wrong . i am 16 and still no period . so i was wondering what could be wrong ? what tests they will run ? if it will be awkward ? if its normal ? a know just so in not freaked out about this ! is .. i really done like going to my doctor . its a guy and i just think its awkward talking about period stuff .,1,35396,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. if you have not yet missed your period, even if you are pregnant, the line will appear very faint on the pregnancy test as your hormone levels are extremely low at this time in pregnancy. so there is no reason to assume that the test was wrong as the greatest likelihood is that you are actually pregnant. however, women can have a situation where they have a positive pregnancy test and then get their normal period on time. this is known as a chemical pregnancy and is caused by the situation where the egg is fertilized but never implants into the uterus and continues to grow. so i encourage patients in general to try to avoid performing pregnancy test before they actually miss their period, as even though you have a positive pregnancy test this early, it does not guarantee that the pregnancy is going to take. if your cycle is late, there is no reason to assume that there is any problem with the pregnancy. if you do retest after you miss your period and the line is still very weekly positive, it may be reasonable to see a physician and get a blood test for the level of your pregnancy hormone. pregnancy hormone levels are supposed to double every 48 hours so by the time you miss your period the levels should be significantly high enough to produce a clear double line on the pregnancy test especially if you perform it with your first morning urine as recommended. low hormone levels in early pregnancy can indicate that the pregnancy is not developing properly or that it can be an ectopic or tubal pregnancy, which needs to be diagnosed and accurately managed by a physician. in the meantime however, i encourage you to stop chat doctor. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes and good luck with the pregnancy,"

hi i masturbate sometimes every night and when i ejaculate most of it went up to my mouth as i was laying down at the time plus i ejaculate quite alot.and i sort of swallowed it and it tasted quite nice so i tasted some more and swallowed it.can it do any harm if i swallow my own semen .. thanks,1,64560,"hi, it's possible that your mothers coughing fits account to be normal, since it was a chat doctor. i would advise giving her only semisolid food that will be easy on her food pipe and her gut since she is prone to hemorrhoids. it will be easier for her to swallow and digest if the food is more soft and watery. her age is the reason her gastrointestinal tract must be narrowing, hence sometimes when swallowed too fast, food can go to the wrong pipe(viz air pipe), causing a coughing impulse, since the epiglottis is sensitive, and it responds to touch by a cough impulse. hence, i would say it is nothing to worry about, when she gets this coughing spell out her in a position where she can cough out everything she swallowed since it is necessary to avoid aspirating food. after the spell, and only after the spell has subsided, and she has thrown out all food, and she is in her senses, give her a glass of water that she can slowly sip n swallow, which will ease the healing. take care. good to know you care for your mother."

"is it the semen that smells after intercourse with my girlfriend , because i have had surgery so i have no sperm . however , she is paranoid and wont let me release in her . her gino a few years ago said it was the semen , created a problem . however i have only pulled out in our 6 month relationship",1,79191,"hello and i hope i can help you today. chlamydia is the most common asymptomatic sexually-transmitted disease in young adults. the great majority of people who have chlamydia have no symptoms at all. normally, it is recommended that if you have a previous partner who is diagnosed with chlamydia that you undergo treatment because having the infection even without symptoms is so common. so your new girlfriend is probably right that you were the one who spread chlamydia to her. of course this is not your fault, as you did not know that you carry the infection. however, in order to cure both your current girlfriend and you is recommended that you both have treatment at the same time, so you cannot spread it back and forth to each other. even if you get tested, and it is negative, there are a significant number of false negative tests, so it is still recommended that you both be treated. your girlfriends' obstetrician, at least in the united states, is allowed to write you a prescription for the correct medication. i suggest you attend one of her prenatal appointments with her so that possibly you could both take the medication at that visit at the same time if they have it available. so in summary, most people, both men and women, have no symptoms when they have chlamydia. during pregnancy, it is routinely tested because chlamydia and a pregnant woman at delivery can cause eye infections in the baby. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"a just had four lower dental implants and temporary bridge . a have no permanent lower teeth , they were all removed . the problem is my tongue is now larger than the teeth space and a keep biting my tongue and lip . will my tongue eventually get smaller and fit into the space and normal chewing then resume ?",1,17824,"tongue biting and cheek biting can occur because of stress or anxiety or can occur unconsciously. some sharp tooth or some missing tooth can also lead to tongue biting and cheek biting. tongue in cheek biting is a deleterious habit and can lead to irritation and also increases the incidence of canker sores. tongue biting can also cause bleeding on tongue. you need to make a self-conscious effort to stop this habit of tongue biting. if there are any sharp teeth or missing teeth or your bite is not correct, then you need to consult a dentist. your dentist can correct the sharp teeth if present. if there is some missing tooth present, then get them replaced. if bite is not correct, then you can get braces treatment or invitations done to correct the bite. chewing sugar-free gums may provide some help. if bleeding occurs on tongue biting, then you can keep a piece of ice or ice-cold water on it and can use an antimicrobial mouth wash to reduce chances of infection."
