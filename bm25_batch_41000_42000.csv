"my daughter is 18months old and she often vomits after eating the food , its immediately happens ? is she suffering with acid flux ? its happening since she turned her 7th month , she does not chew her food even she got 5front lower and 4upeers and two molar teeth",1,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"a have a question about my mental health.when a was little , a had voices , like people screaming , shouting , and rasping voices whispering at me . it doesn't happen during the day anymore . just in dreams . but now a have music in my head . it plays loudly , and the music a have never heard before . it doesn't cause me problems , but a thought a should ask . sometimes a cant hear myself thinking .",1,15522,"hello, welcome to chat doctor. thanks for posting your question at this forum. we understand your concern. i am chat doctor psychiatry from india. i will guide you about your daughters' health. whatever information you have given here about your daughter, point towards a serious long-lasting mental illness of psychosis like schizophrenia. i must explain you in simpler way. schizophrenia is a psychotic illness in which the person has abnormal perception, absurd thinking, decline of higher mental function, deterioration in social and occupational functioning and significant personal sufferings for years. the patient may claim to hear unusual voices which others deny hearing. this is called auditory hallucination. initially the voices come for a short period and the person feels strange and does not understand what to do. he/ she gradually may start believing on those voices as frequency and intensity of voices increases with passage of time. often these voices comment/discuss derogatory about the person and sometimes these may suggest or command the person to do certain act. sometimes the person may harm herself/ himself sunder the influence of these voices. as you have experienced, she has a self-talking behavior since last many years, has harmed herself once and now she is claiming a clear two-way conversation with that voice. it appears that she is having auditory hallucination(auditory hallucination is one of the commonest symptoms in psychosis like schizophrenia), and apparently these voices are unpleasant or commanding in nature that might have provoked the episode of self harm in the past. since the onset of symptoms is in childhood and has been continuing for years it shows poor awareness of caregiver about the symptoms of illness. it is never too late. you must consult a good child and adolescent psychiatrist and encourage your daughter to discuss her symptoms honestly so that the diagnosis can be finalized. if i had been her doctor, i would have advice her for brain imaging, certain other investigations, to take some antipsychotic medicines under supervision of a family member and to attend psycho-educative classes regularly. medicines and supportive therapy can bring remission to illness. hope this has helped you. i wish you all the best."

"i my name is path , i have inoperable pancreatic cancer , diagnosed 18 months ago , a week ago i had a stent fitted into my bile duct to relieve the yellowing of my skin , very dark urine and grey fatty stools , before i had the stent fitted i didst suffer too much pain and could eat pretty well , since the stent was fitted i suffer constant pain and discomfort , and diaries , nausea , is this pretty normal till everything settles ?",1,81321,"hi, thanks for writing in. cancer is a difficult condition to treat, but one should fight it till the end. bile duct cancers are very aggressive and can quickly spread over the involved area. the bile duct conveys the bile generated in the liver to the small intestine through the bile duct. this bile secreted in to the intestine helps in digestion of food. the cancer in bile duct might have caused obstruction to flow of bile and therefore there was jaundice. it is important to know if the entire affected area was removed by surgery and confirmed to be cancer. the stent in place is allowing the bile to pass through without any obstruction and this is reducing the jaundice. if she has not developed cancer anywhere else in the body then she can continue having the stent in place. most likely every gall bladder and bile duct cancer might spread to the liver and that is seen on ultrasound scan or ct scan. once this is done then the survival of a patient is around 6 months to 18 months. if there is no spread to the liver than a patient with a bile duct cancer which has been operated can survive for 2 years."

"a a in the fourth week of have a cold/flu . in this illness it includes much coughing . the strange thing is , a week ago a began dealing with horrible side cramps . a was wondering does a tremendous amount of consistent coughing create a type of fatigue that allows side cramps ?",2,30579,"hi ! your flu and the diarrhea with abdominal cramps may or may not be related. in case of child chat doctor. the first diagnosis comes to the mind is a food poisoning. possibly you did not receive proper complete treatment for it and this led to more severe cramps in your abdomen. you did not mention anything about fever. if it was there, then it goes more in favor of infection in the intestines. there is no harm in taking antacid and antiflatulents, but i am not in favor of your taking enema. after any loose motions, it is but natural that the bowel becomes empty, and it takes time for the bowel to get loaded with fecal matter to get the urge of passing stool again. also, without knowing the exact cause of the cramps in your abdomen which could be any surgical cause like diverticulitis, one should not opt for an anemia. it is difficult to tell whether the swelling on the left side of your lower abdomen is due simple inflammation with mass formation or a leaking diverticulitis precipitated by self enema by yourself. in my opinion, you should consult at your earliest a general surgeon, who may advise some routine investigations for you apart from going for an ultrasound / ct scan depending on the initial examination findings. one more possibility of the swelling is left sided inguinal hernia, but your history does not go much in favor of it. anyways i think it is time for you to see your general surgeon and seek his advice. good luck."

"hi , i have pcs and i was wondering do you ovulate with every period because i have a period every month , i have known i have had this condition for four years and in that time i have only missed at the most 6 periods , does this mean i have a good chance at getting pregnant naturally ?",1,77227,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, i want to clarify, if you are virgin and have not had sexual intercourse or ejaculation directly in the opening of your vagina, your chance of pregnancy is really nonexistent. sperm die when exposed to air, so there is no way that you can become pregnant from sperm that ejaculated outside the vagina. furthermore, is very uncommon to find women who ovulate during their menstrual cycle. therefore, you were most likely not at the fertile time of your cycle when you and your boyfriend had genital contact. furthermore, irregular bleeding can be caused by travel, changes in weight, hormonal imbalances and stress, especially the stress of worrying about getting pregnant. just because your period was light this month does not mean that there was anything wrong. now omens menstrual cycle is exactly the same every month, and as long as you got a period at the usual time, there is no reason to suspect pregnancy if the bleeding was different in quality than what you usually see. so i think that it is fine to be reassured that you did not conceive from this encounter with your boyfriend. if you continue to have irregular menstrual cycles for more than three months, you may want to visit your local physician as some hormonal imbalances can cause these problems and should be tested for. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was reassuring. best wishes,"

i me and my girlfriend were fooling around last month 29 of september . to penetration just rubbing . the had her period last month on the first week of september . and this 2nd week of august her period must supposed to come . that are the chances of pregnancy ? here both freaking out . be cant sleep properly .,1,72620,"hallow dear, the duration of pregnancy when counted from the last menstrual period is 280 days or 9 calendar months and 7 days. in fact the egg is released (ovulation) 14 days prior to the next expected menses; i.e. if the cycle is of 30 days the egg will be released on day 16 of the cycle. the egg has 24 hours life while the sperms are active for 72 hours. hence, the conception can happen about a week around the day of ovulation. considering this, for practical purpose we consider 2 weeks less from the day of ovulation (or conception). so the pregnancy precisely is of 266 days. however, for the sake of convenience, we calculate it as 280 days from the last menstrual period date. considering these facts, if the delivery date is to be expected on september 30, the last menstrual period date should be 23 december. (would you be having it then?) now your cycle is of 30 days period. so the expected date of ovulation should be 07 january. hence, if the conception takes place on 07 january, the due date of delivery would be 30 september. the hitch here is that you should have ovulation taking lace on 07 january. moreover, we have noticed that all the pregnancies do not last for 280 days. the delivery can take place any time between 3 weeks earlier to 1 week later than the expected due date of delivery. keeping these facts and calculations in mind, you may plan your sexual relations accordingly. i hope this will help you."

"my son aged 5 has leg pain that comes and goes , a limp comes and goes . a lump always comes in the same place , he is always covered in bruises on his legs ( most times they are a ready color ) . he is pigeon toed ( been to podiatrist , they gave inserts for shoes and said could be due to knees )",1,5481,"hi there, im sorry to hear about the medical problems your father is having. when i hear the symptoms that your father is having, the first thing that comes to my mind is claudication. claudication is pain while walking due to arterial insufficiency- basically, the muscles in the legs don't get enough blood flow when they are being used, and they start to ache. this is caused by peripheral vascular disease and is common in smokers, diabetics, and patients with high cholesterol levels. these patients will often have a history of coronary artery disease and sometimes renal problems as well. the first thing i would recommend is for your father to start a waking regiment and walk consistently every day. he should aim to walk for about 30 minutes a day. if he cants do 30 minutes, he should do as much as he can, and then try to do a little more each day. the most important thing is daily consistency - he has to do it every day, not just one or two times a week. i'd also recommend he check his cholesterol levels, and if they are high a statin such as lipitor (atorvastatin) can help lower his levels and prevent further damage. finally, if he continues to have problems with walking after 6 months of a dedicated walking problem, then he should see a vascular surgeon and have his arterial vessels looked at in his leg with ultrasound. i hope this is helpful. please contact me with any questions."

(would you be having it then?) now your cycle is of 30 days period. so the expected date of ovulation should be 07 january. hence, if the conception takes place on 07 january, the due date of delivery would be 30 september. the hitch here is that you should have ovulation taking lace on 07 january. moreover, we have noticed that all the pregnancies do not last for 280 days. the delivery can take place any time between 3 weeks earlier to 1 week later than the expected due date of delivery. keeping these facts and calculations in mind, you may plan your sexual relations accordingly. i hope this will help you."

"a have low by , a slightly leaky heart valve ( not serious ) - had pain in legs then abdomen , then chest , last august & told had sludge in gall bladder ( now cleared ) . had 2 to a since then & have had thrush twice . a experience burning in lower arms & legs & at times i have dizziness & nausea .",1,61263,"welcome to chat doctor ! i have gone through your question, and there are some important concerns: you have sludge in gall bladder, fatty liver, bloating abdomen due to which you can't eat adequately. you have test done for ovarian cancer which is normal. there is no other blood test like - lipid profile, thyroid, renal function test, which will be helpful in your treatment. from my clinical experience i would say that the bloating, and fullness of stomach are due to sludgy gall bladder. food is not digested properly when there is fatty liver, and sludge in gall bladder. there is difficulty in digesting fats and other important nutrient from food, even proteins. so, what ever small you eat makes you feel heavy and full. had i been your doctor i would go for some lipid reducing chat doctor? i think you must consult a surgeon, as many times the sludgy gall bladder needs to be removed with surgery. the sludge sometimes does slip in bile duct and can result in acute abdominal pain. i'm not trying to scare you but just informing you about the possibilities as you are having significant fullness and bloating. i want to tell you that it is not a serious illness. had i been at your place, i would go for soft, non-spicy, non-oily diet. avoid food from outside unless it is thoroughly cooked. this does help in bloating. small and frequent meals also help along with medicines. please stop alcohol (if you take it!) completely as it graves the illness. i have seen antacids like omeprazole 20 mg twice a day, half hour before meals, give immediate relief. syrups like di gene can be taken as and when required, about three four times day. however, most importantly you should go and meet a doctor (preferably a surgeon). hope the answer helps you. feel free to ask more queries."

a have a chest cough which has been getting worse over the past week and half to 2 weeks it started off as a sore throat i feel like in finding it a bit harder to breathe i went to the doctors but could only be seen by a nurse prctioner who told me she couldn't hear anything my chest was a lot quite than what it should be so she int sure if there is anything there or not she said my heart was racing but i haven done any strenuous activity . she has given me some anti biotic to see how i go but in worried,1,34552,"the only thing for a cold sensation i can think of is acid reflux. when you get heart burn it feels crazy and can give anxiety (hence the rapid heart rate). you can remedy acid reflux (herd, or heart burn, throat burn or whatever you want to call it) by getting some digestive enzymes (try something like source naturals daily digestive enzymes) at a local vitamin store (or try vitacost.com) and till give her enough digestive juices to help grind up her food better. also, food intolerances will cause problems too. i discovered a food intolerance to wheat, milk and peanuts. but you have to write down how you feel after you eat something and try eliminating it for a while and see how it goes. you can ask a doctor for an elisa test (for food allergies) but it doesn't tell us much. a food elimination/rotation diet is much better plus it can't hurt. a sharp knife like feeling is definitely heart burn from what i've felt or heard about. make sure you write down when these things occur, what time and how long (dates) and what she had to eat earlier. pizza is a biggie on heart burn. hot dogs, anything with bad fats in it. bread if she is intolerant to wheat and so on. i would throw in a thyroid (tsh) test for hyper or hypothyroidism. so many symptoms stem from those diseases (difficulty breathing, rapid heart rate, digestion issues and so on)...that it should be warranted just to rule it out. and if it keeps happening see the doc. but sometimes i do believe we have to be our own detectives. my dd has a friend that was ill on and off for a couple of years and saw 11 doctors (hello, aren't they supposed to be intelligent beings?) but no, they couldn't figure out anything. finally, they figured out she has a gluten-allergy."

my eight year daughter had a decaying back tooth . the dentist took part of the tooth away so it did to affect the growth of the adult tooth . a soft lump keeps appearing on the gum next to it . we have squeezed it three times and released sum fluid and blood . what could it be ?,1,76487,"thank you for your query, from what i could make out from the symptoms written above is that you have decaying tooth structure in your mouth with surrounding gums closing the tooth structure. the tooth on your right side can be non-vital and carious exposed leading to fracturing of the tooth structure. this leads to erosion of the tooth structure below the gum line and the adjacent gums start covering it and sometimes leading to infection and swelling. best advice is to consult you dentist and get it treated."

(as you said he has difficulty in walking now). you can also say to his parents that --- they can continue with all religious customs along with medicines, may be then they will agree... with medicine, he will start showing improvement in few days only... it is psychosis and patients will not agree to go to any doctor willingly, so you might need to take him forcefully. this is well accepted as it is for his benefit only. even if he doesn't agree for oral medicine there are injectables which are given to such patients... take the right step, take him to a doctor. hope the reply is useful feel free to ask more questions"
"my mother is 85 year old . post femur fracture surgery she is psychologically insecure , and has fixed her attention to going to toilet-continuously , day and night . talking her out of it has been futile . her physical health has been perfect otherwise . what can be done ?",1,110490,"hi, i understand your concerns about the health of your mother and i will try to explain at you the risks for such surgery at a patient at 85 years old. first that you must understand is that the main problem here is not the procedure itself. an expert surgeon might do a laparoscopic cholecystectomy without any problem and this procedure lasts around 30 to 40 minutes. the main risks are correlated with her age, her heart disease, kidney and liver function and if she has other chronic problems or not. for example if your mother has only hbp, it is not a problem to do the surgery. but if she has cardiopulmonary compromise than she has high risks for cardiac complications. it would be great if i had the medical reports of your mother, and medical history to know her risks/complications. if all her organs are working fine, especially her heart, liver and kidneys than she might do the surgery and probably without any serious complications during or after the surgery. her surgeon and her anesthesiologist will be able to give you more information than me for her risks and complications because they know her medical history, and function of her other organs. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."
"my mother is 85 year old . post femur fracture surgery she is psychologically insecure , and has fixed her attention to going to toilet-continuously , day and night . talking her out of it has been futile . her physical health has been perfect otherwise . what can be done ?",2,42968,"basically your mother is suffering from breast cancer which has been operated upon, and she is a known patient of heart disease for which she has been scented. the biopsy shows that at least one node has tumor. ideally in such a situation i would recommend chemotherapy to her. but that she can't take safely due to her heart condition. what i would like to know before i can comment upon her survival is the size of the tumor that was removed and whether it has spread to other parts of the body (on chest x-ray, ultrasound abdomen, bone scan). if it's an early tumor (less than 5 cm in size, not spread), then the chances of her being cured just with surgery are nearly 80%. we can further improve these chances by knowing her receptor status. this test can be done on the tumor that has already been removed and is called er (estrogen receptor) and pr (progesterone receptor). if any of these are positive then she can be placed on a tablet for 5 years. this tablet will not affect her heart and decrease the chances of disease recurrence by almost 33%."

"hello doctor , pm 28 years old and a have a daughter of 5yrs old pm trying for my second baby but a he a problem of pcs . my doctor suggested me closed 100mg for 5days and again week later she suggested me closed 50mg for 5 days but still i can not be able to ovulate . an a please help me how can i get pregnantthank you lamp",1,52747,"hello, and i hope i can clarify this for you. you are absolutely correct in the fact that the length of your cycle is related to when you ovulate... and your ovulation date is 14 days back from when you got your period, rather than counting 14 days from the start of your period. it is typical for most women to have a 14-day luteal phase, as you suggested. you absolutely may ovulate later in your cycle. i do not know how long you and your partner have tried to conceive before trying closed. i would not recommend trying closed at all unless you have tried for a year (meaning unprotected sex at least 2-3 times per week) and not become pregnant. a reproductive endocrinologist is an appropriate referral if you have a history of infertility for one year, and if you fail at least 3 cycles of closed. they can prescribe closed and combine it with intrauterine insemination, which can increase the success rate. even though you may have had a child together before, there can be an issue with the male partner too, and it would be advisable he gets his sperm count evaluated. but you can still have conceived this cycle if you ovulated on the closed, and continued to have unprotected sex at least a week after your ovulation kit showed positive. your progesterone level pre-ovulation is not relevant at all. so- if you don't get a period by day 35 or so, do a pregnancy test. and if you didn't conceive this cycle, a reproductive endocrinologist might be a better choice to manage your closed. i hope this answered your question, and best of luck in getting pregnant. take care,"

"recently me and my boyfriend had sex and the condom broke during it . the next morning , about 8 hours later , i used the morning after pill ( next choice ) . a had just had my period less than a week before that so i was to supposed to get again for another 3-4 weeks . about 2 days after taking the pill i started bleeding and for two days after that i still had a heavy flow . a haven to stopped bleeding and this is now day 3 . a researched it and saw that heavy bleeding could mean my menstrual cycle was messed up from the pill or it could a side effect of being pregnant . now do i know the difference and if i should go to the doctor ?",1,77098,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. many women who have been on birth control for many years can develop a tolerance of sorts for the pills' ability to control your menstrual cycle, especially after they have not menstruated for a long time due to pregnancy or another cause. this can also occur to the fact that you did relatively recently give birth, especially if you were breastfeeding. bleeding when you are not supposed to have your period on the pill is called breakthrough bleeding. it does not mean the pill is ineffective as a contraceptive, but having some irregular bleeding in between periods or a different bleeding pattern that you may have had before the pregnancy is not unusual. having heavy bleeding in the morning is likely due to the blood accumulating in your vagina during the night, and then it all comes out at once when you get out of bed due to gravity. your cycle may get back to normal after a few more months on the pill, and taking it as close to the same time every day will help to reduce the risk of breakthrough bleeding. if it continues for more than 3 months, you may benefit from changing your birth control brand to one with a slightly higher dose of estrogen, as the estrogen in the pill is the ingredient that controls your menstrual cycle. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

hello . a am currently battling a sinus infection and very bad chest congestion and coughing . by primary care physician told me it is safe to take murine while nursing but when a looked up the drug information it stated there are no known studies on the safety of ingesting guafenesin while nursing .,1,22667,"dear patient, i can understand your concern and feel sorry for the pain you are suffering from. you are informing me that when you got the upper molar extracted, the dentist told you that the bone between the sinus and tooth is destroyed and sinus cavity is open. roots of upper molar often are found inside the maxillary sinus, which causes opening of the sinus cavity while extraction of the tooth, creating an oro-antral fistula, that is a direct connection between oral cavity and sinus cavity. in this case, the food or water you take has chances of passing infection in the sinus through mouth and the infection does not resolve. it is mandatory to close this connection between mouth and the sinus. it could be done by the dentist by taking stitches in the area when he found that sinus has opened, but it can also be done now. however, as about 2 weeks has passed since extraction, the opening would not be as much clear as it would have been during extraction. a blood clot may have filled the area. so what you need to do now is, go to an oral surgeon or an ent specialist. i know you have insurance problem, but there seems no other solution to your problem. you might have to go for x-rays and probably ct scan of the area to diagnose if oro-antral fistula actually exists and if it does, you might have to go for a little surgery to close the communication between mouth and sinus followed by antibiotics to resolve the infection. i hope this information helps. thank you for choosing chat doctor. i wish you get well soon. best,"

"hi , i took i- pill almost a month ago and i a having acne on my face and upper body right now .... i be never had acne or any kind of bad pimples on my face before ... its almost a month that i a trying everything to get rid of them ... i a 20 years old .... i had i-pill only twice till now , fist time was like a month before a 2nd time ... i actually had no idea what cause these acres on my face till today and i wan a consult at it with a good dermatologist .. can you guide me ply",1,78259,"hello rama, welcome to chat doctor forum. it is very common to get pimples (acne)at this age due to the hormonal changes taking place in your body with puberty. they do subside as age advances.however, it is advisable to get it treated if you are getting pustules or nodular acne which leave behind hyperpigmented scars on the face causing the face to appear dark. so a consultation with a dermatologist would be beneficial if you really suffer from bad acne scars.meanwhile, here are some tips to help prevent breakouts and clear them up as fast as possible: 1. wash your face twice a day with warm water and a mild soap. gently massage your face. don't scrub. overwashing and scrubbing can cause skin to become irritated. 2.don't pop pimples. its tempting, but you shouldn't: popping pimples can push infected material further into the skin, leading to more swelling and redness, and even scarring. 3. avoid touching your face with your fingers or leaning your face on objects that collect sebum and skin residue like your phone. touching your face can spread the bacteria that cause pores to become inflamed and irritated. to keep bacteria at bay, wash your hands before applying anything to your face, such as treatment creams or makeup.4. keep hair clean and out of your face to prevent additional dirt and oil from clogging your pores.5. protect your skin from the sun. it may seem like a tan masks acne, but its only temporary. a tan may worsen your acne, not improve it. tanning also causes damage to skin .6. avoid over the counter acne creams as each skin type is different and creams prescribed by doctor after examining your skin are preferable. you may apply natural aloe vera gel for better results. regards"

my baby is one year old and he is passing loose stool for past 4 days ... the colour and consistency of the stool is much varying .. the stool colour is sometimes greenish and sometimes brown .. he is music at times and finding little hard on excreting .. plus answer me doctor,1,59118,"thanks for asking on chat doctor. let me ad chat doctor. breast milk is the best food for a baby and there can be no alternatives to that. formula milk like lactose are cow milk based and hence hard to digest for a baby. it may lead to greenish stools. but reddish is not normal, and you should get the stool tested for routine microscopy and occult blood. passing stool 10 times a day is equally normal as passing stool once in 10 days, and you need not bother about it unless the stool is very hard. lactogen 3 is unsuitable for a baby of this age and can be given only after 1 year of age. so stop giving it. i would like to ask what do you mean by normal food. a baby is supposed to receive only breast milk and nothing else till the age of 6 months. in case breast milk is inadequate, supplementation with formula milk can be given, but that should be age appropriate. although it is not a dangerous situation, it needs to be managed properly, and you need to get guidance on this from a pediatrician. visit a doctor with the stool report or post a query directly to me with the report and i would try to help you further."

"a received an abdominal ultrasound and a just got the results through fax and everything looks normal but it says the liver measures 13.2 pm in size , normal in contour with a mildly but diffusely increased echotexture . a was wondering what that meant ? under the impression section is says : fatty liver , normal gallbladder , and the common bile duct measures 0.20 pm in diameter .",1,81321,"hi, thanks for writing in. cancer is a difficult condition to treat, but one should fight it till the end. bile duct cancers are very aggressive and can quickly spread over the involved area. the bile duct conveys the bile generated in the liver to the small intestine through the bile duct. this bile secreted in to the intestine helps in digestion of food. the cancer in bile duct might have caused obstruction to flow of bile and therefore there was jaundice. it is important to know if the entire affected area was removed by surgery and confirmed to be cancer. the stent in place is allowing the bile to pass through without any obstruction and this is reducing the jaundice. if she has not developed cancer anywhere else in the body then she can continue having the stent in place. most likely every gall bladder and bile duct cancer might spread to the liver and that is seen on ultrasound scan or ct scan. once this is done then the survival of a patient is around 6 months to 18 months. if there is no spread to the liver than a patient with a bile duct cancer which has been operated can survive for 2 years."

"a have a blood clot under the skin on upper middle of penis shaft . a pinched the skin while drying with towel 3 months ago , since then a can get normal erections but there is aching and pain particularly afterwards and there is an ever increasing network of spider veins emanating from the clot/injured area . the ache is particularly prevalent on left side by testicles . i have pictures",1,72120,"hi, thanks for writing in. it is possible that there is thrombosis of the veins in her legs. this is an emergency condition, and she must get evaluated for it. the legs have deep veins and when there is any pressure effect of the cancer on the veins in the pelvis, it can cause the blood flow in leg veins to become slow. when this happens then the blood stops flowing and gets clotted in the leg veins. she can get a doppler scan of lower limbs done for the venous system to know if there is deep venous thrombosis. the problem is that this clot can get dislodged at any time and reach the heart and then cause cut off of blood supply to lungs leading to death. if detected and confirmed then it can be treated by medicines to dissolve the clot and make the venous flow normal. please do not worry."

(hide scan) is a nuclear imaging procedure to evaluate the health and function of the gallbladder. a radioactive tracer, usually technetium-99 m, is injected through any accessible vein, then allowed to circulate to the liver, where it is excreted into the biliary system and stored by the gallbladder and biliary system. in the absence of disease, the gallbladder is visualized within 1 hour of the injection of the radioactive tracer. if the gallbladder is not visualized within 4 hours after the injection, this indicates either cholecystitis or cystic duct obstruction. so it depends on the time at which image is taken. diagnosis also varies according to the variation in image n the time of taking an image after injection of radiotracer. so your radiologist who did the procedure n saw the images of hide scan can answer your question better. i hope this will be helpful to you."

"after having sex about 3 days ago i took posting 2 on the 3rd day and that was in the night i then took one this morning which kinda went on to the fourth day , i then experience headache in the right side of my head and i started to feel upset ( nausea ) are these feelings all in responds to the pill",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"i , one is 31 day cycle of period.this time i have taken the medicine for growing egg and its nicely grower after that my doctor gave an injection called hic or chatdoctor then the eggs are came out from the ovary , ( doctor notify it ) today 37th day of my period.i got little bleeding.why this is happens . will i permanent or not ? please answer me.note : is is for my second try the same above procedure .",1,95735,"hallow dear, at the time of ovulation, little spotting for few hours is known. it is called as mittelschmerz. this is very little spotting for few hours. so after the spotting is over, there is no harm in having intercourse. bleeding on day 6 of the cycle cannot be mittelschmerz. it is just an extended menstrual bleeding. during menstrual bleeding, intercourse carries risk of infection since blood is a very good medium for the growth of pathogens. on this day intercourse is futile also since there is no egg present on this day. the fertile period is not around day 6 of the cycle. the egg is released 14 days prior to the next expected menses. the egg has life of 24 hours and the sperms are active for 72 hours. hence, a period of about a week around the day of egg release (ovulation) is considered as fertile period. those who are keen to have pregnancy should concentrate on this period for sexual relations. you are following further with bbt also to identify the day of ovulation. now you have more accurate methods available for locating the day of ovulation. ovulation kits available in the market are good for practical purpose. ultrasonography ovulation monitoring is a very good method. from day 9 of the cycle, daily ultrasonography informs about the development of follicle & endometrium and the event of egg release also. follicles which ovulate when they are between 18 mm to 21 mm size have best results of conception and continuation of pregnancy. for successful implantation of fertilized ovum, endometrium of 10 mm or more thickness is lucrative. considering the life of egg and sperms, you can definitely avoid the intercourse during mittelschmerz since it is a short phase of the day; and still have successful intercourse during or around the ovulation. i hope this helps you."

hi my answer .what is the risk of suddenly death post laparoscopic cholecystectomy on second day if the patient previously healthy .and what my cause it ? ? ?,2,78745,"hi.noted history of gallbladder surgery through laparoscopic cholecystectomy. recovery of patient from any surgery or procedure is relative or case to case basis. if you have other co-morbidities or diseases, the higher the risk of complications. also, depending on the severity of your case, your surgeon might want to observe you longer than expected, hence, the longer hospital stay. a laparoscopic cholecystectomy may be an ambulatory procedure in some institutions. on average, hospital stay is usually 2-3days. but as i've mentioned earlier, recovery of a patient is multifactorial as well. you could ask/discuss with your surgeon re your current status/plan of management. am sure, he or she is willing to answer any of your questions related to the operation performed. early ambulation and deep breathing exercises are highly encouraged. low fat diet post-surgery will be advised accordingly. hope this helps. good day!!~ chat doctor."
hi my answer .what is the risk of suddenly death post laparoscopic cholecystectomy on second day if the patient previously healthy .and what my cause it ? ? ?,3,101647,"hi, how are you? my name is chat doctor. i am a liver and pancreas specialist and i hope to answer your question today. i am sorry to hear about your mothers condition. gall bladders tend to become thick walled and shrunken in patients who have repeated bouts of inflammation (cholecystitis). this will make it very difficult for the surgeon to remove, especially by laparoscopic (keyhole) technique. the normal procedure in such cases would be to do an open cholecystectomy, which involves making a 7-10 cm incision on the abdomen and then removing the gall bladder under vision. the dangers of leaving behind the gall bladder depends on what the original reason for the surgery was. leaving behind the gall bladder due to stone disease will put the patient at risk for further attacks of cholecystitis, but a still worrisome reason would be if any cancer occurs in the gb which would mandate that an open cholecystectomy be done. in summary, i would advise you to consider an open cholecystectomy to avoid future complications. hope this helps and hope your mother starts to feel better. please do not hesitate to contact me for further details rxsuresh@gmail.com. have a great day"

i have been having pain in the middle of my chest off and on for a few months now . over the past week or so i am having worse chest pains that last most of the day off and on . sometimes it is sharp pain today it is dull and achy and my back is sore too,3,24397,"there are quite a long list of other therapies for the pain. the operation issue intrigues me because the shoulder and the back are not connected. and the shoulder if it is the part down below the neck is inside the chest and doesn't get much wear and tear. if it is at the neck, then neck disk disease is very, very common and almost always shows up on regular x-rays. but. has nothing to do with back and legs in the vast majority. back to pain management: there are multiple levels. obviously the first level is what is broken and fixing it with the surgery. the second level is the pain produced from the problem. nerve pills sometimes work. muscle relaxants sometimes work. amitriptyline is both a nerve pill (like lidocaine) and a blocker of pain signals at the spine. the third level is the context in which the pain is held. while lately everyone is talking about mindfulness and yoga, frankly you might as well try a fidget spinner. i am highly dubious about all of them. but, having the pain be directed by oneself and having it decrease is known to be among the most effective modulators of pain. so, if you can do exercise or physical therapy in the context of making it painful, then the pain experience is less after creating the pain and with repeating it the pain goes down (except during the physical therapy where it goes up for the first 2 months then stabilizes but is still painful)."

"hi i am 33 5 11 165 pounds and have been having lower back problems , it started a few months ago but is now getting worse . when i touch my spine on the right side it really hurts but the muscles around it do not hurt nor does the left side of the spine",1,92326,"hi there. thanks for your question at chat doctor. straightening of lumbar spine(as seen in your x-ray) indicates spasm of the muscles around your spine. the muscles of our back go into spasm after any painful stimulus(the stimulus can be sprained muscle or a pinched nerve or slip disc). this spasm of the muscle around the spine is responsible for straightening of spine. so it is the effect of the pain and not the cause of pain.x-ray is an investigation for the bony structure of your spine. it does not give a y information about a pinched nerve or a slip disc. mri will give a better idea about the source of your pain. if you have numbness in your legs, and you have completed 6 weeks of treatment with medicines and physiotherapy, it would be prudent to rule out the cause of pain by getting an mri of your lumbar(lower) spine. hope this helps. all the best. chat doctor."

"i . a took plan a a few weeks ago . 2 days afterwards a had a normal period of 4 days , even though a want due for my period until 2 weeks after that . a know plan a can cause a period so this didst seem abnormal . but then a few days later a started bleeding again . this was 10 days ago and pm still bleeding/spotting . it wont stop . is this normal or should a get it checked out ? thanks",1,46621,"hallow dear, i pill contains progestational medicine. after taking these pills, some amount of spotting to bleeding is common to occur (break through bleeding); even sometimes the regular expected period also may get delayed up to one week or so. after such delayed period, usually trail bleeding is not known commonly. however, your period has appeared rather earlier than the expected period. it is likely that this was not a regular period but was an extension of break through bleeding. now this bleeding you have got may be your regular periods. alternatively, this is some trail bleeding after your regular period. very rarely it may happen so. such bleeding would stop within few days. if it does not, you may take some progestational pill like devilry till the bleeding stops; 4-7 days after discontinuing these pills, you will again get some bleeding for few days (mostly you won't require this). if the bleeding is minimal, you may ignore it. such irregularity is not reported occurring in subsequent months. i hope this helps you."

"hello , my mother has many health issues , andres had since she was born with colitis . however , recently she has been getting periods of profusely sweating , followed by the chills , and her abdomen is severely tender to the touch . these hot flashes have been getting increasingly worse and now the bottom of her feet are even sweating . a mean , one minute she is dry , and the next she is soaking wet and has to change her clothes .",1,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

my teeth is getting problem by bacteria there is some black cavity in my teeth and even i a loosing dentine on teeth so can a tell me ply that what should i have to do for getting white and healthy teeth and how to prevent bacterial effect on my teeth ?,1,85853,"hi. welcome to chat doctor . i have gone through your query and can understand your health concerns... as per your complaint if you have all your teeth decayed then it is very much apparent that there must be infection in many of your teeth as well as gums and the bad breath is also due to multiple decayed teeth which would also be causing food judgements and poor hygiene conditions in your mouth and all of this must be having deleterious effect on the gums causing gum infection also. you are feeling sick in your stomach as well as there is weakness because of two reasons:1. the bacteria present in the mouth that is causing infections must be getting carried to the stomach along with food and water and causing stomach infections leading to stomach upset, indigestion, improper absorption of nutrients into the body leading to weakness as well.2. in absence of healthy teeth the food is not being chewed well and as some digestive process starts in the mouth itself with the enzymes present in the saliva, so when food is not chewed well this process is also disturbed and when the uncrewed or partially chewed food reaches the stomach the digestion is more or less incomplete, and it can add up to indigestion. the best way to get rid of all this is that you should get the treatment of your teeth done by a dentist. get a full mouth x-ray known as orthopantomogram [opg] done and get all your teeth evaluated. in case for those teeth which could not be saved, get them extracted while those teeth which have some scope of preserving it's better to get them treated with root canal treatment followed by capping of teeth with or without post and core as per the requirement. the teeth extracted can be replaced with either removable or fixed dental prosthesis. brush your teeth twice daily and use concentrated mouthwash twice a day for gargles and reducing bacterial count. do warm saline gargles twice a day. always gargle with water or using mouthwash after meals. for stomach infection you can consult a gastroenterologist to get ruled out whether you have infection or not. in case of stomach infection ciprofloxacin 5oo mg twice a day, metronidazole 4oo mg three times a day and pantoprazole 4o mg once in morning empty stomach and once at night. chat doctor. . hope this information helps. if you find the answer helpful please give me a five-star review and click on found the answer helpful as a token of appreciation. thanks and regards."

"hello , my husband and a are trying to conceive and a know we have to keep trying for at least a year but a just want to make sure we are doing it the right way . by question is this : overtime we have intercourse , right after , a always pee . i also wash my vagina with cold water , to remove the stickiness of the sperm which makes me uncomfortable . ( a was the outside and a little on the inside with the tip of my finger ) to these 2 things minimize my chances of conceiving ? ( 1 ) peeing ( 2 ) washing ?",1,111986,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. in normal healthy couples, it can sometimes even take up to a year to conceive. 80% of couples will conceive within one year if having regular unprotected intercourse (at least 2 to 3 days per week). it is best not to time the efforts of intercourse around ovulation unless you have accurately documented the ovulation date, with an ovulation predictor kit or with hormone levels checked at the doctor's office. the best way to try to conceive in the beginning is to have sex every other day from the time your period finishes until you start to feel premenstrual symptoms. premenstrual symptoms are caused by the same hormones as produced by pregnancy, so when you start to feel bloating, breast tenderness, nausea, or other pregnancy symptoms you do not need to continue to try to conceive that cycle, as you either already ovulated or are already pregnant. there are nearly 6 million sperm in every ejaculate from a man, so as long as some sperm is ejaculated inside the vagina, there is a possibility of conceiving. many women have sperm leak out after intercourse, however the ability of sperm to swim within the vagina ensures that a man with a normal sperm count has at least thousands of sperm that reach the egg if ovulation has been taking place. so in summary, many couples do not conceive within two months of beginning to try. i encourage you and your husband to have patience. in the meantime, the best way to prepare for healthy pregnancy is to get adequate rest, eat a healthy diet, avoid alcohol consumption, and take a prenatal vitamin or folic acid supplement which can help prevent birth defects. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"hello , a had salmonella in my blood as following : of : 1/80bh : negative : 1/80o : 1/160however , a didst feel any of its known indications . a started remedy using cebrofloxacin four days ago . now long should a take medicine ? is it safe to have sex with wife ?",1,14136,"welcome to chat doctor! i have gone through your query carefully and see that you have history of epilepsy and now have increased complain of aura after you were being started on wellbutrin for ptsd. you also have a family history of seizure disorder in your brother. due to increase in aura you were shifted to zoloft by your treating doctor. now you are looking for some better alternative for ptsd which is safe for seizure patients. i can say from my experience that wellbutrin, i.e., bupropion is not a chat doctor. even a normal person who never had a seizure may develop one when put on any dose of wellbutrin, especially dosage above 300 mg. so, it can be directly related to increased complained of aura you had after starting this medicine. as now, you have been shifted to zoloft, which is a very safe medicine, and is not known to be associated with any significant potential to increase to cause seizure, i think you can proceed with it. if i have any such patient in my clinic i usually go for escitalopram or sertraline (zoloft). both are ok in cases similar to yours. for as and when required basis, i find clonazepam effective in such cases as an additional medicine. hope the reply is useful feel free to ask more questions"

"i , a am 28 years old . a have been trying to conceive since last 1 year but with no result . a have got my initial checkups done . thyroid is normal , chatdoctor test is normal . last month a got follicular study done and on 17th day my follicle size was 27mm but it was not ruptured yet . can this be the reason of me not able to conceive . please help",1,10535,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. pregnacare conception is simply a combination of vitamins that help a woman have a healthy pregnancy from conception. it has no hormonal effects and should not have any impact on the regularity of your cycle nor your ability to conceive, it is not unusual for women to bleed on and off for even 6 weeks after a miscarriage so the 19-day bleeding episode you had may not have actually been a menstrual period but still could have been bleeding leftover for your d and c. so you may not be ""late"" at all, but may just have not had a real period since the pregnancy. there is no reason to assume you would have problems getting pregnant again since you have conceived naturally twice in the last year. either way, the pregnancies conception vitamins have nothing to do with your irregular bleeding. it is generally advisable to wait to try to conceive again after your first real period-so i would wait until you bleed again to resume trying to conceive. if you do not get a real period by 3 months from your last bleeding episode, you should follow up for your gun for a re-evaluation of your hormones and treatment with progesterone, which can restart your period cycling. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful. best wishes,"

hi doc . i have question.my problem is aortic stenosis.i have not any clinical symptom i mean i haunt pain in my chest/fatigue/dizziness and so on . but my doctor told me some advise as you khnow.i wanted to know can i have take vitamin ? can i use mineral supplement or not.i mean vitamin tablet.and my last exotic question is i have alopecia and can we use minoxidile.thank doc,1,31189,"hello and thank you for using chat doctor. i carefully read your question and i understand your concern. ii will give you my opinion. when we treat hypertension our goal is to achieve mean values below 140/90 mmhg. a hypertensive patient might have excessive values under physical or emotional stress and this is normal but when we talk about daily mean values they should be under 140/90. only with these values we can say that we have a good and controlled blood pressure. so, if you say that in a random measurement you find high values like 167/93 it might be reasonable to rise your medicament dosage. in fact the april dose that you take is a very small one. so my opinion as a cardiologist is that you can rise the dosage to 2.5 and even 5 mg because it can't cause any harm. it will lower your blood pressure values to 120/80 and this is our target for you. of course, it is mandatory to know some blood analyses to do so like your creatinine levels, so i advise you to consult it with your cardiologist. hope i was helpful. wish you good health. best regards."

"a had unprotected sex last night and a done want to get pregnant . by last period date was 20th august2011 , should a use emergency contraceptive pill ? is it safe ? a have heard that after having such medicines , periods become very irregular and lot of other side effects are there .",2,46547,"helloyour query is appreciated. the chances of pregnancy here depend on a lot of things. if intercourse occurred between the 10th and 20th days of the menstrual cycle, then chances of pregnancy are high. for e.g., if the female had her period on 1st november, and you had intercourse between 10th and 20th of november, the chances of getting pregnant are very higchatdoctorpared to other days. also, pill was taken immediately after unprotected intercourse, hence you have already done your best to prevent pregnancy. nothing further can be done right now to prevent pregnancy. you will have to wait till the date of her next menstrual period, in order to confirm whether she has conceived inspire of the pill. if she does cross the date of her expected periods, kindly perform a urine pregnancy test to rule out a pregnancy. however, with one random encounter of unprotected intercourse, plus the timely intake of pill, in my personal opinion, the chances of pregnancy are very low. and you definitely can do nothing about it now, apart from the pill, which you have already taken. hence, you should relax and wait for her period. meanwhile, ensure that further such episodes of unprotected intercourse are avoided. hope this helped you."

by daughter had car accident recently .. diagnosed with blood contusion in area of bottom of brain to top of spinal cord . the is unsteady on her feet sluggish sounding low feverish nausea- given muscle relaxers and naproxen .. is there something else going on ?,1,67021,"hi the problems you stated, point towards a spinal cord injury that occurred during the accident. spinal cord is the nerves in the bach that carry signal from the brain to the legs and back. something like electric wires. when these nerves get cut/damaged, there is no transmission of signal. so there is no feeling in legs and no feeling of urine. with such severe injuries, there is no such medicines or surgery that can repair the cord and bring complete recovery of function. what is feasible is rehabilitation. training in the form of learning self transfers from bed to wheelchair, self intermittent catheterization of the bladder etc. there is extensive research going on with the use of stem cells in such patients, with a few claiming minor improvements. but this is still in the research phase. bye"

(as you said he has difficulty in walking now). you can also say to his parents that --- they can continue with all religious customs along with medicines, may be then they will agree... with medicine, he will start showing improvement in few days only... it is psychosis and patients will not agree to go to any doctor willingly, so you might need to take him forcefully. this is well accepted as it is for his benefit only. even if he doesn't agree for oral medicine there are injectables which are given to such patients... take the right step, take him to a doctor. hope the reply is useful feel free to ask more questions"

"hello , i was recently masturbating last night for the first time and i orgasm and then ejaculated.about 20 mind later i checked out my penis again , to find that there was a lump on the shaft of my penis ( left side ) it stung when i pressed it in at first but a day later i went to school and when i came back i checked to see if it was better ( and it was ) then i pressed it in again and it direct sting at all.if you need my age i am 12also there is some tiny pimples on my penis going all the way to the top , they do not hurt or itch in any way so in not really bothered in any way.i do not want to see any doctor .",1,37527,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. even though your boyfriends penis was inside you for only a short time, sperm can be present in pre-ejaculate (or pre-cum) and if you truly do not want to become pregnant it is really important to avoid any contact of the penis with your vagina during sexual play. the most fertile time of a woman cycle is in the middle, typically 14 days before your menstrual period would be due. so the time from when your period finishes until you start to feel pms symptoms is your fertile time. so in this case, since your boyfriend did not ejaculate, it still would be quite rare for you to have conceived. the most common sign of pregnancy is a late or delayed menstrual period. so in your case, you just need to wait for your period to arrive, and if it is late, you can do an over-the-counter urine pregnancy test which is greater than 99% accurate. pregnancy test do not become positive however until at least 2 to 3 weeks after conception. so in summary, your chances of having gotten pregnant in your particular situation is very, very low. for the future, please make sure that the penis is completely covered with a condom if it has any contact with the opening of your vagina. as long as the area is moist, sperm can swim all the way up your vagina from the opening and result in pregnancy. however, the amount of sperm in pre-cum is extremely low, so again i doubt that you need to be concerned about this one sexual encounter. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was helpful. best wishes,"

(regular use of emergency pill is harmful)conception occurs if she was in 10th to 18th day of her cycle(in a regular cycle of 28 day duration). you can ask her at what day she is in and wait for next cycle to occur. if it delayed by 7 days then get done upt to diagnose if pregnant and then the required treatment can be taken. regards"

is a have only rubbed on her vagina and also dip a little bit there is no intercourse hardly there is only a little and my sperm dent appear fully inside her it will a little and she will dent appear her sperm .... den she does masturbation den sperm appears .... and she take unwanted 72 on 6 day .... is there any chances of pregnancy ... plus reply,1,102839,"hi, i guess your concern is about getting pregnant of your girlfriend from pre-ejaculatory liquid near vagina. so my straight forward answer is, yes. there are chances but it's very, very less to getting her pregnant. usually chances of getting pregnant is more when ejaculation occurs when penis is inside the vagina. but in your case as you told that your penis did not go inside the vagina, and you were just rubbing it against her outer vagina. so there is very, very less chance of getting pregnant. so don't worry, relax. you also told that u didn't have condom on that time. and there is pre-ejaculation occurs around her vagina. so there is little chances having for getting pregnant. for that you do not need to take tension because your girlfriend can use emergency contraceptive pill (i-pill) within 72 hrs of unprotected intercourse. as told by you that you people had intercourse 2 days ago. so there is sufficient time to take emergency contraception. this is usually available your nearby medical store at affordable prices. with this above discussion you can try out my suggestions-1. don't waste time and get the i-pill as early as possible. ask your girlfriend to take it. wait till her next menses. if she gets menses on her expected or delay date, she will not be pregnant. 2. you can do urinary pregnancy test after 5-6 days of her missed period. it is available at affordable prices your nearby medical store. buy it and ask your girlfriend to do it by herself. if it is negative, she's not pregnant. if it is positive visit to nearby gynecologist for further help. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further. chat doctor."

a had unprotected sex about 4 weeks ago and my period should start about now . a have had some cramps but i just started a new type of birth control and haven started yet . a also looked online and found the amount of birth control to take that equals the plan a pill and took them awhile after . pm a pregnant or am a just psychic myself out ?,1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

a few days ago i was taking a vitamin just as i was ending a conversation and it felt as though it did not travel down my throat but possibly down my windpipe ? pm just wondering what would be the possible effects of if i were to have aspirated the vitamin into my lung ?,1,41963,"hellowelcome to chat doctor. i have gone through your description. you have mentioned that you felt the vitamin pill not going down your thrust but into your wind pipe. did you have any symptoms during that? any food or foreign body that goes into the lungs causes a very severe cough during the episode. this is a defense mechanism of the lungs to protect against aspiration of foreign bodies. the cough persists for some time and if the thing is not expelled with cough then it settles down blocking one of the smaller airways. this may lead to chronic cough, recurrent infection and pneumonia. if it blocks the smaller airways, and there is recurrent pneumonia then it can be removed with the help of a procedure called bronchoscopy which removes the aspirated body under video guidance. as in your case you have not mentioned any severe cough while swallowing the pill or any chronic cough or recurrent lung infection thereafter, i do not suspect that you have aspirated the pill into your windpipe. so unless you had the above symptoms there is not much to worry about. wishing you good healthregards"

hello this is savithri i had a miscarriage yesterday i was 18 weeks and i had a slight bleeding and went to the doctor and doctor to be ultrasound and found the baby has changed and there is no heartbeat so i had to undergo dec which was like a normal delivery i have first baby who is self and it was accident and but me and baby did not have any complications but now the second baby died during the second prime minister second prime minister my i want to know why the baby died during 18th week when my 13th week scan was normal i want to know the reason for the heartbeat to stop after the 13th week what would be the possible reasons so that i could be precautions in my next pregnancy in case thanks,1,85262,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. there are two possibilities of what may be going on if you do not yet see a heartbeat with your pregnancy. the first, even though you are sure of your lmp, conception can take place at a different time in your cycle than you expected. the egg can live inside you up to 72 hours after ovulation, and sperm can remain alive inside you for up to 5 days. so you actually may have conceived a week later than you thought, which means that you are only 6 weeks pregnant. it can be normal to not see a heartbeat at 6 weeks. the other possibility is that the fetus died already at 6 weeks, which is a miscarriage that has not come out yet. the way we can figure out what is going on is to check another ultrasound in a week or so. if there is no heartbeat by 7 weeks, then the diagnosis of a miscarriage is correct. so i know it is hard to be patient, but there is nothing that can be done to prevent miscarriage. one of every 10 pregnancies are miscarriages, meaning 90 percent of the time after a miscarriage women go on to have a healthy baby. i hope i was able to answer your question and that this information was helpful to you. best wishes, and good luck with the pregnancy,"
