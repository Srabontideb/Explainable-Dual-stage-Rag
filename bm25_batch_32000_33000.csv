a am taking metformin for the first time . a did take 2 tablets 500 my and my blood sugar is much higher than it was this of . in the label it said to take 2 tabs by mouth every day . nothing about taking 2xs in a day . it did say with food . now long does it take to see any change . is it a few hours after or is it days ?,1,30579,"hi ! your flu and the diarrhea with abdominal cramps may or may not be related. in case of child chat doctor. the first diagnosis comes to the mind is a food poisoning. possibly you did not receive proper complete treatment for it and this led to more severe cramps in your abdomen. you did not mention anything about fever. if it was there, then it goes more in favor of infection in the intestines. there is no harm in taking antacid and antiflatulents, but i am not in favor of your taking enema. after any loose motions, it is but natural that the bowel becomes empty, and it takes time for the bowel to get loaded with fecal matter to get the urge of passing stool again. also, without knowing the exact cause of the cramps in your abdomen which could be any surgical cause like diverticulitis, one should not opt for an anemia. it is difficult to tell whether the swelling on the left side of your lower abdomen is due simple inflammation with mass formation or a leaking diverticulitis precipitated by self enema by yourself. in my opinion, you should consult at your earliest a general surgeon, who may advise some routine investigations for you apart from going for an ultrasound / ct scan depending on the initial examination findings. one more possibility of the swelling is left sided inguinal hernia, but your history does not go much in favor of it. anyways i think it is time for you to see your general surgeon and seek his advice. good luck."

"by husband had a mild heart attack three years ago , at aged 39 . since then , he has been on a variety of standard medications - including high blood pressure beds - and has had 12 stents placed over four procedures . is last two routine lab tests showed an elevated microalbumin ( 300 ) and slightly high fasting blood glucose ( 103-105 ) . in ultrasound of his kidneys revealed small cysts , but he shows no signs of kidney failure or inherited disease , and all of his other blood work is normal . would his beds be causing these kidney issues ?",1,26625,"hi, brief answer: very elevated blood pressures will generally require long term management with blood pressure medications. the risks of stroke heart attack, and kidney failure from untreated high blood pressure greatly outweighs the risks from taking the blood pressure medication. detailed answer: blood pressure measures the force at which blood pushes on the wall of the blood vessels. high blood pressure (hypertension) is a very common condition. high blood pressure puts stress on the heart and can cause the heart to fail and cause heart attacks. high blood pressure in the brain can lead to a stroke or cause bleeding in the brain. high blood pressure can also damage the kidney. to reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke, or kidney failure, high blood pressure needs to be treated. treatment of high blood pressure includes lifestyle changes like eating a well-balanced heart healthy diet, exercising regularly, stress reduction, losing weight if overweight, chat doctor. very high blood pressure (or stage 2 hypertension), like your sons, can require two or more (sometimes up to four) blood pressure medications to get under control. there are single pills that actually contain a combination of blood pressure medications, so that would make taking medication a bit easier for your son. all medications have side effects and risks. blood pressure medications can cause the blood pressure to become to low and cause lightheadedness, dizziness, and nausea. some medications can cause imbalance of electrolytes like sodium and potassium. however, these risk from taking medications are far outweighed by both the benefit of treating high blood pressure on overall health in the long-term and by the risk of not treating high blood pressure. appropriately treating high blood pressure has been shown to greatly reduce risk of heart failure, heart attack, stroke, and death. i would encourage you and your son talk to his doctor about his blood pressure medications and options to reduce the number of pills that he is prescribed. hope i have answered your question. let me know if i can assist you further."

"a am suffering from asthma and whenever a drink milk , a suffer with respiratory problems . any particular reason ?",1,32068,"hello, welcome to chat doctor, it is not clear from your question that at what time you use to take milk. in my opinion if you take milk in the morning, you will get fewer problems. but if you take it at bedtime, can create more problems. as you are suffering with asthma, you can be allergic to milk protein also. and if you are allergic to milk protein, then every time you take milk, you will suffer with respiratory problems irrespective of time. the 2nd reason, which can cause problem is poor digestion of milk protein. i want to tell you that as our age advances, our ability to digest milk generally decreases due to poor secretion of enzyme responsible for it, which can cause flatulence & thus aggravate respiratory problems. thus, you should avoid all those foods, which aggravates your respiratory problems. wish you good health,"

"a am a healthy 18 year old female . a am very aware of my heart beating , and sometimes see my stomach pushing up with the rhythm of my heartbeat . a am taking medium for acid reflux . is acid reflux related to this strong awareness or is it independent ?",1,16527,"hi, how are you? my name is chat doctor. i am a surgical gastroenterologist and i hope to answer your question today. i am sorry to hear all the issues you are having. bile reflux is very rare condition, and it usually happens after a part of the stomach has been removed due to various reasons. i am pretty sure (reading your symptoms) that you are suffering from acid peptic disease with gastroesophageal reflux. this usually happens due to excessive acid secretion in the stomach. also during the night, while sleeping acid seeps into the throat and can go into the lungs which causes coughing and sleeplessness. a combination of lifestyle modifications and medications usually can control the symptoms in up to 95% of patients. avoiding smoking, alcohol, spicy food and heavy meals is the key. small frequent meals should be the norm. also avoid citrus fruits. please do not lay down for a minimum of 2 hours post eating. and while sleeping in the night, make sure the head end of your cot is raised 15 - 30 degrees. an over the counter antacid (pantoprazole, omeprazole etc.) has high efficacy in decreasing acid production and this coupled with a prokinetic (risperidone, metaclopramide) prevents the reflux. your condition is very easy to treat. please do consult a physician who will be able to prescribe these medications. hope this helps and hope you start to feel better. please do not hesitate to write back for further clarifications."

(search asthma diary template in google images)4. avoid triggers like smoke, agarbattis, cockroaches, perfumes, face powder, and wash bedsheets, curtains regularly. do wet mopping and not sweeping especially if your child is around. clean ac filters once a week. she will most likely outgrow this once she is about 7 to 10 years of age (unless there is a strong family history of wheeze/asthma), so lifelong medications will not be needed. we have seen many child"

"a lacerated my liver over 2 months ago , i was in the hospital for a week but did not need surgery . a followed my doctors orders and still have some discomfort . today is my 21st birthday and i want to have a beer , would that significantly slow my healing progress ?",1,8772,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the proper way to use the nearing is to put it in, leave it in for 3 weeks, take it out, wait one week, and replace it. during the week you are not wearing the ring, you should have some bleeding that is considered a menstrual cycle. if you wore the ring continuously for two months and then had a new one replaced but only removed it 3 days later, the pinkish spotting was your ""period"", which is caused by not wearing the ring. the bleeding was very light because you had suppressed it by continuously wearing the ring for over 2 months. so you should expect your next period about 4-5 weeks after the episode of spotting that you had. if you do not have menses by then, i recommend repeating the pregnancy test at that time. if you did not have regular monthly cycles before you used the ring, your cycle will follow your regular pattern that you typically have when not using hormonal contraception. if you are trying to get pregnant, you should have intercourse about every other day and begin taking prenatal vitamins as it benefits the health of the baby for the vitamins to be present at conception. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"i my period is late by a few weeks ( a have never been late before or ever missed a period ) , a still have lot of symptoms of being pregnant but 3 tests came negative . is there a chance that the tests could wrong ? please note a am note on birth control as me and my partner is trying for a baby .",1,28742,"hallow dear, before opining on your case, i would like to give you some scientific information about the fertile period. egg release (ovulation) takes place 14 days prior to the next expected menses. egg has a life of 24 hours while the sperms are active for 72 hours. hence, a period of a week around the ovulation is fertile period. so, if your menstrual cycle is of 30 days, day 16 is the ovulation day. thus, intercourse two weeks after the menstruation is very likely to be in the fertile period. before ejaculation, there is ejaculation secretion which also contains some sperms which are capable of fertilizing the egg. therefore, pull out technique is not a reliable method of birth control. you may please go for more reliable methods like birth control pills, condom or intrauterine device. your history suggests that there are good chances that you could be pregnant. now wait expectantly for the menses. if you miss them, for confirmation of diagnosis of pregnancy, you have the following options:1. pregnancy test on the overnight first morning urine sample 8-10 days after missed period. earlier these tests may give false negative results. 2. beta chat doctor tests are very sensitive and specific tests and give reliable results even few days before missing a period.3. ultrasonography 10 days after missing period.4. clinical examination 10 days after missing a period. if you are pregnant, and it is unwanted pregnancy, you may opt for medical termination of pregnancy up to 9 weeks of gestation after which you may need surgical procedure. i hope you have got the guidance."

after about 6 miles of running both quads start feeling like tiny electrical shocks . use to do this until a started electrolytes while running . did this while running over 12 -20 miles . just came off a 4 month recovery break for my knee and starting to run again . that is this ?,1,10540,"hi and welcome to chat doctor. i understand how it can be very challenging to pursue running with so much pain. the pain you have is due to a condition called, iliotibial band syn chat doctor. it occurs when the iliotibial band, the ligament that runs down the outside of the thigh from the hip to the shin, is tight or inflamed. the it band attaches to the knee and helps stabilize and move the joint. when the it band isn't working properly, movement of the knee (and, therefore, running) becomes painful. it band pain can be severe enough to completely sideline a runner for weeks, or even longer. here is a list of dos and don'ts that will surely help you! dos:1. the best way to get rid of it for good is to rest immediately. that means fewer miles, or no running at all. in the majority of runners, resting immediately will prevent pain from returning. if you don't give yourself a break from running, its can become chronic.2. while you're backing off on your mileage, you can cross-train. swimming, pool running, cycling, and rowing are all fine. stair-climbing is not, because it is too much like running3. when running on a track, change directions repeatedly and always do icing for minimum of 10 min to help reduce inflammation. 4. make sure your shoes aren't worn along the outside of the sole. if they are, replace them.5. walk a quarter- to half-mile before you start your runs. 6. see a physical therapist near you and get a few sessions of ultrasonic therapy. dots :1. don't run on concrete surfaces. i hope this information is helpful to you. take care and have a nice day :)"

a have been feeling unwell from last tue when a a sitting or standing suddenly for about 5 seconds a feel faint then it goes away a be had pins and needles on and of in my left leg and arm when this happens a feel as if my heart is racing like a a panicking ?,1,36160,hi. thanks for your query and an elucidated history. the lump at the back of the neck can not cause a direct problem of pins and needles in the arm. it is possible that the muscle spasm caused by this lump can indirectly cause nerve pressure or pinching. get fnac done of the lump and the mri should have been done to see if there is a protruding disc causing pressure on the spinal cord which causes the pins and needles feeling in the upper limb as you have. it is wise to get an opinion f a surgeon for the lump and of the neurologist for pins and needles sensation in the arm.

about a month ago a stopped taking my birth control pills that ave been taking for 4 years . now my period wont come and my vagina and the back of my thighs have a tingly feeling like its sleep . is all of this because of the pills ave stopped taking ?,1,74287,"hi there,if you are taking your birth control pill, very regularly and have thrown up after 45 minutes then there is no chance that you will be pregnant. this is assuming you are taking estrogen and progesterone pills. even if you are taking progesterone only pills, there is no chance that you are pregnant as you had taken pills regularly up till that day, and you have thrown up on the day after the sex. so do not worry at all. and you should continue taking the rest of the pills every day for the remaining part of the month. hope this helps. regards."
about a month ago a stopped taking my birth control pills that ave been taking for 4 years . now my period wont come and my vagina and the back of my thighs have a tingly feeling like its sleep . is all of this because of the pills ave stopped taking ?,2,27194,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. tri-sprintec is a birth control pill that has a traffic regimen; which means that each color pill in the package has a slightly different dose of hormones. occasionally, women who take traffic pills may have some spotting in the first few days after each pill strength changes over the course of the month. this may cause some slight bleeding or spotting when were not supposed to have your period. whenever you had vaginal bleeding, regardless of the cause, usually there is some cramping that accompanies it. furthermore, it is not unusual to have irregular bleeding or spotting in the first 3 months of pill use. both sprinter and tri-sprintec are considered low-dose birth control pills, however there are many brands on the market that have a lower dose of estrogen than the pill you are currently taking. so you may have less irregular bleeding and spotting on a different kind of monophasic (same dose all month) birth control pill. regarding pregnancy, the chance of your conceiving while taking birth control pills and using a condom is basically nonexistent. so i believe the symptoms you were experiencing are side effects due to the new birth control pill. if your desire is for lighter, regular periods, a different brand of monophasic pill may work better for you with fewer side effects. i hope i was able to adequately answer questions today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"hello , a have been taking mercilon for about a year and a half now and have never had problems , i have travelled with my husband and forgot to take my pill with me , the only pill i found here is marvelon , can a used it for a month instead of my original birth control ? and after i return to my country can a safely switch back to mercilon ? will a be unprotected ? are there any side effects ?",1,80020,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, the treatment of endometriosis with continuous birth control does help a lot of women with the pain associated with endometriosis. however, the side effects of bloating and breast tenderness can be due to the birth control, and the fact that you are taking them continuously compounds the symptoms over time. secondly, many women will have their period delayed after stopping birth control pills, especially if the pill has suppressed your period. so the fact that your cycle has not yet returned after stopping the yam is not unusual. even though you had bothersome side effects from the yam, there are many brands of birth control pills with different active ingredients that you can try to take for continuous use. the pill brands vary in name by the country in which you live, but a pill with the active ingredient levonorgestrel is the most popular type of extended cycle pill in the u.s. and i suggest you discuss changing to a brand with this active ingredient with your local physician. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

hi my one canine and one molar of right upper jaw are shaking and paining .... i am 36 yrs old . these teeth are entire also . a have undergone full dental a ray . it shows that the headache and pain in lower and upper jaw is due to wisdom teeth which has not erupted at all .,1,44241,"hello, i can understand your concern. it would have been easier to advise you if you had mentioned the pain is in the upper or lower jaw. i am answering for both possibilities. if it is in the lower jaw, it could be due to an impacted third molar, the wisdom tooth that is stuck in the jaw, trying to come out, but probably there is less physical space available for it to come out, so it is locked and causing pressure and pain in jaw and gums. to confirm this diagnosis, your dentist can take an x-ray (iowa) or you can go for opg (more preferable) that will show all teeth of your mouth. if the pain is in the upper jaw, third molar possibility can be considered for that, too. however, sometimes severe sinusitis can cause pain in upper teeth and gums. are you having symptoms of sinusitis, like cold, congestion, headache etc.? do u feel pain if pressed in the area below eye and around cheek area on left side? if yes, then this is the possibility, which can be solved by an ent specialist. taking a painkiller like ibuprofen 400 mg or acetaminophen 500 mg 8-hourly will help till diagnosis is made. i hope this advice helps you. thank you for choosing chat doctor. let me know if you have follow-up questions. best,"

(many couples seek help at six to nine months, though, which is fine if you're getting anxious about your failure to conceive.) having sex every day does not decrease your chances of getting pregnant. i hope that helps, and good luck!"

i was on birth control and at the end of july i started feeling like i was pregnant and my belly got bigger so i stop taking them well i had two period in sept and i missed last month and i have started yet i took home pregnancy test and it said no but i look like in pregnant and in sick to my belly and i done this with my last one can a help me,1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

(regular use of emergency pill is harmful)conception occurs if she was in 10th to 18th day of her cycle(in a regular cycle of 28 day duration). you can ask her at what day she is in and wait for next cycle to occur. if it delayed by 7 days then get done upt to diagnose if pregnant and then the required treatment can be taken. regards"

me and my boyfriend had unprotected sex may 31st 2015 my period came on the next day which was june 1st 2015 and today june 4th 2015 makes 3 days that a had my period and its off is there a possibility a could be pregnant ? could this be my last period ?,1,2330,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. unfortunately, ultrasound findings of the dating the pregnancy can be off for up to five days. so the changing of your due date by four days does not really change the possibility of your first partner having been the father of your baby. furthermore, sperm can remain alive in your genital tract for up to five days, and once you ovulate, the egg remains alive inside you for up to 72 hours. this is the reason that no test can accurately assess the date of conception based on the exact dates that you had intercourse. women typically ovulate two weeks before their period arrives. if you have a 28-day cycle, and your last period started on june 4, you likely ovulated around june 18. so either of the men you had sex with between the 15th and approximately the 20th could be the father of your baby. i hope that this information was helpful to you and that i was able to adequately answer your question even though it is not possible with medical science to determine the paternity of your pregnancy. i wish you the best of luck with your pregnancy and good health. best wishes,"

"i used the demo shot as birth control for 3 months ( 1 shot ) and never returned for my second shot in feb 2011 , i have been trying to conceive since feb 2012 and still no luck ! has the demo shot affected my fertility ? its starting to stress me out ! also when i came off the shot my periods returned after 2 months but i bled twice a month for about 4 months ? any help would be greatly appreciated .",1,47706,"hi, dont get worried reading unfounded stories. demo shot does not damage your fertility. although the demo shot needs to be repeated 12-16 weeks, when it is stopped usually it does not lose its effect in that time period. the effect can last longer because the microcrystals of depot injection sometimes dissolve very slowly. therefore, there is some delay in ovulation and conception. although pregnancy can occur as early as three and half months after the last shot, the average time for ovulation to start is about five and half months. but the time for becoming pregnant takes a little longer, the average being about 10 months from the last shot. for some women it may take up to 18 months. i hope i have answered your concerns. if you have any further queries, do contact me through chat doctor"

"a very dear friend of mine was having some luq pain , so he went to the doctor and they found his spleen to be slightly enlarged . in addition to that his of shows 2-3 rbcs in his urine , a slightly elevated anion gap and a think his mcvs were a little high as well . all other results on the cbc and dermatology were normal . be also consumes at least one energy drink everyday , and takes no medicines . is of is borderline . a am concerned that it may be some kind of lymphoma .",1,100031,"the major concern with this ultrasound is the cirrhotic liver with ascites. when the liver is badly damaged with scarring (cirrhosis), it doesn't work very well. blood flowing through the scarred liver gets backed up and creates high pressure in the liver, which in turn results in fluid leaking in to the abdomen (ascites). unfortunately, cirrhosis with ascites may be an indication that his liver is starting to fail. the kidney shows that a stone is present, but that does not seem to be causing any problems. no other findings are of significance. what needs to be done now is to take a sample of the ascites fluid and determine if it is truly related to the liver cirrhosis or something else. liver disease is the most common cause of ascites, but other conditions may cause it as well, and treatment may differ. further investigation of the liver status may also be needed, such as a biopsy. usually the spleen is enlarged when ascites develops with a cirrhotic liver, and his spleen is normal, so perhaps another more treatable condition is present. liver failure from cirrhosis is the worst case scenario. further evaluation should help define his situation better. hope this helps."

hi this is my 1st pregnancy & i had sex during ovulation & 13 days after ovulation i started 2 spot at 1st it was pink then brown then fresh red blood my uterus is sore & i have all my pregnancy symptoms i also bleed again this month & it was spotty for 5 days with cramping around my hips & i was just wondering where or what could be causing the blood ?,1,87829,"hif you have had sex on the ovulation day, then pregnancy test can be done on the 7th day after sex. the logic is implantation of baby into uterus occurs on the 6th-7th day after ovulation. with implantation, pregnancy hormone is secreted, and it can be detected by tests. this is the earliest time to do pregnancy test. urine test may not detect it. you need to do blood pregnancy test. so only when you have sex at the time /just after ovulation pregnancy test can be done after 6-7 days. what you have heard is right. the first week and the last week of a menstrual cycle are safe. a woman cannot get pregnant if she has unprotected sex during this period. i hope i have answered your concerns."

a took four pregnancy tests and they all came out positive . a was having abdominal pains so a went to the hospital . they say a have a dermoid cyst on my right fallopian tube and that a still may be pregnant but they can to tell yet . the doctor said the cyst can be causing my hormones to rise . be said my hormone level was at 200 .,1,35396,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. if you have not yet missed your period, even if you are pregnant, the line will appear very faint on the pregnancy test as your hormone levels are extremely low at this time in pregnancy. so there is no reason to assume that the test was wrong as the greatest likelihood is that you are actually pregnant. however, women can have a situation where they have a positive pregnancy test and then get their normal period on time. this is known as a chemical pregnancy and is caused by the situation where the egg is fertilized but never implants into the uterus and continues to grow. so i encourage patients in general to try to avoid performing pregnancy test before they actually miss their period, as even though you have a positive pregnancy test this early, it does not guarantee that the pregnancy is going to take. if your cycle is late, there is no reason to assume that there is any problem with the pregnancy. if you do retest after you miss your period and the line is still very weekly positive, it may be reasonable to see a physician and get a blood test for the level of your pregnancy hormone. pregnancy hormone levels are supposed to double every 48 hours so by the time you miss your period the levels should be significantly high enough to produce a clear double line on the pregnancy test especially if you perform it with your first morning urine as recommended. low hormone levels in early pregnancy can indicate that the pregnancy is not developing properly or that it can be an ectopic or tubal pregnancy, which needs to be diagnosed and accurately managed by a physician. in the meantime however, i encourage you to stop chat doctor. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes and good luck with the pregnancy,"

"a accidentally bit into my cheek while chewing gum about a week ago . now there is flap of skin where a bit . it a not swollen , hot/warm , or a cold sore ( from what a can tell ) . it did to start hurting until 4 days ago and the pain is similar to the stingy pain of a cut cheek from wearing braces . a need to know if a need to go to the dentist to get it checked out because the flap has not gone down at all and only increases in pain .",1,57293,"hi. welcome to chat doctor. as per your complaint it seems that you have inflammation of the gum flap surrounding the wisdom tooth and the condition is known as peritonitis. pericoronitis occurs if food gets lodged between wisdom tooth and the gum flap covering the wisdom tooth... and by food it does not mean that you see big food particles stuffed in there, but it also means uncleaned area and bacterial growth below gum flap... it leads to inflammation of the flap leading to pain swelling and as the area lies close to the throat there can be sore throat and swollen lymph nodes. but pain in the tooth in front of the wisdom tooth can be infection or decay in second molar tooth. the line of treatment is antibiotics, painkillers, mouthwash but only this is not enough to you, you should go to dentist again and ask him to irrigate the area between gum flap and wisdom tooth with saline, betadine solution and hy chat doctor. . other thing is done warm saline gargles, it will help you to reduce inflammation... carry on with the course of your antibiotics and painkillers, your pain and swelling must go in two three days. once you get relieved of your discomfort visit the dentist again and get an iop ar (x-ray) done to find out whether wisdom tooth will erupt to proper occlusion or is impacted (means having an obstruction and won't erupt to occlusion). if it is not impacted just get your gum flap removed known as operculectomy and if impacted get your tooth extracted... this will be your ultimate treatment and finish your problem forever. if the second molar tooth is also decayed leading to pain you can get root canal treatment done to save the tooth and resolve infection. hope you recover soon. thanks and regards."

hi my niece is 4 years old and she is suffering from bleeding problems . her gums are not stronger enough even when she eats chips blood start to come out from her gums . i shall be grateful to all of a if a help us out from this problem,2,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

a have had sinus surgery about 2 months ago . last month a developed a chronic cough that keeps me up half the night . it a not bad during the day . now a have a taste of diesel exhaust/ kerosene in my mouth and sinus . there is it coming from and how do a get rid of it ?,1,22667,"dear patient, i can understand your concern and feel sorry for the pain you are suffering from. you are informing me that when you got the upper molar extracted, the dentist told you that the bone between the sinus and tooth is destroyed and sinus cavity is open. roots of upper molar often are found inside the maxillary sinus, which causes opening of the sinus cavity while extraction of the tooth, creating an oro-antral fistula, that is a direct connection between oral cavity and sinus cavity. in this case, the food or water you take has chances of passing infection in the sinus through mouth and the infection does not resolve. it is mandatory to close this connection between mouth and the sinus. it could be done by the dentist by taking stitches in the area when he found that sinus has opened, but it can also be done now. however, as about 2 weeks has passed since extraction, the opening would not be as much clear as it would have been during extraction. a blood clot may have filled the area. so what you need to do now is, go to an oral surgeon or an ent specialist. i know you have insurance problem, but there seems no other solution to your problem. you might have to go for x-rays and probably ct scan of the area to diagnose if oro-antral fistula actually exists and if it does, you might have to go for a little surgery to close the communication between mouth and sinus followed by antibiotics to resolve the infection. i hope this information helps. thank you for choosing chat doctor. i wish you get well soon. best,"

"i . today a was playing football at school and usually when the person with the ball gives it to their quarterback , we run at eachother . well , a was blocking a person with his fist pointing out and we were both running at eachother at full speed and the fist socked me hard in the stomach . now a feel like a have trouble breathing and am sort of getting dizzy .",1,41571,"hello, unfortunately for physicians ""shaking"" is a very vague term, and it could mean many kinds of movements, ranging from tremulousness of the body, to flailing, to arrhythmic shaking to rhythmic shaking and all have very different implications. however, i will give you the most common cause of what you saw. most likely what occurred is called ""convulsive syncope"" which means that when you pass out you have some jerking movements, but it is not considered a seizure. what happens is that blood flow is disrupted to the brain and the person loses consciousness. because the nerve cells are suddenly deprived of oxygen, they fire abnormally for a few times causing body jerking, but when the person collapses blood flow is restored and the movements stop. so essentially the movements are caused by passing out and not by a seizure. likely what happened also was what we call a ""vasovagal reaction"" in which due to stress, emotional response among other things, the blood vessels dilate and blood rushed down from the head into the legs causing a person to pass out. the classic example of this is when a person who is getting their blood chat doctor. it is not considered abnormal, and can happen to anybody. lastly, just to describe what a true seizure looks like. typically, what happens is that a person will first stiffen up, the eyes will turn up into the head with the eyes remaining open. there is often a very loud scream due to the abdominal muscles tensing up and expelling air from the lungs. the stiffening phase is then followed by a rhythmic, whole body shaking. when i say rhythmic i mean that the jerks occur at regular intervals and at the same time in all extremities of the body. the gradually slow down and the person becomes limp and often is breathing very hard. when they wake up there is almost always confusion that lasts several minutes and then slowly the person returns to their normal state of mind. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"by almost 5 year old grand daughter has a skin condition on her face . the or a are saying it is impetigo . it is not scabby , but looks red almost like a fungus . the has allergies and asthma . they have treated her with antibiotics etc . the color is between pink and light red and around her mouth and under nose . is there something they could be missing . the also had allergic reaction to peaches . someone had eaten a peach she came in contract with . they treated her for that first and then said it turned into patio .",1,14427,"hey there, thank you for your question and welcome to chat doctor. first off, why is your daughter having difficulty breathing? is it due to the nasal congestion or because her tonsils are enlarged? the sound that she makes while sleeping could be due to the stuffy nose. she is having to compensate for air so she's mouth breathing. you are probably also hearing chest congestion if she has a cold. if you hear a high pitch whistle sound called wheezing, then i would recommend a visit back to the doctor to make sure her airway isn't being affected by her swollen tonsils. the medications that you listed are exactly what i would want to see given to her. strep throat is treated with antibiotics and that is what the literal is for. remember, with any antibiotics, it will take 2-3 days before her symptoms start to resolve. the fever, sore throat and ulcers will usually still be present during the first 24-36 hours. the two other medications you listed are to make her comfortable in terms of her nasal congestion and other cold symptoms. i would have to agree with the doctor who prescribed the medications and say that it is a good treatment plan. hopefully your little one will start to feel better quickly. have a good day!"

year or . a have been trying to conceive for some time now.my doctor prescribed metro to be taken from day 2 to by 7 and follicular study from day 8.i went for the study today and the report says that the left ovary has multiple follicles with the largest one being 12.8mm.should i go on day 10 also ? will what day should i go for the follicular study ? today is day 8 .,1,13108,"hi, i appreciate your query would clarify the report of your follicular study to you. on the 9th day, in the right and left ovaries (of and lof) - there was no df - which means, dominant follicle. again the same findings persisted till the 13th day, that is there was no dominant follicle in any of the ovaries. et - refers to endometrial thickness which was 8 mm on day 13. collection in pod was nil, which is normal. now, to explain a normal follicular study to you. by day 9, the ovaries start producing dominant follicles, that is among the many eggs present in the ovaries, one starts maturing to develop into the dominant egg for that month. by day 13 generally, if you have a regular 28-day menstrual cycle, the dominant egg reaches a size of 20 - 22 mm. generally on day 14, ovulation occurs, that is the mature dominant egg is released from the ovary, and it is then ready for fertilization by the sperm. this is the normal studyhowever, in your case, there is no dominant follicle seen till day 13, which means that you are having an ovulatory cycle. that is, no mature egg is developing for ovulation this month. anovulatory cycles are a major cause for not being able to conceive.pod (polycystic ovarian disease) is one of the leading causes of an ovulation, apart from other conditions. you need to consult a gynecologist, and undergo further investigations for pod to rule out the cause of this follicular study. also, you might require treatment and ovulation induction (medicines to stimulate formation of follicles in the ovary). in case your cycles are delayed (longer than 28 - 30 days), there is a minor possibility that your follicles are maturing later than normal, for e.g., in a 35-day cycle, the day of ovulation would be 14 days before periods, that is on day 20 or 21. hope this helped you."

"i sir a have enlarged spleen problem , the size is 12 pm in ugs examination , a am.supposed to consult with dermatologist but here in.my city there is to dermatologist , so whom to consult in this case . and any suggestion from a regarding this problem . thanking you",1,35681,"hi!, welcome to chat doctor forum, according to your history, it seems that you have plasma, since you quoted that you are not on oral contraceptive pills, and you have not had any issues either. these questions you would have faced by many doctors. it is true that such pigmentation is often seen after pregnancy or one who is on ocs. but we have been seeing such pigmentation on those who have not had such a history either. so, even if you never had a baby, one can have such pigmentation problem, just because of slight shift in the hormones in the body. it is the estrogen level in the blood which is more responsible for such pigmentation. if this is plasma, we are dealing with a very chronic problem. it can wax and vain also. sunlight & stress also has a big role to play. the best advise here would be to use a triple combination cream to begin with, and then gradually taper it off.don't use it for more than 2 weeks. as you taper it gradually starts using hy chat doctor. along with this also start using comic acid & it c based creams in day and evening. but please don't forget to use a good spf sunscreen daily thrice. sunscreen is mandatory. you can even undergo chemical peeling from an experienced dermatologist. results of this all might vary from patient to patient. now being a laser expert i've myself done the number of cases with lasers too. the best of the laser for this is q-switched nd:yag laser. but one cannot guarantee you any great results with this either. the results are variable here too. and its costly also. plasma has always been a very frustrating problem both for the patient and the treating doctor. it is one thing which can destroy the reputation of most reputed doctor. so, have patience and kindly consult a dermatologist for this. please do not take any beauty parlor treatment for this. this is one possibility what came in my mind. secondly it might be freckles too since you said you have spots all over your face. lasers is best for treating freckles. you may require only one sitting for this. kindly consult an experienced dermatologist who can diagnose and treat your problem. i hope this answers your query, if you any further questions, kindly write back to us. regards,"

"i dr.sjjknk , first of all a am not a runner and a have not fallen , a have pain on the outer part of my ankle like if a did fall and sprain it but truly a did not . a am worried , what could be wrong a can walk to a certain extent and a a in pain when a do walk .",1,2655,"hi, thanks for contacting chat doctor. in cases like yours with an ankle sprain and then continued pain, it is most likely that there was some soft tissue damage on the structures that support the ankle joint itself. there is a ligament and two tendons on the outside of the ankle that are the main stabilizers, and these structures can get stretched, partially torn, or completely torn with a sprain. most times, these will scar back down and continue to support the ankle. other times, they will not be able to do the job as they did before and will have to work ""overtime"" to do the same job. this area then gets inflamed and painful, especially after a full day of trying to stabilize the joint (being on the feet all day). it is wise to start out with an ankle brace and see if that helps the area, as the brace can do the job of these soft tissue structures and give them a break to help decrease inflammation/pain. i hope this answer helped, if you have any further questions, i am here to help. thank you."

of ave lost my whole back top molar and can still feel prices of the tooth but that not the problem a keep getting this bubble on my gum right next to the tooth it hurts pretty bad but a can stick my finger in my mouth and just barley touch it and it pops a a guess pus comes out of it . to you have any answers on how to get rid of it and what is causing it since a done have the money to see a dentist right now . thank you,1,53390,hi. can understand your concern. as per your complaint the swollen gum and the white material inside it is a result of some inflammation. there can be a few reasons depending upon whether it is the second molar or the wisdom tooth. in case it is a wisdom tooth which is erupting or is impacted then the gum above it can get infected and inflamed due to either food deposition between the gum and the wisdom tooth or it can be due to gum flap bitten by the opposite jaw tooth and the condition is known as peritonitis. the white material in it is pus. in case it is second molar the swollen gum with white material in it can be as a result of infection in the gums due to deposits on the teeth like plaque or calculus or due to foreign body impaction in the gums which carries infection along with it deeper into the gums causing pus formation. it can also be due to deeply infected tooth causing pus formation below the tips of the roots of the tooth causing swelling on the gums with pus inside. i would suggest you to consult a dentist and get evaluated for the exact cause of the swelling and get treated accordingly. in case if it is wisdom tooth either excision of gum flap or extraction if the tooth is impacted followed by antibiotics and painkillers can be done. in case of gum infection professional cleaning of teeth followed by antibiotics and gum paints can help. in case of tooth infection root canal treatment or extraction depending on the condition of the tooth can be done. hope your query is solved. if you find the answer helpful please write a positive review and click on find this answer helpful as a token of appreciation. thanks and regards. chat doctor.

"a broke my ankle and had to have surgery on my ankle they put 6 screws and a plate . a month after a get these random cramps in my foot and they hurt if feels as if a can to move my toe , it happens on the left and on the right side of my foot . a was just curious as to what you think a should do ?",1,32860,"hi, so you had an ankle fracture and had surgery and there is a plate with 6 screws. this will be mostly on the outer side of the ankle where there is a thin bone called the fibula. when the ankle breaks there is injury to the bone, the ligaments attached the tissues around and also to two small nerves which runs along the inner and outer side of the foot. these nerves can be stretched and this could be the cause of the feeling of cramps. apart from that the surgery and subsequent swelling all will result in some stiffness. please exercise your ankle by moving it in all planes several times a day. try to get rid of swelling by using compressive socks, icing,and using local cream applications for swelling. keep the limb elevated while at rest. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further. take care"

"a have recently discovered a lump on the inner part of my left breast . it a pretty big for a lump and the first time a squeezed it , a considerable amount of pimple-like pus came out . now the lump is still there , no more pus coming out , and it a tender to the touch . it does to feel the same as breast tissue and i a nervous about it .",1,82366,"hello friend, thank you for posting your query through chat doctor. i am a homeopath answering your query and the answer which i am going to give you may contain several thoughts which may appear strange or new for you. this i say because homeopathy is a new system of medicine and is almost unheard by the majority of the population. therefore, due to the high influence of the conventional medicine the people at large are brainwashed to believe and act according to the health education given by them. coming back to the fibroadenoma of your left breast in the year 1979, you had a psychological conflict in the mind level. you are a sensitive individual and that is why your left breast was affected. it must have been related with your child chat doctor. the sensitivity is genetic, and you reacted to the conflict through the brain according to a genetic programming. mind-brain - organ affection resulted in the development of a lump in your left breast in 1979. you consulted your gynecologist, and he suggested that it may turn to become cancerous in future and so it is better to remove it, and you subdued to his suggestion. actually the lump in the breast was an attempt of the body to cure you, or it was the result of a self defense mechanism. since you had not resolved the conflict in the psychological level, the lump remained there without getting resolved. but the body kept the lump protected in a cyst with minimum amount of inflammation called chronic cystitis. by removing the fibroadenoma or chronic cystic mastitis, you were not cured, but your lump in the breast was removed. in 1995 also you are the same person, you are the same sensitive person, and you underwent another more serious psychological conflict and the same left breast was again affected in a more serious manner. instead of recognizing the mass as a defense mechanism, you got the fear in you that you have cancer. the tissue changes also suggested that there is more serious pathology, and they labelled your lump this time as cancer and suggested removal of your left breast. if you could have recognized the lump as a defense mechanism and if you had no fear of cancer, you could have retained your breast. but the fear of cancer is such that it is associated with death and so you lost your breast. in no case, either by removal of lump in 1979 or by removal of your breast in 1995, you are not cured only your disease is cured. hope by this time you have got the answer for your query. both are related to each other because they are in the same individual, same sensitivity, same program. homeopathy cures the person and once the individual is cured all his diseases will be cured. with best wishes,"

"a few weeks ago a was hospitalized for sob , chest pain radiating to my back . completed a series of tests ( stress test , ekg , egd & colonoscopy ) of which all came find . last night a suddenly began having chest pain in the center of my chest along with breaking out in a sweat , nausea , leg weakness , headache and low grade fever . the chest pain is sharp and feels like something is lodged or blocking something . a called my primary care and he suggested the of . any thoughts on what could going on ?",1,41649,"hello. thank you for your question and welcome to chat doctor. i understand your concern. well, i am going to try and explain the differences between various origins of the pain which can arise from the rib cage. there is angina. it is described more like mid-chest heaviness or squeezing sensation, that is triggered by exercise and relieved by rest, which radiates to the both sides of the chest, to the jaw and left arm and shoulder. it is indicative of a blockage within one or more coronary arteries and reflects the lowering of blood supply to the heart muscle. an ekg obtained in the moment of chest pain, if it fills this description, would be helpful. then there is pleuritic chest pain. this kind of pain is sharp, stabbing pain that can happen in any part of the chest area. no radiation like in anginal pain. it arises from acute or chronic inflammation of the linings that are within the rib cage: pleura (lining of the lungs) or pericardium (lining of the heart) or both. in this regard, i would recommend a chest x-ray for pleural inflammation or effusion. in case of pericardial pain and anginal pain, echocardiogram is helpful, by evaluating the size, motility and function of heart muscle and valves, and also by assessing the pericardium and whether there is fluid build-up within it, or not. other causes of chest pain are related to the locomotion system of the rib cage: muscle soreness, bone and cartilage-related pain. in the end, stress can also cause chest pain. i hope i was helpful with my answer. best regards,"

"a had arthroscopic surgery on my wrist tuesday under general anastasia . a was fine post . today hand is really swollen and now am getting a scratchy / itchy feeling in my throat and lips . is this normal ? a have only a taken tylenol for pay , and just took 25mg benadryl .",1,52955,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. in the first trimester of pregnancy, your ovaries produce the hormone progesterone which normally is made by the placenta once it reaches adequate size. so it is not unusual in the first trimester pregnancy to feel pain in your ovaries. in addition, as your uterus stretches, you also may experience some cramping and pulling sensations, which can be on the sides. the only thing that is concerning is if you have not had an ultrasound this pregnancy to confirm that it is normal and located in your uterus. if you already have had an ultrasound for this pregnancy it is unlikely that there could be anything harmful going on, especially if you are not bleeding. so if the pain is severe enough that you cannot function, especially if you have not yet had an ultrasound, if you cannot reach her doctor within a reasonable amount of time, you may want to pursue care in an emergency setting. if you have had a normal ultrasound earlier in this pregnancy, you really do not need to worry, as your ovaries are normally examined as part of your pregnancy ultrasound and a large cyst would've already been detected. tylenol, or acetaminophen is safe to use for pain at the normal adult dosage during all trimesters of pregnancy, and you can try to see if that helps with the pain. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

(as you said he has difficulty in walking now). you can also say to his parents that --- they can continue with all religious customs along with medicines, may be then they will agree... with medicine, he will start showing improvement in few days only... it is psychosis and patients will not agree to go to any doctor willingly, so you might need to take him forcefully. this is well accepted as it is for his benefit only. even if he doesn't agree for oral medicine there are injectables which are given to such patients... take the right step, take him to a doctor. hope the reply is useful feel free to ask more questions"

"a be been taking cipralex for anxiety for almost a year . a am currently taking 20mg/day and have recently noticed an elevation in glucose levels , and am having trouble controlling them . blood pressure is elevated lately as well . would this be due to the cipralex ? is there another anti-anxiety medication that is more blood sugar-friendly ?",1,32972,"hello, cipralex may indeed cause blood glucose disorders and blood pressure disorders, although both are rare. it may cause both hypo- and hyper- glycemic (the effect cannot be individually predicted) and both hypo- and hypertension. such side effects occur in less than 1% of patients taking 20 mg of circle. it has to be even less likely in patients who have been taking it for a year without any side effects. perhaps your doctor should try to identify other potential causes for your problems. weight gain and sedentary lifestyle are inciting factors for hyperglycemia, although genetics play a major role in it - some individuals will never develop diabetes no matter how fat they become, others will experience hyperglycemia even when they stay lean. the same factors are important for hypertension as well. salt consumption is another important factor in this regard. checking your glucosylated hemoglobin would be recommended. high glucosylated hemoglobin may indicate that treatment for diabetes might be necessary... regarding your blood pressure. measuring your blood pressure (at least twice each time) for at least one week will give your doctor a better idea about it. 24-hour blood pressure monitoring (holder) may be even more accurate in detecting blood pressure issues. so in conclusion, i don't believe that these symptoms are caused by circle - although i can't 100% exclude it. an investigation is required to determine the extent of these issues and whether treatment is required or not. i wouldn't recommend any change to your regimen without discussing the matter with your doctor first. consequently, i wouldn't recommend any other antianxiety medication. a rate of less than 1% for side effects is perfect for any chat doctor."

"hello.my name is michael and i am trying for for than 6 months to get pregnant , i have 26 years and my husband is 28.we have been to the or she gave us some vitamins like : fertilcare for him , and for me pregnant care and wellness .after that i took ova-mit for 5 days , twice a day , and we have been trying to get pregnant for about one month but nothing yet ! what i can do ? the or said we have to make some analysis to see if we are of , but is very expensive to us i feel some cramps in abdomen down in the night only it can be sorting or is it my imagination only ? thank you very much",1,43820,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, i want to reassure you that no matter what your endometrial measurement may be, 80% of couples will conceive within one year naturally. couples are not diagnosed as infertile until you have been trying and been unable to become pregnant for over one year. endometrial thickness is really only relevant in the context of couples trying to get pregnant through in vitro fertilization. the thickness of your uterine lining is somewhat related to your estrogen levels. when couples are undergoing ivf, treating with additional estrogen can thicken the uterine lining. however, because you've been only trying to get pregnant for four months, your endometrial lining may have absolutely nothing to do with the reason why you have not yet conceived. furthermore, unless your husbands' sperm count has been shown to be decreased, magazine should not have any effect on fertility nor should affect any health of a developing baby should you conceive. medications taken during pregnancy by the mother can affect the fetus, but not any medication taken by the father, because medication cannot be transmitted before fertilization through sperm. so unless the medication causes the sperm count to be low or abnormal, there is no medical reason why your husband needs to be off his medication for colitis in order for you and need to conceive successfully. i suggest that if he needs the medication for his health that he continue to take it. as for is maximizing your chance of healthy pregnancy, the best thing you can do is get plenty of sleep, eat a well-balanced diet, take prenatal vitamins, and tried to have regular(at least 2 to 3 days a week) unprotected intercourse from the time your menstrual period finishes until you begin to feel premenstrual symptoms. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and i wish you and your husband the best of luck in conceiving. best wishes,"

"a am in the 9th week of pregnancy . be did an ultrasound last week and it was said that there is a choriodecidual separation of 25 % and some bleeding around the pregnancy . so i was asked to take austen 200g injections once every week . and also naturogest 200 my twice daily . its not only making me very sick , a am worried that its too much of hormones that is being given to me . is this dosage right ? a was also given an anti a injection as my blood group is a the negative . a am also on 100mcg eltroxin and 500mg xiamen ( metformin ) from before . a am really concerned as i have conceived after 6 years of marriage . please advice .",1,40763,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the clearblue test is not very accurate in predicting gestational age. the amount of pregnancy hormone in a women urine can vary depending on the time of day she did the test and how much water she had to chat doctor. furthermore, many women have some bleeding in the first trimester of pregnancy, so the bleeding she had in december and january may not have been her real period at all. the most accurate way to test the age of a pregnancy, is an ultrasound exam to measure the fetus. this is normally done during the course of her routine prenatal care. an ultrasound is also necessary to determine if there is more than one fetus present. in your sisters case, if she conceived in november, the measurements of her uterus at this point would be accurate. so i would recommend that she have an ultrasound exam (which i am sure will be done soon as part of her routine prenatal care) to confirm her due date and the viability of the pregnancy. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes to your sister for her pregnancy,"

by four year old son jus had a hernia survey about a mounts ago and today he used the restroom and it seemed like it was blood in his stool the stool was solid and brown at first as it continued it started to look softer and begin looking red there was what seemed like street blood peeking to the bottom of the toilet what stool was red was solid . but softer then other stool,1,38727,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. one of the ways that you can possibly figure out where the bleeding is coming from is by putting a tampon inside. if, while wearing the tampon, you still see blood on your underwear then the bleeding is coming from your rectum. in that case, there is less to worry about as it is most likely from your hemorrhoids. to reduce the chances of your hemorrhoids causing bleeding, eat lots of fruits and vegetables and chat doctor. this will not harm the baby, but will rather make your stool softer said it is easier for you to have a bowel movement. if the tampon has blood on it than the bleeding definitely is coming from vagina. a small amount of bleeding can happen during late pregnancy as your cervix starts to soften to eventually prepare for labor. however, this type of blood should be dark brown or purple and mixed with mucus. if you are having bright red blood coming from your vagina, i would call your doctor for advice. if you have any risk factors for bleeding during pregnancy; such as being on blood thinners, having a low-lying or placenta prefix, or experiencing any other symptoms like uterine contractions it might be prudent for you to go to an emergency room for evaluation. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"
