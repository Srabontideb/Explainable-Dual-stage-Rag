"i a am 22 , a noticed a small pea size little lump or even a ball of tissue perhaps it could be , under my knee by my ligament . and it does move and it is painless . it is not very palpable , a sort of have to find it to palpate it . should a be concerned ?",1,33931,"hi michele jacobi the first thing that has to be done once you find a lump in the region of the chest wall is to confirm what it is. in your case a biopsy has already been done and let us await its result. you're understanding that cancerous lumps don't bleed after biopsy is correct. but i think your presumption that if it was scar tissue it would have bled is not correct. scar tissue also need not bleed. needle biopsies do not usually cause any bleeding unless a blood vessel is ruptured during the procedure since how long have you noticed this lump. is the size of the lump increasing ? if the biopsy comes as positive for cancer then you will have to undergo a series of investigation to find out he the extent of the disease. ? whether it is confined to the chest wall only or whether it has gone beyond the chest wall to other regions. treatment decision will depend on the results of this if the biopsy comes as negative for cancer then there are 2 options 1- if your physician thinks it is insignificant then you need to follow it up. just keep a check on your lump to see whether it is increasing in size and also get it checked by your physician regularly2- the second option (and my preference) is to do an open biopsy especially if the lump was detected recently and is increasing in size and also if the lump is firm to hard (and not very soft). the reason is needle biopsy can be negative, but this does not always mean there is no cancer especially if the tissue sample taken is not adequate. also time factor is important. you may lose time keeping the lump under follow up to see whether it is increasing in size hope you are satisfied with my reply. anyway don't worry. follow your doctors' advice chat doctor."

since last year i meant 2014 march . a have been having is problem when i go to bed sometime i will found myself wet .... i was thinking that it a just a sign of heat unknown that is my sperm that comets out every night part from that if i want to make love to a woman . sperm equally kick too am highly frustrated in my life ..... a a seeking for help and better solution .... a grow up with one scrotum i don to really know it was the causes,1,37527,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. even though your boyfriends penis was inside you for only a short time, sperm can be present in pre-ejaculate (or pre-cum) and if you truly do not want to become pregnant it is really important to avoid any contact of the penis with your vagina during sexual play. the most fertile time of a woman cycle is in the middle, typically 14 days before your menstrual period would be due. so the time from when your period finishes until you start to feel pms symptoms is your fertile time. so in this case, since your boyfriend did not ejaculate, it still would be quite rare for you to have conceived. the most common sign of pregnancy is a late or delayed menstrual period. so in your case, you just need to wait for your period to arrive, and if it is late, you can do an over-the-counter urine pregnancy test which is greater than 99% accurate. pregnancy test do not become positive however until at least 2 to 3 weeks after conception. so in summary, your chances of having gotten pregnant in your particular situation is very, very low. for the future, please make sure that the penis is completely covered with a condom if it has any contact with the opening of your vagina. as long as the area is moist, sperm can swim all the way up your vagina from the opening and result in pregnancy. however, the amount of sperm in pre-cum is extremely low, so again i doubt that you need to be concerned about this one sexual encounter. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was helpful. best wishes,"

"by son is 12 year a old , and he is tired all the time . even on weekend s. when he was about 8 year a old he had asthma so his doctor had him use the nebulizer 3 times a day . when he turned 10 his asthma seemed to get better , so we stopped the nebulizer and he just used the inhaler during school only for p.e . i done know if stopping the nebulizer had anything to do with him being tired all the time . but family members/friends have noticed that he is always tired as well . my son has told me after he uses the inhaler that he seems to have more energy after . he also has said that his heart beats fast when he is just sitting down for no reason . i took him to the or for a physical a few days ago and his lab results came back normal . if a can give me advice on what to do that be great . thanks .",1,45065,"hi there, i understand your concern, and i would like to assure you that the montage is appropriate for him at this time. montage, or montelukast can be taken for allergies and asthma both as a relief and maintenance therapy. it all depends on how long he will be exposed to the allergens. in fact, it would suit him if it is very clearly a seasonal type allergy, because then he can take it throughout the pollen season, and stop it the rest of the year. what the other doctor means is that it is not appropriate for immediate rescue the way a nebulizer can be used, because it takes a few hours to even be absorbed. if your son is very breathless, it probably will not work fast enough, much like how an antihistamine is not meant to stop the allergy immediately. you should find that adding on montage will make him need the nebulizer less frequently, because it brings down the general level of allergic reaction in the body. i will repeat that it is not meant to replace the nebulizer, which is a short term rescue solution when he is breathless. hopefully, just decreasing the need for nebulizers will make his allergy more manageable through the season. hope this helps, and all the best to you."

a had a root canal on my front tooth and had a blister on my gum over the tooth next to it . ave been taking reflex for a week but see little improvement .. the dentist also opened it up .. just wondering how long it takes to heal .. ave been rinsing with warm salt water too .,1,110413,"dear sir/ mam, i understand your problem. root canal treatment is removing the decayed nerve and blood vessels from the root. once it's done your tooth become lifeless. thereeafteryou will not have any kind of sense (pain or sensitivity)in that tooth. but to prevent chipping of root canal treated tooth it's always advisable to get a cap or crown for it. since your tooth hole is opened for a long time without a filling or crown, adjacent gum tissue would have grown into it, becoming red as you chew food particles on it. in rare case, the filling material even from root would have come out and the remnant pupal tissue would have developed into a pupal polyp (painless growth of pupal tissue). whatever the reason for the growing tissue, its absolutely treatable. you may need a re- rct if its pupal polyp or else just cut the gum tissue growth (painless with lasers)and fill the tooth. absolutely nothing to worry. hope your query is answered. for further queries please don't hesitate to contact back."

"hello , in july 2013 i had lump in my left breast and had fnac done result came out as cyst.i had also done mambo and mri for both breasts in aug 2013 and result was 2 small cysts in right breast and 6 small to medium cysts in left breast.iam not talking any medicines except avion 600 and multivitamin.i sometimes have left breast pain ( not severe ) , but sometimes worries me.pain transfers to right shoulder too.is something i have to worry , please advise ....",1,82366,"hello friend, thank you for posting your query through chat doctor. i am a homeopath answering your query and the answer which i am going to give you may contain several thoughts which may appear strange or new for you. this i say because homeopathy is a new system of medicine and is almost unheard by the majority of the population. therefore, due to the high influence of the conventional medicine the people at large are brainwashed to believe and act according to the health education given by them. coming back to the fibroadenoma of your left breast in the year 1979, you had a psychological conflict in the mind level. you are a sensitive individual and that is why your left breast was affected. it must have been related with your child chat doctor. the sensitivity is genetic, and you reacted to the conflict through the brain according to a genetic programming. mind-brain - organ affection resulted in the development of a lump in your left breast in 1979. you consulted your gynecologist, and he suggested that it may turn to become cancerous in future and so it is better to remove it, and you subdued to his suggestion. actually the lump in the breast was an attempt of the body to cure you, or it was the result of a self defense mechanism. since you had not resolved the conflict in the psychological level, the lump remained there without getting resolved. but the body kept the lump protected in a cyst with minimum amount of inflammation called chronic cystitis. by removing the fibroadenoma or chronic cystic mastitis, you were not cured, but your lump in the breast was removed. in 1995 also you are the same person, you are the same sensitive person, and you underwent another more serious psychological conflict and the same left breast was again affected in a more serious manner. instead of recognizing the mass as a defense mechanism, you got the fear in you that you have cancer. the tissue changes also suggested that there is more serious pathology, and they labelled your lump this time as cancer and suggested removal of your left breast. if you could have recognized the lump as a defense mechanism and if you had no fear of cancer, you could have retained your breast. but the fear of cancer is such that it is associated with death and so you lost your breast. in no case, either by removal of lump in 1979 or by removal of your breast in 1995, you are not cured only your disease is cured. hope by this time you have got the answer for your query. both are related to each other because they are in the same individual, same sensitivity, same program. homeopathy cures the person and once the individual is cured all his diseases will be cured. with best wishes,"

"hello , my dad got paralysed from the left side of the body and doctors say that there is a blood cloth in the brain which we take 6- 8 months to get recover right now doctor had prescribed some medicines and ask to call physiotherapist now everyday the physiotherapist comes and make dad do some exercise . would a plus tell me the fastest way to get him recover",1,109169,"hi there there are a lot of things to explain in this but ill try to explain you in short so that you can understand. heart has two sides right and the left, right side of the heart receives used blood that returns from the body parts and right ventricles pump this blood to lungs to supply it with oxygen again and to make it reusable to the tissues now this oxygenated blood is returned from the lungs to left heart which pumps it back to whole body. that's how circulation is completed. now coming to your sons case, right ventricle (rv) can dilate due to various reasons and we summaries them in two scenarios pressure and volume overload. pressure overload happens when there is some sort of resistance in the normal blood flow as some lung pathology and volume overload is due to extra amount of blood entering the right side of the circulation from some abnormal pathway like some congenital heart defect or some valve incompetency of right heart. your son had episodes of chest pain which is not a good sign, he probably needs a bilateral lower limb doppler to rule out any sort of blood clot which could have embolized from there to heart and lungs leading to pain and a dialed rv and murmur. good luck"

"a am on the pill but got put on an one day antibiotic pill , diflucan , for a yeast infection . a day after taking the pill , a had unprotected sex . realizing that the antibiotic may cause the birth control to not work properly , a took plan a roughly 70 hours later . however , a started my sugar pills the day before a took plan b. a usually get my period 3 to 4 days into my sugar pills . a have yet to get my period but a have heard hormones in plan a can cause it to be late . is my period delayed just until my next cycle of sugar pills since a had to start a new pack or could a be pregnant ?",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"hi my girlfriend is having some abdominal pain ... its on the right side ... she said it feels like its behind the ribs ... like a swelling feeling feels like its moving .... been to the or 3 times and they have said they have found nothing ... have tried gas beds . they worked for a min but she feels the pressure build back up , and that a without eating .",1,33660,"hi there, the backed up stool and tendency to urinary tract infection does point to the idea that she could be constipated, despite being regular. regarding the frequency of bowel movements, do note that different people tend to have different bowel needs, up to 3 times a day is accepted as normal. so she could actually be going daily and still be relatively constipated. what we are aiming for is the right consistency of stools, which is long and sausage-like, with or without cracks. if you need more visual guidance, look for the bristol stool chart online, and aim for type 3 or 4. it is good that she is taking enough fibers, but also pay attention to her habits and stress to her that she needs to go when she feels like it even if it is more than once a day. constipation often occurs at this age because this is when they are getting better at holding it in, and prefer other exciting activities to sitting in the toilet. the other rarer possibility would be that she has a mild form of hirschsprungs disease, which means that some nerves are missing from the end of the colon, making the evacuating of stool difficult. most people have this diagnosed as babies, but if its very mild it can be missed. it might be more likely if she had delayed bowel movement more than a day after birth, or had tendency to constipation even as a baby. you will have to discuss with your doctor on this possibility, because confirmation would be needed with a rectal biopsy. hope this helps, and all the best to you."

a just had a cat scan of my aorta path which was of however a mass showed up on one of my kidneys . i have not had any type of unusual pain it one time i did have a kidney stone . by question is could this showing be kidney stones ? this cal arnecke,1,34445,"hi, thanks for writing in. the collecting system of the kidney is made of renal calyxes and pelvis. this collects the urine formed in kidney and transports it through the ureter (tubes connecting kidneys and urinary bladder) to the urinary bladder. the pelvicalyceal system is the mouth of the kidney where it connects with the upper end of the ureter. i guess that you have got ultrasound scan done, and it shows mild fullness of the pelvicalyceal system in the left kidney, that is a term applied to increase in diameter of the collecting system in your left kidney. it is not a critical situation, and please do not worry if you do not have any urinary symptoms. since it is mentioned as mild fullness and no kidney stones have been found, therefore(i) it can be that your bladder was completely full at the of ultrasound scan(ii) your kidney pelvicalyceal system is appearing full by itself (extrarenal pelvis) and is an extension of normal appearance.(iii) rarely an infection of urinary system and kidneys (recent or old) can cause such a finding, but this is likely only if you have symptoms like pain in the region of kidney and problems like burning urination or discoloration of urine or any kidney infections in the past.(iv) stones in kidney or ureter can also cause fullness of pelvicalyceal system and since you do not have any stone therefore this does not apply to you. it is important to know if your scan was repeated after passing urine and still there was persistent mild fullness of the pelvicalyceal system on left side. this can also be confirmed by doing an mvp which is injecting a contrast and taking 5 to 6 x-rays to study the functioning of the kidneys in a better way. please consult the urologist."

( one of her friends died tragically last year but some of these behavior started before then but were less frequent )",2,70120,"hello lisa, thank you for asking at chat doctor. there are two types of allergy tests - skin prick test (which you have been undergone) and serum tests (immunogen or last). i suggest you not to be worried by test results. these tests are not 100%. they only complement a clinicians decision about diagnosis of your food allergy. if you are demographic, skin testing will give you what we call false positives (means even if test is positive you are not allergic to it). so in a demographic person, skin testing is not a reliable test. so forget the results of skin test if you are demographic!! diagnosis of food allergy requires a very detailed history about your symptoms & your diet, right from very beginning when you had your first allergy symptoms. this requires a detailed consultation. after suspecting the foods you may be allergic to, you may be advised serum allergy tests to support the diagnosis. the best diagnosis of food allergy is by food challenge which is done at specialized allergy centers. i would suggest you to keep a food diary in which you can keep note of food taken (including ingredients) and every symptom you developed, with time & date. this will help you and your doctor to suspect what is it that may be causing symptoms. common food allergies are milk, wheat, peanut, tree nuts, soy, eggs, fish & shellfish. but one can be allergic to any other food substances from routine diet. also, i should tell you that there are other gastrointestinal disorders which may mimic food allergy and there is food intolerance (in simple words it means one cannot tolerate some foods) also. a gastroenterologist consultation would be helpful to you if you don't have food allergy. so i would suggest you not to think that you are allergic to all foods! also, i would suggest you to take an antihistamine (levocetirizine or cetirizine or fexofenadine) and montelukast daily to control your symptoms. wish you best of the health. regards."

"i missed my period and have taken 3 at home pregnancy tests with all positive results . however , on each test the pregnancy line was really light . i went to the doctor today and did a urine test and they did their tests and said it showed positive right away and then it went away . this confused them so i had blood dawn but wont get results for a couple days . am i pregnant ? is there any way i am not pregnant after 3 positive ( but light ) tests and a missed period ?",1,35396,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. if you have not yet missed your period, even if you are pregnant, the line will appear very faint on the pregnancy test as your hormone levels are extremely low at this time in pregnancy. so there is no reason to assume that the test was wrong as the greatest likelihood is that you are actually pregnant. however, women can have a situation where they have a positive pregnancy test and then get their normal period on time. this is known as a chemical pregnancy and is caused by the situation where the egg is fertilized but never implants into the uterus and continues to grow. so i encourage patients in general to try to avoid performing pregnancy test before they actually miss their period, as even though you have a positive pregnancy test this early, it does not guarantee that the pregnancy is going to take. if your cycle is late, there is no reason to assume that there is any problem with the pregnancy. if you do retest after you miss your period and the line is still very weekly positive, it may be reasonable to see a physician and get a blood test for the level of your pregnancy hormone. pregnancy hormone levels are supposed to double every 48 hours so by the time you miss your period the levels should be significantly high enough to produce a clear double line on the pregnancy test especially if you perform it with your first morning urine as recommended. low hormone levels in early pregnancy can indicate that the pregnancy is not developing properly or that it can be an ectopic or tubal pregnancy, which needs to be diagnosed and accurately managed by a physician. in the meantime however, i encourage you to stop chat doctor. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes and good luck with the pregnancy,"

a have throbbing pain in my left shoulder and sometimes it travels all the way to my fingers where a experience a tingling sensation . it a not really bad but more annoying . a do physical work for a living but does to bother me anymore when using my shoulder to do tasks . just curious what it might be,1,50010,"there are a couple of things why you have tingling in your arm, 1.when you have pain in neck and along with that tingling in your arm with radiating pain to your arm it can be due to cervical disc problem. 2. when the pain and tingling arising from only shoulder level and there is no pain at neck level it can be due to shoulder soft tissue strain. 3.it may also be related to frozen shoulder. to check just stand with your back supported with wall and lift the hand up if you are able to touch the wall with your hand on upside then its negative. as well also try taking your hand on back and moving up. if this also is complete and no pain or numbness then again its negative. means it is not frozen shoulder. in all above 3test you can try on your own but the specialist if does will be more effective or doing under specialist guideline under his observation will be more effective. i suggest visiting either or tho or physio for this and get it evaluated and treated properly. till then, you can also use hot and cold pack at your home in a day frequently. usually tingling sensation or numbness indicates nerve trading at the level where it starts. take care."

a am a 48 or old female nurse and in june a visited my of with chest pain brought on by cardio exercise . be referred me to a cardiologist who found an ejection systolic murmur . a was referred for an echocardiogram and of angiogram . whilst waiting for these tests a developed chest pain at rest . the of angiogram is still pending but the echocardiogram showed aortic stenosis and mitral valve stenosis . the doctor doing the scan asked me if a had ever worked in a developing country which a had 7 years ago when my then boyfriend died suddenly of myocarditis ? cause . would you please tell me the relevance of being in namibia 7 years ago and my cardiac problems now ? and what is the likely prognosis and treatment ?,1,100009,"greetings! thank you for your question and welcome to chat doctor. i carefully read your query. mitral valve prolapse (mvp) is a benign condition that is estimated to be found in 16% of young ladies, and it may take up to forty or fifty years to produce symptoms, only after a chronic mitral regurgitation is installed. i would go on and say that further clinical investigation should be in order at this time, but i am quite confident that, if something was wrong with the mitral valve and the mitral regurgitation was there, it would have been told to you during the before 6 months echocardiogram. it would be only when a mitral regurgitation produced by a mitral valve prolapse that would enlarge the left atrium, when the high pressures in the enlarged left atrium would produce shortness of breath and, maybe, rapid heart rate corresponding with an atrial arrhythmia. and it would have shown in the echocardiogram, if the left atrium was enlarged. my opinion is that your problem is not being produced by the mitral valve prolapse, at this moment, at least. however, if this is a worrisome situation to you, then another echocardiogram should be done. of course, if mitral valve is found on a bad shape, after carefully measuring the function, size, and grade of regurgitation, adding to the possible symptoms, it is only then when mitral valve should be surgically replaced. as for the stress side, indeed substantial amounts of stress have their clear effect on the heart, by putting it to a significant dynamic state and by producing a chat doctor. there are a lot of natural means to reduce stress, starting from self-fighting of the stress to yoga or other methods. if this becomes problematic to you and affects your quality of life and work, i would recommend you a consult with a clinical psychologist regarding a course of sedatives to reduce it. i hope i was helpful. best regards."

my mon is having `` spells '' she is 65. in feb 2011 she was great and suddenly she got clay and vomited several times and was dizzy laid down and later was better but weak . yesterday she was watching to and suddenly got a burning/numbing pain between shoulder blades that went down both arms and her legs felt weak she laid down and her heart raced after 10 mind it quit but today her arms still each . i lost my dad to a massive heart attack he was 64. they are both stubborn and in only 26. do you think it could be heart attack ?,1,54073,"well hello her, reading about your mother i understand she had a lot of pre-existing problems which left her body very weak. as her age is not mentioned here, i'm assuming she must be an elderly lady. i'm really sorry for your loss and i know that there may be a thousand questions racing through your mind. let's look at them systematically. she was a diagnosed schizophrenic from an early age and on treatment which has its own long term side effects. a necessary evil cos schizophrenia should be treated and it's a long term thing, so side effects could not be avoided. she was a heavy smoker which affected her lungs and heart leading to development of heart failure and copd which are themselves life-threatening when present as independent entities in any patient. they were both present at the same time in your mothers case. one need not have a cancer. these two themselves are fatal problems leading to rapid decline in one's health. copd is the condition where the lungs are damaged mostly due to smoking as was in this case and are not able to meet the needs of the body resulting in frequent infections and also cardiac failure. smoking in itself is a major cause of heart failure as it causes degenerative changes in the heart and blood vessels. your mother was already suffering from two life-threatening conditions and this along with the c-diff diarrhea proved fatal. diarrhea in itself if not treated promptly proves fatal. so in this case we are seeing three independently life-threatening conditions coming together unfortunately, proving fatal in the end. so attributing your mothers death only to the c-diff diarrhea would not be appropriate. hope you got your answers. take care."

"recently live started noticing a random out of sync beating on he left side of my chest , coming and going at random times , i cant tell weather its my muscle or heart but live tried to check my pulse during the beating and it seems normal but too weak to really tell",2,25338,"hello and thank you for using chat doctor. i carefully read your question and understand your concern. but you should not worry, its nothing serious. as you describe, my opinion is that it might be a rhythm issue. someone can feel strong and fast heart beats for different reasons. it may be a simple sinus tachycardia. this means that the heart is beating faster than 100 beats for minute. its normal range in a resting condition is between 60-100 beats for minute. when it goes up you may feel a strong heart beat in your chest and a sensation like your body is beating too. another reason for this sensation might be what we call an ekstrasystol.these is electrical heart impulses that generates in some parts of heart different from normal sinus rhythm. this generates an escaped beat that the person feels like jumping ore bumping. it gives the sensation like a beat is skipping, may experience palpitations or an anxiety sensation that your daughter explains like trembling. this extrasistoles may happen from different reasons from simple emotional stress to other pathologies like anemia, hyperthyroidism etc. so, my opinion as cardiologist is that you have nothing to worry. it is just a simple episode, and it is quite normal in younger ages. only if these symptoms persist and begins to interfere the daily live, if i was your treating doctor i will recommend some examinations like a blood analysis to exclude anemia, the thyroid hormones, an electrocardiogram, echocardiography and of course a holder monitoring. this will help us to document and see what happens with heart rhythm. at meantime, i will recommend your daughter to avoid coffee, caffeine products because they rise heart frequency and extrasistolic beats. i encourage her to have physical training because sometimes it helps in reducing extrasistoles, tachycardia, even making them disappear. wish i was helpful. take good care. best regards"

i have a painful lump in my jaw after a root canal . the root canal followed a crown placement and subsequent infection so the root canal was done on an emergency basis . a am on anti biotic but still not getting pain relief . is the infection spreading into my jawbone ?,1,35390,hi. can understand your concern. as per your complaint you have got two crowns placed and pain after this can be due to either of the following reasons. one reason can be in case if the crowns were placed without root canal treatment of tooth (it is a treatment in which the nerves and blood vessels present in the tooth are cut off either to relieve pain due to infection or as an intentional procedure to avoid complications like pain and sensitivity after crown placement) the preparation of the tooth for seating the crown if done in excess can lead to opening of nerves and when the crown is placed over opened nerves it can cause inflammation of nerve and hence severe pain. in case if the crowns are placed after root canal treatment for an infected tooth pain can be due to persistent infection leading to pus formation and pressure which is not subsided or there is some vital nerve tissue left out in any missed root canal can cause severe pain on crown placement. i would suggest you to consult an endodontist and get evaluated clinically as well as by getting x-ray done to rule out the cause of pain. in case if root canal is not done and pain is due to irritated nerves the crown needs to be removed followed by root canal treatment and medicines and once pain is completely subsided crown can be placed again. in case of root canal treated tooth also re treatment will have to be done. you can take painkiller like eugenic plus or retool dt (one tablet dissolved in half a glass of water) to provide relief. hope your query is solved. if you find the answer helpful please write a positive review and click on find this answer helpful as a token of appreciation. thanks and regards. chat doctor.

i have a painful lump in my jaw after a root canal . the root canal followed a crown placement and subsequent infection so the root canal was done on an emergency basis . a am on anti biotic but still not getting pain relief . is the infection spreading into my jawbone ?,3,10813,"hi. welcome to chat doctor . i have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. as per your complaint if you have a temporary crown over your tooth since 2 weeks, and you still have pain it is not a normal finding and needs consultation with a dentist to rule out the cause of pain. as of now you can take advil [ibuprofen] for relieving pain rather that tylenol as advil is more effective in reducing pain and inflammation. i would like to give you additional information that if after 2 weeks also you have pain in the tooth with a temporary crown, you need to consult a dentist and get evaluated and also get an iop ar [x-ray] done to rule out the exact cause of pain. at times high points over the crown can be a cause of pain and trimming of the same can relieve the pain. other causes can be:if the tooth is root canal treated before crown placement there re-infection in the tooth can be a cause of pain and in that case removal of crown followed by repetition of root canal treatment followed by antibiotics and painkillers and replacement of crown will relieve. if root canal treatment was not done there is a possibility that while preparing the tooth to retain the crown there have been some nerve exposure and inflammation of nerve is causing pain. in this case root canal treatment has to be done after removing crown and then crown has to be replaced. hope this information helps. thanks and regards. chat doctor."

"hi there , i seemed to have developed a lump of some sort in the pubic hair region just above the penis and over to the left . its currently quite small , but is very slightly visible when looking down . it feels like some sort of cyst when pressed with my fingers and is not sensitive to touch . in not sure how long its been there , but live noticed it this last week . any ideas ?",1,5854,"hello and welcome to chat doctor. i am chat doctor. i can understand your concerns and i will be answering you . what is your age.?? are you diabetic or do you have its family history.?? any history of chronic disease.?? there are lumps anywhere else or not.?? lump is painful or not .?? do you have fever . ?? if i were treating you in my clinic i would have palpated that lump to look for its consistency. i would have looked for its mobility under the skin.i would have done skin pinch test to rule out sebaceous cyst or lipoma.according to the information you presented it seems that you have developed a sebaceous cyst. these cysts are most common in hairy areas. these cysts develop due to blockage of the duct of sebaceous glands. thus the gland is unable to empty its secretion(sebum) and it enlarges with the passage of time. sebum helps in the lubrication of hair. the diagnostic point of sebaceous cyst is a puncture(hair follicle on the surface of the cyst).the definitive treatment of sebaceous cyst is its surgical excision which is a minor procedure done using local anesthetic such as lidocaine or bupivacaine. you will be able to home right away.2nd on my list would have been a lipoma. lipoma is freely mobile under the skin and one can pinch skin overlying it. if lipoma is causing problem i.e. cosmetic problem or in your case interfering with you sleep, then it needs surgical excision. it is also a minor procedure.3rd on my list would have been an abscess. abscess fluctuates when one puts two fingers on it and presses one finger. mature abscess will need surgical adequate dependent"

( 30 yrs old ) .",3,74421,"hello. thank you for writing to us at chat doctor i think you have developed a large bruise or an ecchymosis at the site of trauma resulting from fall. this is nothing but due to soft tissue bleeding and would resolve within a few days. there is no role of topical antibiotic like bacitracin because the overlying skin would be intact in a bruise. you might notice a color change over it as the suffused hemoglobin degrades and therefore changes color to bluish red, green, yellow and finally resolves. if i was the treating doctor i would suggest an oral vitamin c supplement once daily for a week or 10 days. regards"
"recently , a had a rocephin shot and was on bactria for a week for a uti . after a finished the bactria a had a rash on my waist and back . or said probably a reaction to bactria and put on a prednisone dosepak for a week . all that went away , but the inside of my bottom lip feels dry and very leathery . would this , too , be some kind of reaction ? wednesday will be 2 weeks since a finished the medicine .",1,2218,"hi.based from your description, the lump could be secondary to the trauma she recently had. it could only be an inflammatory reaction, wherein swelling ensues and will subside eventually in a few days time. fibrous tissue formation may also be occurring especially on the area that was injured, hence the appearance of the bump. a consult with her doctor is best for clinical evaluation. observation and analgesics may be given for now. if the signs and symptoms persist for more than a week, diagnostics (such as x-ray) and management (medical and/or surgical) will be directed accordingly. hope this helps. good day!!~ chat doctor."

"a think my granddaughter had a seizure and when we took her to the or we were released and told to observe her because she did to have any sign currently . the is 1-1/2 and was in daycare . it scared the heck out of her teacher and they described my granddaughter has walking sorta in a drunken state , her left arm drawn up to her chest and shaking , she said she was non responsive but had a look of horror and then she fell and hit her head on the table . be rushed her to the or and after waiting 3-1/2 hours , went into the room and they briefly examined her ( no blood work , x-rays or nothing ) just listened to her lungs , looked in her ears and checked to see if she was running a fever . they said she appeared to be fine and to take her home but observe her ever 2 hours .",1,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

( sorry for wrong english )",3,105983,"dear patient, thank you very much for your question. first i want to tell you that masturbation is an innocent, absolutely normal human sexual response. according latest research men who have often practiced masturbation are less prone to prostate cancer in later ages. therefore, do not worry about masturbation. it does not have side effects. it is absolutely normal and harmless. however, the fear or guilt you have towards masturbation has resulted to create your anxiety. i believe those non-specific above-mentioned symptoms are also related to anxiety. when you have anxiety and do not know a way to solve your problems it coverts into depression. your suicidal thoughts are part of your depression. dear reader, you have to understand for what you are worrying is meaningless. almost all men have practiced masturbation in their lives. your problem is you just overlook at your problem. also, all your above-mentioned symptoms are due to your anxiety, therefore,treating your symptoms mean in other words treating your build up anxiety. also, men when they are sexually aroused fluids from prostate and cowper glands start leaking through the urethra. this is what you have seen as semen and during sexual excitement leaking of these fluids is again normal. you do not have to suicide. you are a healthy young man. my advice is you have to see a psychiatrist immediately. he is the right person to help you. believe me you life will be good and happy. stop worrying and consult a psychiatrist soon. good luck!"
my periods are irregular and i am spotting or bleeding heavy my periods are irregular and i am spotting or bleeding heavy for about 2 and half weeks at a time my husband and i are trying to get present and we have had no luck we have a 8 year old all ready and no birth control in over 4 years what could this be,1,28287,"hi, when you start taking birth control pills, you might not see regular periods for a few months. you might see irregular spotting, lighter periods than you are used to or a heavier flow, a longer or shorter period, or no periods at all for the first month or so. your body needs to adjust and regularize the hormone levels. you can wait and watch the bleeding pattern in the next few cycles which will regularize with time. heavy bleeding should be treated immediately to avoid excess blood loss and anemia. hope i have answered your question. let me know if i can assist you further."

my periods are irregular and i am spotting or bleeding heavy my periods are irregular and i am spotting or bleeding heavy for about 2 and half weeks at a time my husband and i are trying to get present and we have had no luck we have a 8 year old all ready and no birth control in over 4 years what could this be,3,27194,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. tri-sprintec is a birth control pill that has a traffic regimen; which means that each color pill in the package has a slightly different dose of hormones. occasionally, women who take traffic pills may have some spotting in the first few days after each pill strength changes over the course of the month. this may cause some slight bleeding or spotting when were not supposed to have your period. whenever you had vaginal bleeding, regardless of the cause, usually there is some cramping that accompanies it. furthermore, it is not unusual to have irregular bleeding or spotting in the first 3 months of pill use. both sprinter and tri-sprintec are considered low-dose birth control pills, however there are many brands on the market that have a lower dose of estrogen than the pill you are currently taking. so you may have less irregular bleeding and spotting on a different kind of monophasic (same dose all month) birth control pill. regarding pregnancy, the chance of your conceiving while taking birth control pills and using a condom is basically nonexistent. so i believe the symptoms you were experiencing are side effects due to the new birth control pill. if your desire is for lighter, regular periods, a different brand of monophasic pill may work better for you with fewer side effects. i hope i was able to adequately answer questions today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"
"i think i may be having a miscarriage . i have taken an at home test , but not seen a doctor yet to confirm the pregnancy . at most in 9 weeks along . i am scheduled for an abortion on friday . can i wait until friday to be check out , or should i be concerned now ?",1,52028,"by 6 weeks of pregnancy, we should definitely be able to see a baby and a heartbeat on ultrasound. what you are describing is concerning for a spontaneous abortion (miscarriage). the fact that they couldn't see a baby is also concerning. we have a rule in the ob world- a positive pregnancy test without visualization of a baby is an ectopic pregnancy until proven otherwise. an ectopic pregnancy is a pregnancy outside the uterus, usually in the fallopian tube-this can be life-threatening and needs to be treated either medically or surgically. i am not fazed by the fact that your blood hormone chat doctor was positive- it can take a couple of weeks for the hormone to disappear from your system after a miscarriage or during an ectopic. your hormone level needs to be monitored every 48 hours until your doctor can clarify if this is a miscarriage, an ectopic pregnancy, or a normal pregnancy. with the amount of bleeding you are having, it sounds like you are miscarrying. however, i cannot rule out an ectopic pregnancy at this point. please follow up with your doctor as soon as possible, especially if you are still bleeding heavily or having a lot of pain. heavy bleeding can make you anemic, which may mean you could need a blood transfusion. severe abdominal pain is concerning for an ectopic. either way, please follow up with your doctor. best of luck!"

morning by has been high . rapid or and weak/shakey . read ache and ears hurt . by or sent me to have it and egg . as told it showed brain and sinus clear and egg normal . as told to go home and take it easy as well as monitor by . up down today but still weak and tired . any thought . also take synthroid and anti depressant . a week ago had sinus infection and fluid on ears .,1,22667,"dear patient, i can understand your concern and feel sorry for the pain you are suffering from. you are informing me that when you got the upper molar extracted, the dentist told you that the bone between the sinus and tooth is destroyed and sinus cavity is open. roots of upper molar often are found inside the maxillary sinus, which causes opening of the sinus cavity while extraction of the tooth, creating an oro-antral fistula, that is a direct connection between oral cavity and sinus cavity. in this case, the food or water you take has chances of passing infection in the sinus through mouth and the infection does not resolve. it is mandatory to close this connection between mouth and the sinus. it could be done by the dentist by taking stitches in the area when he found that sinus has opened, but it can also be done now. however, as about 2 weeks has passed since extraction, the opening would not be as much clear as it would have been during extraction. a blood clot may have filled the area. so what you need to do now is, go to an oral surgeon or an ent specialist. i know you have insurance problem, but there seems no other solution to your problem. you might have to go for x-rays and probably ct scan of the area to diagnose if oro-antral fistula actually exists and if it does, you might have to go for a little surgery to close the communication between mouth and sinus followed by antibiotics to resolve the infection. i hope this information helps. thank you for choosing chat doctor. i wish you get well soon. best,"

if ovulation takes place properly is this means that my tubes work properly or not ?,1,17442,"dear madam, all the tests done on both of you are normal. by this statement, i presume that you are releasing the egg normally, your both the tubes are patent, the uterine lining is normal and there is no tumor or any abnormality in the uterus. also, that there is no infection in the vagina. furthermore i understand that the semen examination of your husband has revealed normal sperm count with normal motility. in such case, i would suggest you to go for ovulation monitoring. you will have to submit yourself for ultrasonography from day 9 onwards till the ovulation (egg release) takes place. usually the ovulation occurs when the follicle of the egg attains the size of 18 mm. utilize this day, a day before and after this. plan your sexual intercourse on these days. if there is no other abnormality, this should make you happy. if the ovulation takes place after the follicle attains more than 21 mm size, the chances of fertilization are very poor. may i suggest you one more test, if you have not done it already. please get the post-coital semen examination done. in this test, semen is collected from your vagina after the intercourse for microscopic examination. sometimes, the vagina contains antibodies or environment which is hostile to the sperms. in such cases, the sperms which were normal in semen examination, show dead or sluggish in this test. thus, this test reveals whether your intraluminal environment is hostile to your husbands semen or you have got antibodies against his sperms which is preventing factor for the fertilization. if it is so, you may ask me direct question by going to my profile and upload the reports for my review so that i can advise you some measures. i hope this much advice should give you some direction."

"i , so a month ago now a was in a wake boarding accident and a went face first into the water at a high speed . a was diagnosed with concussion , a had a very painful headache predominantly located on my front left side of my head as well as dizziness , nausea , fatigue and sensitivity to noise and light . for the first two weeks a could to bare to be out of a dark room especially without a bucket as a could literally feel the vomit in my throat rising up , although a never did vomit . a be had plenty of doctor trips to my of who does to seem completely sure what a going on , and since then a be been told to get out of the dark room and sit up right instead of laying down which a have been doing . nothing has seemed to be getting much better , so the last time a went to see the doctor he sent me up to the hospital for an emergency of which never went ahead because the doctor at the hospital said a of could be harmful to my lady parts and could increase my risk of a brain tumour . to a was sent home with pain killers and nausea tablets which do nothing at all . a a slightly concerned about my head and if there is any damage . pm a right to be concerned or am a worrying for nothing ?",1,64277,"hi, thank you for the brief history of the patient. you have mentioned many things here, but some crucial information might be missing to give a comment on the same. since there was a pain in the lower back all of a sudden with abdominal pain he was admitted to the hospital.of course i could see from the mentioned reports that doctor tried hard to help reduce pain as the treatment will be always symptomatically taken. also since the pain level was not reducing they performed an exploratory laparotomy as the diagnostic procedure. you have even mentioned the appendectomy in your explanation for which i wish to know that which qua chat doctor. if you could provide some more detail it will of an input to comment. also as you mentioned the patient as a retired or still practicing at the age of 71 as a practicing doctor. well to take this into consideration what type of animals he used to see mostly and what was his area of interest in veterinary practice. don't take me wrong, but i am just trying to figure out if any viral infection from the animal bad led to a sudden pain in the back and abdomen. also you have mentioned that he was cycling 15kms, bp, hr etc. was all normal, it is never a sure that how a human body reacts and behaves from time to time. so if the parameters are normal that doesn't always mean that the person may not have other symptoms. don't take me wrong on this statement of mine. i spend more time with geriatric patients aged between 60-100, so i have little understanding of the physical status and fluctuations of parameters which can misguide. since now the patient is paralyzed as per you mentioned in the history. is he totally paralyzed or half? what is the disability score of the patient?now looking to the treatment plan with the scenario to keep in mind i will request you to first make an arrangement of a physiotherapist who can help him by regular exercises of course it will be passive and may help him to recover. also you should see that there is no formation of pressure sores of any infection to the patient. because that will directly affect the metabolism and immune system of the body. if you can provide more inputs or give a detailed history of the patient from the time of arising of symptoms and till date i will be able to comment something. my mail and number will be available in the forum for which you can contact me. i am actually trying to understand the scene what happened when and how, what was the cause, etc. etc. so with the grace of god i pray that the patient recovers soon."

(as you said he has difficulty in walking now). you can also say to his parents that --- they can continue with all religious customs along with medicines, may be then they will agree... with medicine, he will start showing improvement in few days only... it is psychosis and patients will not agree to go to any doctor willingly, so you might need to take him forcefully. this is well accepted as it is for his benefit only. even if he doesn't agree for oral medicine there are injectables which are given to such patients... take the right step, take him to a doctor. hope the reply is useful feel free to ask more questions"

"pm 24 healthy single male 185 pounds my question is quite a few months back i lost my virginity at a late age i know , my question is how long should i last normally when having sex with a female companionsince i have not had lot of experience and i lost it to a friend and we done it a few times since , but she did say i need to last longer so what is the average time a guy should last before he ejaculate for orgasms and how to i go about lasting longer in the future ?",1,95651,"hello, with regard to your question, the answer is that there is nothing wrong with you. if you last 1-2 minutes during penetrating sex then this is ok. there is no receipt on how long a male penetrating act has to last and this is hugely variable from a few seconds to many minutes. it is true that today the pressure to ""perform as long as possible"" during penetrating sex is an obsession for men, but this does not mean that this should be the norm. the norm is what nature has designated for each of us. we are often misled by sexual materials we are bombarded with on tv and internet but most time those videos are distorting the reality and many performers take pills or various substances in order to make penetrating sex last longer. therefore, no man has to feel guilty if he can not last ""as long as it should"" during penetrating sex. i think that the more you engage with your partner, the longer your penetrating sex will last meaning that very likely you will last longer than 1-2 minutes. also, you have to manage stress more efficiently, if it is possible. if you are not circumcised than this could be another factor shortening your penetrating sex period because it is believed that uncircumcised men have a more sensitive penis head. i think that you do not need to do anything, nor seeing a doctor or turning to certain substances in order to increase your penetrating sex time. if you have solid erections, if you have no problems in having erections, if you manage to perform penetrating sex with your partner, then everything is fine and normal. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further. take care chat doctor."

by mon had knee surgery a few months ago and she has recently had these bruises that will itch and then flare up with red lumps like an allergic reaction they last a couple of days and when they disappear her skin stays a darker shade of her normal skin tone . her surgeon said it might be a reaction to the pain beds and to just apply hydrocortisone cream . it does to seem to be helping any suggestions ? ?,1,65296,"hi & welcome to chat doctor. i appreciate your concern for the chamber disease & hives. as such they are not related. schambergs disease is a chronic discoloration of the skin which usually affects the legs and often spreads slowly. it is caused by leaky blood vessels near the surface of the skin, capillaries, which allow red blood cells to slip through into the skin. the red blood cells in the skin then fall apart and release their iron which causes a rust color, this accounts for the orange tint of the rash. hives (urticaria) are raised, often itchy, red bumps on the surface of the skin. they are usually due to an allergic reaction to food or medicine. when you have an allergic reaction to a substance, your body releases histamine and other chemicals into the blood. this causes itching, swelling, and other symptoms. there is no cure for chambers disease; the itching can be controlled by a cortisone cream on the affected area. for hives treatment may not be needed if they are mild. they may disappear on their own. avoid the triggers for the allergic reaction. to reduce itching and swelling:do not take hot baths or showers. do not wear tight-fitting clothing, which can irritate the area. an antihistamine like defense chat doctor."

"a had a tuba ligation about 5-6 years ago . in october of last year i was awaken by sharp pain and severe burning in my ovaries . it felt like they were literally on fire . now for the past 6 months i have had symptoms of a pregnant woman , such as contractions , something hurting me near my ribs , sharp pain on the left side , bloating . it looks like i am pregnant . and today i couldn't bend over to touch my toes without having sharp pain in my left side and ribs . that could this be ? ave seen doctors but get no answer .",1,28983,"hello. thank you for your question and welcome to chat doctor. i carefully read your query. first, i believe that you know what does a chest pain originated from coronary arteries feel like. this is called angina, and is more like a severe heaviness or tightness in the mid-chest and which spreads to the left arm. sharp pain with the highest probability does not reflect a pain originated from a blockage in the coronary arteries. on the stent side, since it has been seven years you underwent stent implantation, i assume that the stents are patent and working well, since the highest probability for them to narrow is within 6 to 12 months after implantation, depending on from the stent placed. however, once you had coronary artery disease, although treated at that time, you have an independent risk factor to develop coronary artery disease again. i would recommend you to undergo a cardiac stress test, based on the above-mentioned fact, and the strain you felt in your heart area. as for the sharp pain in your left arm, my opinion is that it is not connected to coronary arteries. i hope i was of help. kind regards."

(after removal of plant from home, it takes a food weeks to actually clear pollen from home, that's why it takes longer)5. till you have symptoms, i would suggest you to take regular montelukast and levocetirizine. hope above suggestions will be helpful to you. should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at chat doctor. wish you the best of the health. thank you & regards."

"i dr. samuel am 35 year old male . a slim body shape.i had stomach problem from some days . a test my l. f. t. and h. pylori . h. pylori is reactive . and in lft alt level is 42 , bilirubin is 1.72 . in previous day a took some multivitamins . is there anything worry about me .",2,97433,"hi, after reviewing your question i assume you mean a positive breath test for h. pylori? i am sorry to hear the amount of discomfort that you've been through. this is how i would proceed to look at your case:1. your symptoms are very peculiar for peptic ulcer disease or gastritis. both are different ways of getting damage done to your stomach. an ulcer is like a crater which may or may not be prone to bleeding. gastritis is a bit like having multiple pinpoint sore spots, causing pain and discomfort. a positive breath test may mean that you have h. pylori infection. as uncomfortable as this is, it is usually very treatable. were you on many painkillers because of the spinal fusion? if yes, then they would certainly have contributed. 2. i don't think a mask has anything to do with this. a sterile nasogastric tube taken out of the bag is very unlikely to bring infection to the insides of the stomach. nasogastric tubes, however, do cause a bit of irritation in the stomach lining. while they could have a very small contribution, i doubt they have had a significant effect. 3. the problem at hand seems to be the h. pylori infection which is a bacterial infection of the stomach lining which causes wear and tear in the stomach. this bug is acquired by the orofacial route. what this means is that someone with h. pylori sheds the bacteria through their stools. sometimes, because of poor hand hygiene, they may pass it on to others, especially through food. the new victim ingests these bugs and in this way h. pylori finds a new home to infest. i don't think your husband having a breath test will add to anything if he does not have symptoms. 4. an unintentional weight loss may signify a gastric ulcer (in opposition to peptic ulcer)5. you may benefit from a look down into the stomach through gastrostomy. it will give a great deal of information. your weight loss is also an indication of getting you a ct scan of the abdomen to ensure that there is nothing dangerous in play. 6. treatment would include amoxicillin, azithromycin and an acid tablet such as omeprazole for a 10 to 14-day course. since these recommendations include a gastrostomy, you will eventually have to visit a physician or a gastroenterologist to have it done. gastroenterologists are also excellent at managing h. pylori infections, along with ulcers and gastritis."

now likely is it that the lungs would be permanently damaged following 2 separate episodes of pulmonary emboli ? the first episode was caused by an ankle fracture and went undiagnosed for 5 weeks . the second episode was 7 years later and no obvious cause has been found . worried about the damage that the clots have caused to the lungs .,1,6933,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the effectiveness of the morning after pill has not been studied specifically regarding its success rates in preventing pregnancy with multiple episodes of intercourse. however, sperm remain in the female genital tract for up to 72 hours, which is why the pill is most effective within that window of time. the overall success rate for preventing pregnancy with the i-pill for one episode of intercourse is 90 percent, meaning 10 percent of the time the woman can conceive anyway. so i would recommend that in this situation that a second dose of the i-pill be taken, even if the second episode of intercourse was within 72 hours, because live sperm could remain after the first pill has worn off. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful. best wishes,"

i my sister has the implant taken out on 5th november and straight away tried to get pregnant . well she is now pregnant but she had a period in december and a little in january but the midwife says she can feel her uterus and is about 12-13 weeks but from her period and her clear blue test she is only 6 weeks . would she be having twins or just have a thick uterus ?,1,40763,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the clearblue test is not very accurate in predicting gestational age. the amount of pregnancy hormone in a women urine can vary depending on the time of day she did the test and how much water she had to chat doctor. furthermore, many women have some bleeding in the first trimester of pregnancy, so the bleeding she had in december and january may not have been her real period at all. the most accurate way to test the age of a pregnancy, is an ultrasound exam to measure the fetus. this is normally done during the course of her routine prenatal care. an ultrasound is also necessary to determine if there is more than one fetus present. in your sisters case, if she conceived in november, the measurements of her uterus at this point would be accurate. so i would recommend that she have an ultrasound exam (which i am sure will be done soon as part of her routine prenatal care) to confirm her due date and the viability of the pregnancy. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes to your sister for her pregnancy,"

hmm i taken different brands birth control pills this time .... i had the left over 3 mercian pills and then i had 5 yak pills in the past 8days a my partner ejaculated inside my body on the 8th day . may i know is the protection active or i might face the risk to become pregnant too ?,1,80020,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, the treatment of endometriosis with continuous birth control does help a lot of women with the pain associated with endometriosis. however, the side effects of bloating and breast tenderness can be due to the birth control, and the fact that you are taking them continuously compounds the symptoms over time. secondly, many women will have their period delayed after stopping birth control pills, especially if the pill has suppressed your period. so the fact that your cycle has not yet returned after stopping the yam is not unusual. even though you had bothersome side effects from the yam, there are many brands of birth control pills with different active ingredients that you can try to take for continuous use. the pill brands vary in name by the country in which you live, but a pill with the active ingredient levonorgestrel is the most popular type of extended cycle pill in the u.s. and i suggest you discuss changing to a brand with this active ingredient with your local physician. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

today a had some light pink vaginal discharge . a be never had that before . before my periods a just get light bleeding in clear discharge . this was kinda thick and pink . by periods are irregular and a use a diaphragm or condoms when having sex . a be only ever been with my husband . does that sound like a sign a of pregnancy ?,2,40826,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, if you have been using contraception (even a barrier method) every time you have sex, your chance of pregnancy is extremely low no matter what your symptoms are. secondly, having occasional abnormal vaginal discharge is more likely a symptom of a vaginal infection than pregnancy. slight bleeding can be caused if the vaginal canal is very irritated, and if your discharge is thick, there is a possibility you may have a vaginal yeast infection that is causing inflammation in the vagina. pregnancy symptoms vary widely between women, but the most common sign of pregnancy is missing your period. nausea, fatigue, bloating, breast tenderness and mood changes are some other symptoms that are commonly associated with pregnancy, however all these can also be caused by irregular hormone production. so if your period is not late, i strongly believe that your symptoms are likely due to an infection in your vagina rather than pregnancy symptoms. i recommend evaluation by a gynecologist or your women's health provider to examine your vagina and determine the cause of the discharge. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was helpful. best wishes,"

"my mother in-law has just been told she has encephalomlacia . what can we expect for her treatment if there is one , and how long does she have before it gets worse ? her entire front of her brain is effected and on the fri , most of what was shown was already white in color . a never heard of this before , any help a can give would be greatly appreciated .",1,42968,"basically your mother is suffering from breast cancer which has been operated upon, and she is a known patient of heart disease for which she has been scented. the biopsy shows that at least one node has tumor. ideally in such a situation i would recommend chemotherapy to her. but that she can't take safely due to her heart condition. what i would like to know before i can comment upon her survival is the size of the tumor that was removed and whether it has spread to other parts of the body (on chest x-ray, ultrasound abdomen, bone scan). if it's an early tumor (less than 5 cm in size, not spread), then the chances of her being cured just with surgery are nearly 80%. we can further improve these chances by knowing her receptor status. this test can be done on the tumor that has already been removed and is called er (estrogen receptor) and pr (progesterone receptor). if any of these are positive then she can be placed on a tablet for 5 years. this tablet will not affect her heart and decrease the chances of disease recurrence by almost 33%."

i a a 35 years old and 7 weeks pregnant . a recently was diagnosed with a uni and was prescribed amoxicillin . in this third day taking the antibiotics a a experiencing very bad backaches . a don to know is this is normal for pregnancy or something more serious due to the antibiotics ? a a not spotting or cramping . but the backache is starting to get really uncomfortable .,1,95293,"thank you for the question. while the morning after pill is very effective, it is not 100% effective. if you got pregnant, then a pregnancy test will turn positive about two weeks after conception. also, the symptoms you are describing are possibly related to pregnancy as you can have cramping and spotting. yes, this might be implantation bleeding. if you check a pregnancy test, and it is positive then get checked out immediately to make sure that this is a normal pregnancy or possibly a pregnancy in one of your tubes (called an ectopic pregnancy). that being said, it is much more likely that you are not pregnant and bleeding or spotting in the week after taking the morning after pill is also very common. finally, this pill will also likely delay the next period. i hope that this helps and good luck!"

"hi , a am 10 weeks pregnant and twice i have noticed 2drops of brown stains .. we went to the doc and she said things were perfectly normal the baby had indeed grown and the heartbeat too was fine now my question is we plan on a holiday say end of 12 weeks as it is my husbands annual leave ... kindly let me know if it cud be safer to travel ....",1,85262,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. there are two possibilities of what may be going on if you do not yet see a heartbeat with your pregnancy. the first, even though you are sure of your lmp, conception can take place at a different time in your cycle than you expected. the egg can live inside you up to 72 hours after ovulation, and sperm can remain alive inside you for up to 5 days. so you actually may have conceived a week later than you thought, which means that you are only 6 weeks pregnant. it can be normal to not see a heartbeat at 6 weeks. the other possibility is that the fetus died already at 6 weeks, which is a miscarriage that has not come out yet. the way we can figure out what is going on is to check another ultrasound in a week or so. if there is no heartbeat by 7 weeks, then the diagnosis of a miscarriage is correct. so i know it is hard to be patient, but there is nothing that can be done to prevent miscarriage. one of every 10 pregnancies are miscarriages, meaning 90 percent of the time after a miscarriage women go on to have a healthy baby. i hope i was able to answer your question and that this information was helpful to you. best wishes, and good luck with the pregnancy,"

"a have had so many test done to make sure that my stomach and intestines are alright . but even after all of those test ...... whenever a have an abdominal examination , it hurts really bad whenever doctors apply even the slightest pressure too my stomach . why is this ?",1,21962,"dear simone, there is one rule for doctors here in croatia: when you think too much, stop, and think again, but this time think for the simplest diagnose. if you have pain in abdomen and an umbilical hernia seen on us then the first thing to think about is ""abdominal pain caused by hernia"":). there are many conditions in medicine where pain doesn't need to beau localized near the ""pathology"". sometimes pain can be felt on the opposite side of the affected organ. it is known that one of common symptom of myocardial infarction is pain in the left shoulder. also, infection of the abdominal organs can give many types and localizations of pain. the reason for it is simple: when i see pain, i see nerves, not organs (this is my own phrase:)). nerves conduct pain, and nerves are all around, going from periphery to the brain, so pain can be localized on its pathway, so just let's go back to your problem. doctor should tell you the size of hernia and its content which can be only preperitoneal tissue, momentum or even intestines. this dark triangle...mmm.it can be nothing and everything. i usually don't trust our ultrasonographer because they are strange people... sometimes they don't see what they need to see, or they see what they don't need to see. all i see is that us is operator-dependent diagnostic test... but we shouldn't underestimate this finding. it can be uterine moma, endometriosis, cyst or tumor. and yes, it can cause pain you're describing. so what you need to do: 1. ct scan of pelvic and abdominal region. why? as i said, these us findings are always doubtful, ct is a high sensitive test which will find the exact problem for sure. it will tell you the size and severity of hernia and the morphology of this uterine lesion. it can also find some other problems in its early phase."

"air , i have a being tumour entangled in brachial plexus region , doctors suggested operation is not required as its risky and i get pain only when i a tired or any stress or if its too hot .... but i get severe pain and its from last 10 years ... plus suggest what to do",1,93014,"hi, thanks for asking from chat doctor. i can understand your concern. you had nerve grafting for brachial plexus years ago. as you mentioned there was no improvement. i will first tell you about nerve recovery and then mention other options. the best recovery and regeneration of damaged nerve occurs in first 6 months. after it slows down, and it almost stops after 12 months. the last cut-off is 18 months. the ideal time for nerve graft surgery is 3 to 6 months post-brachial plexus injury (blunt injury) and immediate exploration if cut injury. now as many years have passed, nerve graft is not an option here. it is because muscles atrophy after years. even if nerve regenerates, muscle will not respond. so nerve reconstructing surgeons have developed other alternatives- free muscle and tendon transfer - here muscle is rotated from its original site and re-implanted in upper limb to provide shoulder abduction. e.g. gracilis muscle.- vascular pedicle muscle graft - here muscle is completely transferred to upper limb. its vascular supply is anastomoses to limb artery and nerve to healthy nerve. - joint fusion - shoulder is fused in slight abduction and elbow in 90 degree flexions. wrist and fingers are fused in mid-pronation, slight flexion. the problem is that the results are not that much good. fine movements can not occur. only gross movements can occur. you can discuss above options with surgeon. hope it will help. if any doubts, do let me know. thanks. take care. chat doctor."

"i . ave been dating this guy for five months now . eve made the decision to have sex . be use condoms , and his mon has offered to get me birth control . a was just wondering if there is anything else we can do or if there a certain time of the month before , after , or in between my periods that would be the best to prevent pregnancy and still be able to have sex ?",1,15745,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. first, if you are late for your shot and have had unprotected sex, even if you are bleeding, you should do a urine pregnancy test. if your pregnancy test is negative, many women do not have regular periods come back after discontinuing the depo-provera injection for even up to 6 months. this, however, does not mean that you cannot become pregnant. if you are not actively trying to get pregnant, a good way to help regulate your cycles until your own body resumes a regular cycle is by taking birth control pills. birth control pills make you get a light, regular, predictable cycle every month and will help control breakthrough bleeding (the brown staining you have all the time). many women have irregular bleeding in the first 6 months to a year of using the shot, and unfortunately the same thing can happen after you discontinue it. so, in summary, all the irregular bleeding you are having is likely due to your discontinuing the demo shot. if you need contraception, the monthly cycle birth control pill would be a good option that can also help you have regular cycles. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"a am a 23 year old female . today a woke up and when a breathe in deeply a feel tightening on my chest , close to my collar bone . by throat is also bothering me along with my left ear . pm not sure if the chest pain is because a am developing a cold or it has to deal with my heart .",1,64589,"greetings. welcome to chat doctor, and thank you for your question. i understand your concern. clearly, you were preoccupied by this new event or sensation you were experiencing. in various stressful situations, both physical or psychological, heart rate and blood pressure are parameters that increase. your age is not very consistent with a coronary artery origin of this pain (i.e. a blockage within the coronary arteries - arteries that encompass the heart as a crown, hence the name, and supply the heart muscle with oxygen and important nutrients). however, angina is more like a squeezing or heaviness felt in the mid-chest which radiates to the throat and jay, and left shoulder and left arm, starts on exertion, is not related to the food intake, and is relieved when the exercise is ceased. i am assuming you are an active and healthy 27-year-old, so this kind of pain would be sensed by you during moderate physical activity. there are other origins of this kind of chest pain. and if it is food-related, then the highest probability is that it has a digestive tract origin. i would recommend you a consult with a gastrohepatologist (digestive tract and liver specialist) to further examine whether this pain is coming from a possible esophageal spasm (the tube that connects the pharynx with the stomach) or it is coming from an abnormal process in the stomach or the early part of the small intestine. an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy may be required for properly assessing these issues. i hope i was of help with my answer. kind regards,"

"a had a molar pulled 6 days ago . it was a difficult pulling , they had to cut the tooth in half to get it out and she had to give me like 6 shots of lidocaine because of my high tolerance of beds . when she was getting the tooth out a wanted to fight because if felt like she was trying to break my jaw . a am still in pain almost a week later and a feel something poking out of my gums not sure what that is . the hole looks gray or green a don to know but it a not pink like when a had my wisdom removed . the tooth that was next to it is also hurting especially when a bite down on it and the gums around that tooth is swollen also now . by face is still a little swollen . the beds they gave me barely works . is this normal ?",1,69450,"hello, the problem u had described is called peritonitis. it means the swollen and painful gums due to erupting tooth. this problem can be prevented by proper cleaning of region and use of mouthwashes. if the problem is recurrent in nature then a radiograph is taken to find out the position of erupting tooth and its eruption angle. later on as per radiographic findings the treatment is carried out. either extraction of erupting wisdom tooth or simple operculectomy to expose the erupting tooth. sometime cheek bite is caused by upper and lower wisdom tooth due to wrong angulation of their cusps at that time both upper and lower teeth needs to be removed.if pus formation is there u need to take antibiotics and analgesics to treat infection immediately."

"a am taking rigevidon , and have heard that by starting a new pack after finishing the previous one you can delay your period . a have just begun the new pack of pills , but have now been told not to do this as it will mess up my system and make me more prone to pregnancy . is this true ? will a still be protected during the time a should have my period ? thanks",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"by period is 8 days late . a have mild cramping , mild headsets , feeling sick to stomach but no vomiting . a took 2 home pregnancy test by they came back negative . by cramping is more in my lower stomach but not like an ovary cramp . a stay hungry ... by last period was december 30 , 2011 . would a be pregnant ?",1,33341,"hi, if you came to my clinic with those complaints i would ask you to stop worrying. many women that start using the pills for the first time experience similar problems. i understand that you have taken the inactive pills first and then started on the active pills. also, you have had intercourse only after your period was over that is about 11 days ago. the chances of pregnancy occurring after a single act of unprotected sexual intercourse are only 4%. also, for women that have regular periods the chance of getting pregnant is more if intercourse occurs after 11-12 days since the first day of the period. hence, the chances of getting pregnant are low if you have had contact before this period. you are also having a sick feeling in the stomach and most probably a cramp like feeling. this may be due to the pills as some females take time to get adjusted and may improve with continuous use and by taking the pills with food. the pills are not known to cause any major effect on the baby if they are inadvertently taken in early pregnancy. since you have started taking the active pills late, i would recommend that you use a backup contraceptive measure like condoms, for the next 7 days while you still take the pills to avoid pregnancy. i would be pleased to answer any further queries that you may have, enjoy a wonderful day."

"hello a have been getting a clear lump forming on the top of my mouth just behind my jaw line . it a non painful but annoying , a scratched it and it popped with bloody discharge . it was gone a few days then reappeared .. also there seems to be a harder lump in the same area about the size of a bean split in half but more deep under the tissue of my skin .",1,33931,"hi michele jacobi the first thing that has to be done once you find a lump in the region of the chest wall is to confirm what it is. in your case a biopsy has already been done and let us await its result. you're understanding that cancerous lumps don't bleed after biopsy is correct. but i think your presumption that if it was scar tissue it would have bled is not correct. scar tissue also need not bleed. needle biopsies do not usually cause any bleeding unless a blood vessel is ruptured during the procedure since how long have you noticed this lump. is the size of the lump increasing ? if the biopsy comes as positive for cancer then you will have to undergo a series of investigation to find out he the extent of the disease. ? whether it is confined to the chest wall only or whether it has gone beyond the chest wall to other regions. treatment decision will depend on the results of this if the biopsy comes as negative for cancer then there are 2 options 1- if your physician thinks it is insignificant then you need to follow it up. just keep a check on your lump to see whether it is increasing in size and also get it checked by your physician regularly2- the second option (and my preference) is to do an open biopsy especially if the lump was detected recently and is increasing in size and also if the lump is firm to hard (and not very soft). the reason is needle biopsy can be negative, but this does not always mean there is no cancer especially if the tissue sample taken is not adequate. also time factor is important. you may lose time keeping the lump under follow up to see whether it is increasing in size hope you are satisfied with my reply. anyway don't worry. follow your doctors' advice chat doctor."
