"hie i slept with my boyfriend a we a ago i had stopped taking falcon birth control pills for almost 3 months , i started taking them that night i slept with him , i took them everyday for 5 days and we had sex again and since them i am on the pills , and i am worried that may be i am pregnant , wat are my chances of being pregnant",1,33341,"hi, if you came to my clinic with those complaints i would ask you to stop worrying. many women that start using the pills for the first time experience similar problems. i understand that you have taken the inactive pills first and then started on the active pills. also, you have had intercourse only after your period was over that is about 11 days ago. the chances of pregnancy occurring after a single act of unprotected sexual intercourse are only 4%. also, for women that have regular periods the chance of getting pregnant is more if intercourse occurs after 11-12 days since the first day of the period. hence, the chances of getting pregnant are low if you have had contact before this period. you are also having a sick feeling in the stomach and most probably a cramp like feeling. this may be due to the pills as some females take time to get adjusted and may improve with continuous use and by taking the pills with food. the pills are not known to cause any major effect on the baby if they are inadvertently taken in early pregnancy. since you have started taking the active pills late, i would recommend that you use a backup contraceptive measure like condoms, for the next 7 days while you still take the pills to avoid pregnancy. i would be pleased to answer any further queries that you may have, enjoy a wonderful day."

a am a 53 year old male a little overweight and have copd and is disabled . by of use to stay around 115/75 . the last 2 days it has been going from 113/63 to 159/92 at rest . a have had a few cardio work ups and they are telling me that they done see anything that is wrong . would they be missing something ?,1,90927,"hi, i am chat doctor. i have read your message. i think i can help you. first, the symptoms that you have described are highly suggestive of seizures. here is why- 1. they come in night-seizures are commonly triggered when the patient sleeps or just around the sleep. of course, they can occur at other times too.2. they start from the leg and move up and then spread to the rest of the body.3. the episodes last 3-4 minutes and then resolves. i assume (you have not mentioned it) that it is never remembered by him, the episode that is. i think you should both take it very seriously. there is a high possibility that there is an intracranial problem that he is having which is extending and progressing undetected in the brain just because you do not want to visit a neurologist. i think you should meet a neurologist as soon as possible and request an mri brain (with spectroscopy if needed) and video eeg. if he does turn out to have a pathology, treatment will have to be initiated for the pathology in addition to regular anti-epileptic medicines. i suggest taking a video of these episodes that he is having. it may help convince him that he needs to visit a doctor, and it may be helpful to the doctor in seeing the condition that your husband has. yes, you need to visit a neurologist as soon as possible. ideally, i would also like to know if he has been having headaches for the past years? does he seem to be having episodes where he does not recollect what he has been doing for a certain duration of time? you may need to talk to his colleagues at work and find out if he has been having seizures or any abnormal behavior at work. there is a high chance that he knows that he has been having seizures at work and not telling you about it. i have tried my best to help you. unfortunately, i cannot initiate / suggest medicines as long as the diagnosis is not confirmed because the anti-epileptics may have severe side effects. best of luck,"

"hi i would like to get a suggestion from you . a have got root canal treatment six years back and now i am getting problem with that tooth . food particle are sucking in between the teeth where the crown is placed and getting gum pain . i visited doctor here in boston and the doctor gave me 2 choices . one is to redo the rootcanal , crown lengthening , post followed by a crown and the second choice is go for implantation . can you suggest me which one is good for me ? thank you",1,35390,hi. can understand your concern. as per your complaint you have got two crowns placed and pain after this can be due to either of the following reasons. one reason can be in case if the crowns were placed without root canal treatment of tooth (it is a treatment in which the nerves and blood vessels present in the tooth are cut off either to relieve pain due to infection or as an intentional procedure to avoid complications like pain and sensitivity after crown placement) the preparation of the tooth for seating the crown if done in excess can lead to opening of nerves and when the crown is placed over opened nerves it can cause inflammation of nerve and hence severe pain. in case if the crowns are placed after root canal treatment for an infected tooth pain can be due to persistent infection leading to pus formation and pressure which is not subsided or there is some vital nerve tissue left out in any missed root canal can cause severe pain on crown placement. i would suggest you to consult an endodontist and get evaluated clinically as well as by getting x-ray done to rule out the cause of pain. in case if root canal is not done and pain is due to irritated nerves the crown needs to be removed followed by root canal treatment and medicines and once pain is completely subsided crown can be placed again. in case of root canal treated tooth also re treatment will have to be done. you can take painkiller like eugenic plus or retool dt (one tablet dissolved in half a glass of water) to provide relief. hope your query is solved. if you find the answer helpful please write a positive review and click on find this answer helpful as a token of appreciation. thanks and regards. chat doctor.

(as you said he has difficulty in walking now). you can also say to his parents that --- they can continue with all religious customs along with medicines, may be then they will agree... with medicine, he will start showing improvement in few days only... it is psychosis and patients will not agree to go to any doctor willingly, so you might need to take him forcefully. this is well accepted as it is for his benefit only. even if he doesn't agree for oral medicine there are injectables which are given to such patients... take the right step, take him to a doctor. hope the reply is useful feel free to ask more questions"

"a had an fri an was told a had fluid in a sinus cavity . it a 2 weeks later , a had steroids and antibiotic , an have a horrible sinus infection . a also have pain in my gums above 1 front tooth , a woke up one morning with a real bitter taste in mouth . is this all related ?",1,22667,"dear patient, i can understand your concern and feel sorry for the pain you are suffering from. you are informing me that when you got the upper molar extracted, the dentist told you that the bone between the sinus and tooth is destroyed and sinus cavity is open. roots of upper molar often are found inside the maxillary sinus, which causes opening of the sinus cavity while extraction of the tooth, creating an oro-antral fistula, that is a direct connection between oral cavity and sinus cavity. in this case, the food or water you take has chances of passing infection in the sinus through mouth and the infection does not resolve. it is mandatory to close this connection between mouth and the sinus. it could be done by the dentist by taking stitches in the area when he found that sinus has opened, but it can also be done now. however, as about 2 weeks has passed since extraction, the opening would not be as much clear as it would have been during extraction. a blood clot may have filled the area. so what you need to do now is, go to an oral surgeon or an ent specialist. i know you have insurance problem, but there seems no other solution to your problem. you might have to go for x-rays and probably ct scan of the area to diagnose if oro-antral fistula actually exists and if it does, you might have to go for a little surgery to close the communication between mouth and sinus followed by antibiotics to resolve the infection. i hope this information helps. thank you for choosing chat doctor. i wish you get well soon. best,"

"i , a noticed a while ago a had a tiny red dot ( size of a pinhead ) on my gums right at the base on my front lower tooth . it does not hurt and does not bleed . by gums are in good condition and a get regular check ups . any idea what it could be ? when a looked closer , it almost looks like my gum is red with some broken blood vessel or something . thanks !",1,53390,hi. can understand your concern. as per your complaint the swollen gum and the white material inside it is a result of some inflammation. there can be a few reasons depending upon whether it is the second molar or the wisdom tooth. in case it is a wisdom tooth which is erupting or is impacted then the gum above it can get infected and inflamed due to either food deposition between the gum and the wisdom tooth or it can be due to gum flap bitten by the opposite jaw tooth and the condition is known as peritonitis. the white material in it is pus. in case it is second molar the swollen gum with white material in it can be as a result of infection in the gums due to deposits on the teeth like plaque or calculus or due to foreign body impaction in the gums which carries infection along with it deeper into the gums causing pus formation. it can also be due to deeply infected tooth causing pus formation below the tips of the roots of the tooth causing swelling on the gums with pus inside. i would suggest you to consult a dentist and get evaluated for the exact cause of the swelling and get treated accordingly. in case if it is wisdom tooth either excision of gum flap or extraction if the tooth is impacted followed by antibiotics and painkillers can be done. in case of gum infection professional cleaning of teeth followed by antibiotics and gum paints can help. in case of tooth infection root canal treatment or extraction depending on the condition of the tooth can be done. hope your query is solved. if you find the answer helpful please write a positive review and click on find this answer helpful as a token of appreciation. thanks and regards. chat doctor.

(we call this osmosis phenomenon). for this effect, we need to check the blood sugar at midnight around 2am or so. if this midnight glucose level is very low, then we have to decrease your night insulin levels. therefore, the best for you is to go immediately to your treating doctor and adjust the insulin dose you are taking. regards"

by father is a river cirrhosis patient.it is started 4 years back & it was minor.he used to go to doctor & do all the test.this time doctor said afp is more ( 208 ) & increasing afp is not good.please suggest is it a dangerous situation.what & where the best treatment available .,1,5228,"hi, how are you? i am sorry to hear about your fathers' diagnosis of cirrhosis. afp (alpha photo protein) is a substance normally produced by the fetal liver when it is in the uterus. once the baby is born, the liver stops producing this substance so that in an adult the levels of afp in the blood will be very low. unfortunately, if there is a liver tumor growing, then this tumor starts to produce afp and hence its level in the blood increases. so if there is a sudden increase in the blood levels of afp, especially in a cirrhotic patient, it could potentially point to the development of a tumor in the liver. this needs to be evaluated with imaging studies, an ultrasound to start with, and then with a tri-phasic contrast enhanced ct scan of the liver. the treatment options will depend on size and number of tumors and also the general condition of the patient. the best treatment for patients with cirrhosis and liver tumor is liver transplant provided they meet some criteria. if the tumor is small, then percutaneous ablative techniques or even resection of a small segment of liver in which the tumor is located can also be done. please do let me know where you are located, so i can guide you to the best center for treatment. hope this helps and hope your dad feels better. please do not hesitate to contact me for further details - rxsuresh@gmail.com"

"i have got irregular periods and took treatment for that .. i was given clomiphene for induction .. on day 16 follicle on it was 20mm .. my partner is in different state .. we mated on my day 17 .. on day 20 , follicle ruptured and there was free fluid in pod .. my doubt is that when could have ovulation taken place ? for how many days after ovulation will there be fluid in pod ? posts answer me",1,13108,"hi, i appreciate your query would clarify the report of your follicular study to you. on the 9th day, in the right and left ovaries (of and lof) - there was no df - which means, dominant follicle. again the same findings persisted till the 13th day, that is there was no dominant follicle in any of the ovaries. et - refers to endometrial thickness which was 8 mm on day 13. collection in pod was nil, which is normal. now, to explain a normal follicular study to you. by day 9, the ovaries start producing dominant follicles, that is among the many eggs present in the ovaries, one starts maturing to develop into the dominant egg for that month. by day 13 generally, if you have a regular 28-day menstrual cycle, the dominant egg reaches a size of 20 - 22 mm. generally on day 14, ovulation occurs, that is the mature dominant egg is released from the ovary, and it is then ready for fertilization by the sperm. this is the normal studyhowever, in your case, there is no dominant follicle seen till day 13, which means that you are having an ovulatory cycle. that is, no mature egg is developing for ovulation this month. anovulatory cycles are a major cause for not being able to conceive.pod (polycystic ovarian disease) is one of the leading causes of an ovulation, apart from other conditions. you need to consult a gynecologist, and undergo further investigations for pod to rule out the cause of this follicular study. also, you might require treatment and ovulation induction (medicines to stimulate formation of follicles in the ovary). in case your cycles are delayed (longer than 28 - 30 days), there is a minor possibility that your follicles are maturing later than normal, for e.g., in a 35-day cycle, the day of ovulation would be 14 days before periods, that is on day 20 or 21. hope this helped you."

"hi my name is she . a have a question ? a have irregular period each month and some months there a no period at all and last time a went to see my doctor he prescribe my primolut which were taken during two weeks and then after that a got heavy period then after 3day was back to normal , and a am trying to get pregnant too . an a suggest me something i can take and ovulate as well",1,95284,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. if you have not taken your birth control pills for two weeks and are having unprotected intercourse, it is possible that you could have become pregnant. any woman of reproductive age who is not using contraception and having sex theoretically can get pregnant. some women do have some spotting a few days after conception if the fertilized egg implants in the uterus, which is known as implantation bleeding. however, the majority of women do not bleed at all when they conceive, and pregnancy symptoms really do not start until the pregnancy is large enough to produce hormones, which really takes a few weeks after conception. furthermore, is not unusual to have irregular bleeding and spotting after discontinuing birth control pills as well. so at this point, the only thing that you can do is wait until your menstrual period is due, and if your period is late, to perform a urine pregnancy test. modern urine pregnancy test become positive within 10 days to two weeks after conception, so in a few weeks you will be able to reliably test to see if you conceived. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was helpful. best of luck in getting pregnant,"

"maybe about 6 or 7 years ago i was diagnosed with hepatitis a and mild liver damage . a also have the upper part of my body done every year . this is where the doctor checks my stomach ? why a do not know . to , my question is what does it mean when he states that my liver is stable ?",1,5256,"hi, how are you? my name is chat doctor. thanks for writing to chat doctor and i hope to answer your question today. hepatitis c virus, as i am sure you are aware, damages the liver cells. the liver has an enormous capacity to regenerate, meaning if part of the liver is damaged, then new liver cells are formed to replace the damaged liver (unlike skin where damaged skin is replaced by scar). the problem with hepatitis c is, it is present constantly in the blood and liver and continues to damage the liver continuously. just like a rubber band can be stretched only so far before it snaps, so is the regenerative capacity of the liver. depending on how virulent the hepatitis c strain is, over the course of 10-30 yrs, the liver exhausts its capacity to regenerate and just like skin, the damaged liver cells starts getting replaced by scar tissue - this leads to hardening of the normal supple liver - a condition known as liver fibrosis which later on leads to liver cirrhosis. the problem with this is, under normal circumstances anywhere between 1200 and 1500 ml of blood flows through the liver per min. when the liver is normal and supple, this blood can flow easily through the liver. but when the liver begins to stiffen or harden as in the case of cirrhosis, this blood is met with great resistance during its flow through the liver. this is called as ""portal hypertension"". so the blood starts to look for alternate routes to return to the heart and the most accessible route for it is through the veins of the food pipe (esophagus and stomach). the problem with this is, the veins in the esophagus and stomach are very thin walled and are not used to carrying this much volume of blood. so they distend to a great degree (a condition called as varices) and sometime even rupture with catastrophic consequences. this is easily diagnosed by upper gi endoscopy where the largely dilated veins can be seen. but in your case, since multiple upper gi endoscopies have not demonstrated any varices, it means your liver has not reached a state of ""portal hypertension"" yet and the disease seems not be progressing or is ""stable"". if i was your doctor, i would also get a ""fibrosis"" which is a special scan of the liver to look at the amount of stiffness or hardening of the liver. this can be repeated regularly to see the progression of the fibrosis. i would also explore the different treatments for hepatitis c infection. the gold standard is of course a liver biopsy which will demonstrate the exact status of your liver. i hope this helped, and i do hope you will get better soon. please write back to me if you need any further clarifications especially the treatment options available to treat hepatitis c. have a great day"

"yes a recently had a cat scan done on my liver it says that a have mild diffuse hepatic stenosis , the main portal vein is mildly prominent measuring 16,6 my did and the spleen is mildly enlarge at 13.4 pm and possible portal venous hypertension should a be concern",1,87329,"hi, thanks for writing in to us. splenomegaly is a common complication of cirrhosis. many cirrhotics have platelet counts in the 60,000s. it is not something to worry about. and it doesn't need to be treated. you have plenty of platelets to properly clot your blood. blood flows from the spleen...through the portal vein...then through the liver. scar tissue in the liver (cirrhosis) can interfere with that blood flow, causing pressure to build up in the portal vein (portal hypertension), and the spleen to enlarge (splenomegaly). as the spleen enlarges, it traps platelets. (the amount of platelets in the bloodstream is reduced because the spleen is busy trapping them). so usually people with cirrhosis end up having a problem with portal hypertension and an enlarged spleen, and a reduced platelet count in the bloodstream. as time goes by, the liver may try to repair itself by growing new cells. if there is a lot of scar tissue already present the new cells grow between scar tissue (and result in abnormal nodules). the nodules and scar tissue further interfere with blood flow through the liver. so over time people with advanced cirrhosis can end up having a problem with more and more abnormal nodules and scar tissue forming which interferes even more with blood flow through the liver which makes the spleen continue to enlarge, and the platelet count continue to chat doctor. the splenomegaly is usually not reversible. please go for regular medical follow up. hope this helps"

a have been on birth control pill for about 3months and last week when a was supposed to take placebo pills but instead a skipped them and started a new sheet . now my period has been late by about 4days and pm starting to freak out if in pregnant or a just skipped a period . a have no spitting or bleeding whatsoever . to a have a high chance of being pregnant ?,1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"
a have been on birth control pill for about 3months and last week when a was supposed to take placebo pills but instead a skipped them and started a new sheet . now my period has been late by about 4days and pm starting to freak out if in pregnant or a just skipped a period . a have no spitting or bleeding whatsoever . to a have a high chance of being pregnant ?,2,26444,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, i want to reassure you that if you have been taking your birth control pills as directed and you didn't miss any that the chances of your being pregnant are tiny. the failure rate of birth control pills in general is about 1 in 200 per year, meaning one out of 200 women has a chance of getting pregnant on the pill over the course of a year. many women can miss periods for reasons not due to pregnancy. your period can be affected by diet, traveling or changes in your schedule, and especially stress. even worrying about pregnancy can cause enough stress to delay your cycle. also, some women stop menstruating completely when they have been on the pill for a long time, especially low-dose pills like the microgynon you are taking. i suggest you purchase a urine pregnancy test (the over-the-counter ones are just as accurate as a doctor's office) and follow the package directions. if you are not pregnant, you can just wait and see what happens with your cycle and even if you never bleed just start your new pack on time, and you will be protected against pregnancy. if your irregular periods continue to bother you, you may want to see your gun provider who may be able to prescribe a different pill for you that may help you have predictable cycles. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"i pm 17 years old and very worried had unprotected sex with my boyfriend , ( a am on minerva 35 ) and pm a constant user of the pill , never miss a day , though a have a paranoia about pregnancy and have been having the urge to urinate frequently and am moody , can a be pregnant ? ? please help , a always take my pill right on time",1,26444,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, i want to reassure you that if you have been taking your birth control pills as directed and you didn't miss any that the chances of your being pregnant are tiny. the failure rate of birth control pills in general is about 1 in 200 per year, meaning one out of 200 women has a chance of getting pregnant on the pill over the course of a year. many women can miss periods for reasons not due to pregnancy. your period can be affected by diet, traveling or changes in your schedule, and especially stress. even worrying about pregnancy can cause enough stress to delay your cycle. also, some women stop menstruating completely when they have been on the pill for a long time, especially low-dose pills like the microgynon you are taking. i suggest you purchase a urine pregnancy test (the over-the-counter ones are just as accurate as a doctor's office) and follow the package directions. if you are not pregnant, you can just wait and see what happens with your cycle and even if you never bleed just start your new pack on time, and you will be protected against pregnancy. if your irregular periods continue to bother you, you may want to see your gun provider who may be able to prescribe a different pill for you that may help you have predictable cycles. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

a have allergies lately since working a new job in a concrete commercial building where there is a karate academy and lot of children . since working there a have had a tickle in throat everyday for about 6 weeks . a also notice after 6 weeks that the coughing is causing me to urinate its constant now and totally embarrassing ? that can a do ?,1,40521,"there are no many studies which prove the relation between masturbation and shrinkage of testicles. the issue is linked with your body building. there can be a few reasons behind this. when you exercise, your circulatory system makes adaptations that result in the shunting of oxygenated blood pumped from the heart toward the working muscles in the arms, legs and trunk. in fact, while 20 percent of cardiac output passes through the muscles at rest, 80 percent is fed through the muscles during all-out exercise. since there is only so much blood to go around, this shunting occurs at the expense of tissues not in immediately in need of heavy oxygenation, including the genitals. as a result of diminished blood flow, the penis and testicles appear to shrink during and after heavy exercise.also, if you had used injected testosterone for your body building, then definitely, that is the reason. you need not do anything right now, as your testicles have regained its size, there is nothing to worry. continue with regular exercise, however, strenuous work out should be avoided."

"hello dear doctor , i guess i had an unprotected sex on saturday night around 4 am . then i took morning after pills around 11pm and 6 pills of vitamin a each day . this happened 4 days after my the start of my period.is there any chance of pregnancy ?",1,41925,"hallow dear, from your history, i understand that you had not inserted your penis inside the vagina, nor did you ejaculate on he vaginal opening. however, pre-ejaculation secretions come out unknowingly and contain some sperms which are capable of fertilizing an ovum. though she has taken unwanted 72, post-coital emergency contraceptive pills, she has consumed them rather late - after 6 days. these pills are very effective emergency contraceptive pills if taken within 72 hours of the unprotected sex. now the key factor is when did you have this venture of unprotected sex! the egg is released (ovulation)14 days prior to the next expected menses. the egg has life of 24 hours while the sperms are active for 72 hours. therefore, a period of about one week around the day of ovulation is fertile period. if you had your sex during fertile period, the chance of pregnancy would be high. so do your calculation of the days to find out the risk of pregnancy. now you have to wait expectantly for her menses to appear. one hitch in this also is that after unwanted 72 pills, there is a possibility of delaying period by about a week or so. so the best option for you is if at all she misses her period, about 3 weeks after this incidence of sex, get her pregnancy test done on the overnight first morning urine sample; done earlier, these test may give false negative results. alternatively, you may opt for beta chat doctor test which gives reliable results even few days before missing a period. if she is pregnant, you have an option of medical termination of pregnancy till 9 weeks of gestation. to avoid such stressful situations in the future, please practice reliable contraceptive methods like birth control pills, condom or intrauterine device. i hope this helps you."
"hello dear doctor , i guess i had an unprotected sex on saturday night around 4 am . then i took morning after pills around 11pm and 6 pills of vitamin a each day . this happened 4 days after my the start of my period.is there any chance of pregnancy ?",2,7307,"hi, welcome to chat doctor. i am chat doctor. i will be answering your concerns today. from your notes it appears that you started contraceptive pills without your periods. i hope that you have done pregnancy test and ruled out pregnancy before starting contraceptive pills. contraceptive pills are effective in preventing pregnancy from day 8 of starting the pills when you start them at any time in a period cycle. so if you have had unprotected sex after a week of starting the pill, you are protected. the chances of pregnancy are almost nil. if you have had sex within a week of starting the pill, then there is a possibility of pregnancy. the chances of pregnancy are about 20% (one in five). i hope this is helpful."
"hello dear doctor , i guess i had an unprotected sex on saturday night around 4 am . then i took morning after pills around 11pm and 6 pills of vitamin a each day . this happened 4 days after my the start of my period.is there any chance of pregnancy ?",3,51937,"hallow dear, there are few issues in your query which need clarification to you. let me explain one by one.1. if you miss just one pill during whole cycle of birth control pills, the effect of the pills remains, and they do not fail. so the chances of pregnancy are almost nil due to missing of one pill.2. on 6th day of the menstrual cycle, there is no egg present for the fertilization. the egg is released (ovulation) 14 days prior to next expected menses. the egg has life of 24 hours while the sperms are active for 72 hours. hence, a period of about one week around the day of ovulation is the fertile period. unprotected sexual intercourse in the fertile period is most likely to result in pregnancy. your intercourse was far away from fertile period. 3. there only one method by which you can reliably detect pregnancy just one day after missing period; and that is beta chat doctor test. this test can diagnose pregnancy even few days before missing period. the other home pregnancy tests which are performed on urine are reliable 8-10 days after missed period. earlier, they may give false negative results. 4. if you had diarrhea after doxycycline (which is a common side effect of these antibiotics), there is a chance that pills could have got expelled before complete absorption and then the pills may fail to offer protection from the pregnancy. i hope this helps you."

a have been in closed for 2 cycles now on my third but last month a started three days before my expected period a a usually a 28 day cycle . when a just started on friday witch would be 2 days before my expected period this time it was dark brown and kinda heavy then stopped today witch is sunday could a be pregnant or was it my period a started my 3rd round if closed also the day a started,1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"by last period was on14th dec 2010 . a found out a was pregnant on the 17th an 2010 . due to some abdominal pain a was offered to do a internal ultra sound . the ultra sound showed gestational sac measuring 1.6 my , chatdoctor levels 420 . in 4th feb 2011 gestational sac measured at 6.5 my with a yolk sac but no baby . a was told that a was probably having a miscarriage as the sac was only measuring at four weeks instead of seven and my chatdoctor levels were 2000 . is it possible that this could still be a viable pregnancy ?",1,86888,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. seeing just a gestational sac without a fetus or fetal pole is not normal at 8 weeks gestation. if the sac is small (less than 2 cm) there is a possibility that the pregnancy is just younger than you expect and that a fetus could still develop.however, if the sac is of sufficient size (over 1.5-2 cm) and there is no fetus present it is most likely an early pregnancy failure (miscarriage that has not yet come out). correlation with your pregnancy hormone levels can also give more information. however, it cannot hurt to wait and see another 2 weeks just to make sure, as not every pregnancy follows the expected patterns of development. but you should be prepared as the greatest likelihood is that this is not a normal pregnancy if the sac is large enough. one in 10 pregnancies end in miscarriage, and nothing can be done to prevent one if a fetus never develops in the first place. however, that means that if you try again, 90% of the time everything will be fine. i hope i was able to answer your question and this advice was reassuring. best of luck for the rest of the pregnancy,"

"okay , so i have just taken my fourth sugar pill - in on birth control and have been for over a year . a had sexual intercourse 5 days ago , and the only thing i have been feeling is queasy since very late last night when i started worrying that i could be pregnant . the intercourse was protected , there was a condom and my partner says he did to blow into me . a still haven to got my period . that do a do ?",1,33341,"hi, if you came to my clinic with those complaints i would ask you to stop worrying. many women that start using the pills for the first time experience similar problems. i understand that you have taken the inactive pills first and then started on the active pills. also, you have had intercourse only after your period was over that is about 11 days ago. the chances of pregnancy occurring after a single act of unprotected sexual intercourse are only 4%. also, for women that have regular periods the chance of getting pregnant is more if intercourse occurs after 11-12 days since the first day of the period. hence, the chances of getting pregnant are low if you have had contact before this period. you are also having a sick feeling in the stomach and most probably a cramp like feeling. this may be due to the pills as some females take time to get adjusted and may improve with continuous use and by taking the pills with food. the pills are not known to cause any major effect on the baby if they are inadvertently taken in early pregnancy. since you have started taking the active pills late, i would recommend that you use a backup contraceptive measure like condoms, for the next 7 days while you still take the pills to avoid pregnancy. i would be pleased to answer any further queries that you may have, enjoy a wonderful day."

a have gas pains in my lower abdomen and a slight pinching feeling by my ovaries . a am 2 days late for my period . a have been slightly cases and my breasts are tender ( which often happens before my period ) . a am sexually active but use a condom every time . a took a pregnancy test and it came back negative .,1,75785,"hello dear, i understand your concern. in my opinion the delayed menstruation in a sexually active woman needs to rule out pregnancy. the delayed period with sore breasts first gives a suspicion of pregnancy. but it is confirmed by doing a urine pregnancy test. usually a urine pregnancy test gives accurate results a week after missed period. if you have done the test within the stipulated time above and the test is negative there might be no pregnancy. but anyway i suggest you to repeat the test after a week. if the repeat test is also negative then there might be no chance of pregnancy. and the sore breasts might be a premenstrual symptom. then the delay in period can be considered due to hormonal imbalance. the hormonal imbalance might be due to stress regarding pregnancy or anything. so relax. avoid stress. if the test is negative wait for spontaneous onset of periods for a week or 10 days. and if still there is no onset of period even then consult gynecologist. nothing to worry as such. hope this helps. best regards...."

"a have been getting intermittent pain in my upper left arm , in the back that comes and goes and almost has a `` balloon '' type sharp pain where it gets stronger and then goes away , but then comes back especially when a move it certain ways . a was sitting at my desk when it started though",1,77921,"most people who have gallstones do not have symptoms. if you have symptoms, you most likely will have mild pain in the pit of your stomach or in the upper right part of your belly. pain may spread to your right upper back or shoulder blade area. sometimes the pain is more severe. it may be steady, or it may come and go. or it may get worse when you eat. you may decide to go to the doctor because of pain in your belly. in this case, your doctor will ask you questions about when the pain started, where it is, and if it comes and goes or is always there. your doctor may order imaging tests. these take pictures of the inside of your body. an ultrasound of the belly is the best test to find gallstones. this test does not hurt. your ultrasound may not show gallstones. but if your doctor still thinks you have a problem with your gallbladder, he or she may order a gallbladder scan. in this test, a doctor injects dye into a vein in your arm. then a machine takes x-rays as the dye moves through your liver, bile duct, gallbladder, and intestine. if you do not have symptoms, you probably do not need treatment. if your first gallstone attack causes mild pain, your doctor may tell you to take pain medicine and wait to see if the pain goes away. you may never have another attack. waiting to see what happens usually will not cause problems. if you have a bad attack, or if you have a second attack, you may want to have your gallbladder removed. a second attack means you are more likely to have future attacks. many people have their gallbladders removed, and the surgery usually goes well. doctors most often use laparoscopic surgery. for this, your surgeon will make small cuts in your belly and remove your gallbladder. you will probably be able to go back to work or your normal routine in a week or two, but it may take longer for some people. sometimes the surgeon will have to make a larger cut to remove the gallbladder. it will take longer for you to recover from this type of surgery. regards and take care"

"a recently went to the of without insurance and was found to have had gastritis and symptoms of anxiety . a be since received a letter in the mail indicating that a need a follow up due to lab work demonstrating elevated liver enzymes and calcium . there were red cells found in the urinalysis . by question is , what do you recommend a do to have these tests done and what possible problems might a be facing given these test results ? a don to want to ignore my health but the bill a have from that of visit is nearly $ 5,000 and a haven to a penny to spare . thank you",1,19690,hello and thank you for sending your question. you are a very young person and the degree of anemia that you are experiencing is such that appropriate medical examination consultation and diagnostic testing is warranted. this includes endoscopy which you have already completed. you have indicated that the endoscopy has not showed any obvious signs of bleeding but that you do have a diverticulosis. it is possible that diverticulosis can contribute to anemia if one of the diverticula becomes inflamed and bleeds. this might not cause obvious changes in your stool but could contribute to mild anemia. since nothing obvious has been found it would be reasonable to consider additional work up with the gastroenterologist including upper endoscopy and possible capsule endoscopy if the upper endoscopy is negative. if the gastroenterology workup is negative the next step would be to review your blood test results with a hematologist. the hematologist will help to make sure that there is no problem with production of red blood cells or abnormal destruction of red blood cells in your body. i think it is worth the investment of time and money to have this worked up completely. thanks again for sending your question.

a went to the dentist last week and had a rays and a thorough cleaning/check up . by jaw has been sore ever since and a came down with a terrible cold/sinus infection . would these be related to having my mouth open for so long or to the bacteria that was released during the cleaning ?,1,22667,"dear patient, i can understand your concern and feel sorry for the pain you are suffering from. you are informing me that when you got the upper molar extracted, the dentist told you that the bone between the sinus and tooth is destroyed and sinus cavity is open. roots of upper molar often are found inside the maxillary sinus, which causes opening of the sinus cavity while extraction of the tooth, creating an oro-antral fistula, that is a direct connection between oral cavity and sinus cavity. in this case, the food or water you take has chances of passing infection in the sinus through mouth and the infection does not resolve. it is mandatory to close this connection between mouth and the sinus. it could be done by the dentist by taking stitches in the area when he found that sinus has opened, but it can also be done now. however, as about 2 weeks has passed since extraction, the opening would not be as much clear as it would have been during extraction. a blood clot may have filled the area. so what you need to do now is, go to an oral surgeon or an ent specialist. i know you have insurance problem, but there seems no other solution to your problem. you might have to go for x-rays and probably ct scan of the area to diagnose if oro-antral fistula actually exists and if it does, you might have to go for a little surgery to close the communication between mouth and sinus followed by antibiotics to resolve the infection. i hope this information helps. thank you for choosing chat doctor. i wish you get well soon. best,"

"hi , i had a miscarriage in aug 2010 , and before that i mean in pregnancy i want to sex again and again , i had orgasm and after that i had a miscarriage , but know my days are above but i did not have a urine test for pregnancy . i am scared but again i am feeling my clitoris is active and i want to do sex . what should i do know ? is it dangerous to have an orgasm in pregnancy ?",1,448,"hello and i hope i can help you today.first, i want to reassure you that it is not possible that you could have conceived if you had unprotected sex before your implant was removed. implanon is nearly 100 percent effective in preventing pregnancy while it is in place, and it takes time for you to ovulate again (at least 7-10 days) after it is removed. so if you only had unprotected sex immediately before and after your implant was removed, it is unlikely you could have conceived so quickly. pregnancy symptoms vary widely between women, and many of the same symptoms we commonly associate with pregnancy such as nausea, bloating, breast tenderness, headaches and irregular bleeding can also happen from an irregular menstrual cycle as well as pregnancy. many women have irregular periods after discontinuing a hormonal birth control method. so, i suggest you wait for your period, which should occur around 4 weeks after your implant removal, and if you miss your period, a urine pregnancy test will be accurate at this time. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful. best wishes,"

"this is john , a am from ohio . can a ask you a question when a have sex with my wife when a cum inside her a do see all my sperm come out why is that , but a am 9 inches long with my penis . what is a health color for sprem. ? a am sorry about a stupid question ...",1,36900,"hi, i guess your concern is wife not getting pregnant after 2 yrs of marriage, right? i got the picture what you are going through. don't worry i am here to help you sir. let's start discussing with the information you have shared with us. when you were a kid you got operated at penis. then heard the doctor saying you may not become a father. but sir what kind of operation it is? you haven't shared, or you may not be knowing as you were kid at that time. so cant say whether that operation is causing this problem. anyway let's keep this kid operation aside. you haven't shared how old is your wife? what her exact age is? is it a late marriage. if it's a late marriage then getting pregnant takes some time sir. have patience. women from 18-40 years of reproductive age group, the chances of pregnancy are high, after 50 years, chances of pregnancy are very less, and 42-45-transition zone, chances are not as high as reproductive age neither as less than after 50 years. you have to judge where wife stands, where? i would like to focus on the medical term-fertile period. it is from 10th-16th day of menses cycle where chances of becoming pregnant are very, very high. here sperm fertilizes ovum and women become pregnant, that's why it's called fertile period. well, with above discussion you can try out my suggestions:1. have patience, things will settle down slowly.2. i insist you and your wife to do sex in fertile period (mechanism i have told above). do this for next 6-8 months. you will get results by this time.3. if you are in a hurry, or you want to really know is that your kid operation is hindering you from becoming father, you can visit your nearby gynecologist or infertility specialist for sorting of things. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"by friend had tuberculosis few months ago and underwent for medical treatment , what happened was a accidentally drink in his water container thinking that was mine since were having the same container . is there any chance that a may get the disease ? ? ?",1,30885,"hi, thanks for writing in. you might be one of the lucky few who had a serious head injury at a younger age and have recovered without any residual symptoms. encephalomalacia means softening of the brain. this happens when there is injury to the brain and absent blood supply and consequently resulting in loss of brain matter and cerebrospinal fluid occupies the area after the shrinkage of that part of the brain. since it has happened more than 40 years ago, and you might have been much younger at that time, the brain circuits that were damaged were realigned, and your affected brain was compensated for its loss in functions. at a young age the brain learns to cope up with its limitations in a better way. this is called neuroplasticity. neuroplasticity allows the neurons (nerve cells) in the brain to compensate for injury and disease and to adjust their activities in response to new situations or to changes in their environment. therefore, you have been normal throughout your life."
"by friend had tuberculosis few months ago and underwent for medical treatment , what happened was a accidentally drink in his water container thinking that was mine since were having the same container . is there any chance that a may get the disease ? ? ?",2,12666,"thanks for your question on chat doctor. i can understand your concern. since your friend had tuberculosis in the past, possibility of scar tissue on recent x-ray is more. tb lesion heals by either fibrosis or calcification. and it appears as scar tissue on chest x-ray. this lesion appears as it is for lifelong. so possibility of scar lesion is more in his case. but at the same time, tuberculosis can reactivate and cause active tuberculosis in the same lesion. so if your friend is symptomatic (fever, cough, weight loss) than better to get done sputum examination for afb and ct thorax. if both these are normal for active tb lesion than no need to worry about tuberculosis at present and his x-ray is showing scar tissue only. hope i have solved your query. wishing good health to your friend. thanks."

"i , my names aimee , a was diagnosed with fibermyalga , now a read a recent x-ray and it says spin bifid occult a s1 . a kinda knew that a didst have fibermyalga because the pain is always in my back and hips . is bad back and hip pain normal with so ? , and learning disabilities ? and mood disorders ? is all that normal with so ?",1,44020,"i'm sorry to hear about your pain and how it is affecting you physical activity. now hip pain can be tricky. many times patients feel they have hip pain when actually the pain is from the sacroiliac joint. to differentiate, first imagine where you would point to if someone asked you where the most pain occurs. if the pain is in the groin and worsened with walking, climbing stairs, getting in and out of the car or a seat, it is likely hip joint pain. if the pain is actually out to the side and above your buttocks (picture someone placing their hands on their ""hips""), it is likely sacroiliac joint pain. many times patients with sacroiliac joint pain can have symptoms radiate down the leg, while hip pain typically radiates into the groin and sometimes to the same sided knee. the best way to figure the problem out is to have a x-ray of your hip and also of your low back and sacroiliac joint. i hope this answer is helpful. in either case, the good news is that stretching, anti-inflammatory medications and even a joint injection can be very helpful. i hope you feel better and get out golfing again soon!"

"a have a daughter , 9 years old . red blood is coming with stool from 2 days . the does not like green vegetables . the always like to eat chicken . the is taken histamine from 4 month due to large problem . al give your valuable suggestion to the blood.thanks",1,38727,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. one of the ways that you can possibly figure out where the bleeding is coming from is by putting a tampon inside. if, while wearing the tampon, you still see blood on your underwear then the bleeding is coming from your rectum. in that case, there is less to worry about as it is most likely from your hemorrhoids. to reduce the chances of your hemorrhoids causing bleeding, eat lots of fruits and vegetables and chat doctor. this will not harm the baby, but will rather make your stool softer said it is easier for you to have a bowel movement. if the tampon has blood on it than the bleeding definitely is coming from vagina. a small amount of bleeding can happen during late pregnancy as your cervix starts to soften to eventually prepare for labor. however, this type of blood should be dark brown or purple and mixed with mucus. if you are having bright red blood coming from your vagina, i would call your doctor for advice. if you have any risk factors for bleeding during pregnancy; such as being on blood thinners, having a low-lying or placenta prefix, or experiencing any other symptoms like uterine contractions it might be prudent for you to go to an emergency room for evaluation. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

hello or samuel what is indeterminate activity in diagnosed pub 2 years ago and go for treatment for 6 months . but 2 years i go for my medical exam applying work in abroad and the result is right upper lobe ill defined opacities.this may represent pulmonary tuberculosis of indeterminate activity what does it means ?,1,95176,"hi, thanks for writing in. a 4 mm lesion in the breast is too small to characterize. the needle fnac was offered probably to be more accurate in making a diagnosis. if the lump of cells in the 4 mm area was properly targeted then appearance of liquid confirms the presence of a cyst with fluid. even in the aspirated fluid, there would have been cells and i guess that slides were prepared and seen under a microscope in your case. if it was indeterminate then it means that no cancer cells were confirmed in the area. technically speaking even if the 4 mm area was burst with the needle then the cells were confined to a closed area and will not spill over to any other area. also, it might have been close to the skin surface. please be informed that breast cancer does not have a tendency to spread by a needle track. therefore, you are completely safe from this procedure. keeping in mind the indeterminate nature of the fluid from the cyst it is advisable to go for regular clinical examinations and also do self breast exam once every 15 days and consult your doctor should you have any doubts regarding any new breast lumps. please do not worry."

hello a used to suffer from panic attacks in the past and was prescribed fluoxitine . that sorted the problem out : its now a couple of years later and a have since emigrated to another country and life is quite tricky and hard and a feel a am getting bogged down with stress daily again . a wonder if a could order myself some more fluoxitine online and start taking it again ? cheers,1,44020,"i'm sorry to hear about your pain and how it is affecting you physical activity. now hip pain can be tricky. many times patients feel they have hip pain when actually the pain is from the sacroiliac joint. to differentiate, first imagine where you would point to if someone asked you where the most pain occurs. if the pain is in the groin and worsened with walking, climbing stairs, getting in and out of the car or a seat, it is likely hip joint pain. if the pain is actually out to the side and above your buttocks (picture someone placing their hands on their ""hips""), it is likely sacroiliac joint pain. many times patients with sacroiliac joint pain can have symptoms radiate down the leg, while hip pain typically radiates into the groin and sometimes to the same sided knee. the best way to figure the problem out is to have a x-ray of your hip and also of your low back and sacroiliac joint. i hope this answer is helpful. in either case, the good news is that stretching, anti-inflammatory medications and even a joint injection can be very helpful. i hope you feel better and get out golfing again soon!"

i ave been on libido injections for the past 6 months as a was put on them by my consultant as he said cd never gone through puberty properly because of low testosterone . to basically my question is how long will all the changes take ? its just ave met somebody recently but ave always been very reluctant to get into a relationship as a wouldn't be able to have sex/get an erection . to a was wondering how long does it take till a can start getting erections and engaging in intercourse,1,4054,"greetingswelcome to chat doctor. wound remaining open for 5 months is a very long time indeed and i completely understand how much pain you daughter much be feeling. well here it is important to know here what surgery was done initially so that the underlying problem can be identified which could be causing the wound to remain open. secondly to really find out if the wound is uninfected you will have to visit you doctor because infected would doesn't necessarily mean lots of pus. as far as the advice of you doctor is concerned to undergo a surgery, i say it would be a wise decision because no matter what medication your daughter takes or how clean you keep the wound, the wound will not heal if the ends of the wound have not been approximated. this will quickly start the healing process with very good antibiotics with broad spectrum coverage. she might be reluctant, but if you counsel her that surgical intervention again has good chances of healing your wound, i am sure she will be ready. after all it's going to be under general anesthesia and she wouldn't feel a thing. i hope the answer was helpful. in case you have any further questions feel free to contact in writing. regards. chat doctor."

"a recently had a left alt level of 77 and serum it level of 68 . since these are in excess of normal ranges , how high do they represent a problem with liver . of are there various upper ranges such as 45-100 = mild fatty liver etc . a am also insulin resistant have pcs and may be are diabetic . all the signs of fatty liver disease .",1,28200,"hi, i had gone through your question and understand your concerns. firstly, i must stress that one or a few of the liver function tests should not be interpreted in isolation. the entire hepatic function panel should be ideally be available along with the normal laboratory reference ranges for a meaningful interpretation. you have provided only the ast and alt values. therefore, i can only answer in general terms. serum aminotransferases: are of two types.- alpine aminotransferase (alt) and- aspartame aminotransferase (ast). elevations of these are the two of the most useful indicators of liver cell injury. the ast is less live specific than the alt. elevations of the ast level may also be seen in acute muscle injury, (cardiac or skeletal muscle). mild degrees of alt level elevation may occasionally be seen in skeletal muscle injury or even after vigorous physical exercise. disproportionate elevations of the ast and alt levels when compared with the alkaline phosphatase level arise in diseases that primarily affect hepatocytes (ex; viral hepatitis). the ast/alt ratio is not very useful in determining the cause of liver injury, except in acute alcoholic hepatitis, wherein, the ratio is usually > 2 and the ast level is 400 iu/ml or lower. common causes of mild increases in ast and alt levels is fatty liver disease seen most often in the context of obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and alcohol abuse. the ratio of ast to alt may give additional clues as to the cause:- in chronic liver disease with early cirrhosis alt > ast,- in chronic liver disease with established cirrhosis ast > alt. extremes of the ratio of ast:alt may also be sometimes useful:- ratio >2 suggests alcoholic hepatitis, and-do not worry. it will take around 6 months for the enzymes to be normal again. hope this answers your question. if you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. i will be happy to answer your questions. wishing your daughters good health."

"a did a lot of excessive moving and cleaning my house for two days , a now have a lot of pain in lower back area , which a think is muscle spasm , a have had pain for 5 days now , kept me up late nights for 2 nights , what can a take or do to get rid of pain in lower back extending to both sides of my hips . thank you",1,26361,"dear-thanks for using chat doctor, i will be glad to give you my medical advice. back pain is a very frequent problem for which we need to do a basic evaluation. you did not mention that you had had mri of the back which gives a lot of information in terms of the vertebra, spinal stenosis and bulging disc. you might have a herniated disc pressing the nerve and giving you this pain. kidney pain is more in the costal area or the side of the back and will improve after antibiotics. however, you need a kidney ultrasound to evaluate for kidney stone or cysts. those can get infected and be painful. i hope that my advice has helped you. chat doctor."

"hi good morning i have pains in my left side of my lower belly went to my doctor who sent me for an ultra sound which shows i have 15 + follicles , is that cancerous and is it curable . when he said i may not have kids not a problem i have 4 lovely daughters and i tie my tubes date 14-08-2000 where it was cut and laser burn it is call [ btl ] for short here in trinidad and tobago please help",1,35681,"hi!, welcome to chat doctor forum, according to your history, it seems that you have plasma, since you quoted that you are not on oral contraceptive pills, and you have not had any issues either. these questions you would have faced by many doctors. it is true that such pigmentation is often seen after pregnancy or one who is on ocs. but we have been seeing such pigmentation on those who have not had such a history either. so, even if you never had a baby, one can have such pigmentation problem, just because of slight shift in the hormones in the body. it is the estrogen level in the blood which is more responsible for such pigmentation. if this is plasma, we are dealing with a very chronic problem. it can wax and vain also. sunlight & stress also has a big role to play. the best advise here would be to use a triple combination cream to begin with, and then gradually taper it off.don't use it for more than 2 weeks. as you taper it gradually starts using hy chat doctor. along with this also start using comic acid & it c based creams in day and evening. but please don't forget to use a good spf sunscreen daily thrice. sunscreen is mandatory. you can even undergo chemical peeling from an experienced dermatologist. results of this all might vary from patient to patient. now being a laser expert i've myself done the number of cases with lasers too. the best of the laser for this is q-switched nd:yag laser. but one cannot guarantee you any great results with this either. the results are variable here too. and its costly also. plasma has always been a very frustrating problem both for the patient and the treating doctor. it is one thing which can destroy the reputation of most reputed doctor. so, have patience and kindly consult a dermatologist for this. please do not take any beauty parlor treatment for this. this is one possibility what came in my mind. secondly it might be freckles too since you said you have spots all over your face. lasers is best for treating freckles. you may require only one sitting for this. kindly consult an experienced dermatologist who can diagnose and treat your problem. i hope this answers your query, if you any further questions, kindly write back to us. regards,"

"my girlfriend and i are trying to conceive through home pregnancy , our donor lives around 20 miles away , we go and collect the sperm and bring it home to inseminate it . can you give us any advice on the survival of the sperm or any tips to ensure it is inseminated correctly ?",2,111986,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. in normal healthy couples, it can sometimes even take up to a year to conceive. 80% of couples will conceive within one year if having regular unprotected intercourse (at least 2 to 3 days per week). it is best not to time the efforts of intercourse around ovulation unless you have accurately documented the ovulation date, with an ovulation predictor kit or with hormone levels checked at the doctor's office. the best way to try to conceive in the beginning is to have sex every other day from the time your period finishes until you start to feel premenstrual symptoms. premenstrual symptoms are caused by the same hormones as produced by pregnancy, so when you start to feel bloating, breast tenderness, nausea, or other pregnancy symptoms you do not need to continue to try to conceive that cycle, as you either already ovulated or are already pregnant. there are nearly 6 million sperm in every ejaculate from a man, so as long as some sperm is ejaculated inside the vagina, there is a possibility of conceiving. many women have sperm leak out after intercourse, however the ability of sperm to swim within the vagina ensures that a man with a normal sperm count has at least thousands of sperm that reach the egg if ovulation has been taking place. so in summary, many couples do not conceive within two months of beginning to try. i encourage you and your husband to have patience. in the meantime, the best way to prepare for healthy pregnancy is to get adequate rest, eat a healthy diet, avoid alcohol consumption, and take a prenatal vitamin or folic acid supplement which can help prevent birth defects. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"cum around wisdom tooth is tender , the tooth is partially out and has enough space to come out completely . is my sore throat and runny nose likely to be due to my wisdom tooth , and if so , is it likely to be impacted or just coming out ( pm 21 and all my other 3 wisdom teeth are out , despite taking ages for each one )",1,5711,hi. thanks for the query as per your complaint sore throat can be seen associated with wisdom tooth related infection and inflammation as the area of wisdom teeth is very close to throat and inflammation from wisdom tooth can even make the throat sore and painful. but runny nose is not commonly seen with sore throat if it is related to wisdom tooth and can be due to other causes like sinus infection or upper respiratory infection. so for this you can consult a physician and get evaluated. for tender gum around wisdom tooth that seems to be due to peritonitis which is inflammation of gum flap due to food accumulation and infection between gum flap and tooth. whether tooth is impacted or not can be ruled out with x-ray. for this consult an oral physician and get evaluated and an x-ray of the tooth will be done.first to reduce infection the area will be irrigated with antiseptic solution followed by a course of antibiotics like augmenting and anti-inflammatory painkillers like ibuprofen. warm saline gargle will also help. once the inflammation reduce then if the wisdom tooth is not impacted then it will be left to erupt. in case if the tenderness recurs then the gum flap will be removed to prevent recurrence. if the tooth is impacted then extraction is the best line of treatment. hope this helps. regards.

a have an question regarding my diabetes . am 27 year old and i just got my test done like 20 days ago . haemoglobin air was 5.7 % and mean plasma glucose was 126 mg/dl . my primary physician said that i have increased risk of diabetes . i was looking online they are saying that sugar level should be 70 to 130mg/dl before meal and less than 180mg/dl after meal . i just wan a tell you that day ate breakfast in the morning . so it means my glucose is under 180mg/dl . am kinda confused.please help me . i think i done have any risk . i did not tell my doctor that i ate that morning .,1,70463,"hello have gone through your question and understood your concern. fasting blood sugar (fbs) measures blood glucose after you have not eaten for at least 8 hours. it is the first test done to check for prediabetes and diabetes. if you were not fasting, then the result can not be taken in consideration for the diagnosis of pre-diabetes or diabetes. in my opinion, this result can be considerate like a random blood sugar (rbs) and measures blood glucose regardless of when you last ate. random testing is useful because glucose levels in healthy people do not vary widely throughout the day and blood glucose levels that vary widely may mean a problem. this test is also called a casual blood glucose test. it is true that your age, positive family history and being african american are risc factors for diabetes. but the test result can not be taken in consideration for the diagnosis because it is not fasting. a fasting blood sugar level from 100 to 125 mg/dl is considered prediabetes. if its 126 mg/dl or higher or a random blood sugar level of 200 mg/dl or higher ; on two separate tests, you have diabetes.(actually, if you were fasting, 129 mg/dl can be suggestive of diabetes not prediabetes and the next step will be to repeat the test for the confirmation of the diagnosis)in my opinion you don't have reason to be concerned because the test result is not a fasting but a random measurement, and we can not reach the diagnosis only with this test. so, be patient because the true fasting test will give the exact information about your situation. hope this is helpful. if you have other debts, feel free and ask. best regards."

my husband when he lays down gets a lot of pain in all his joints such as ankles knees back fingers and toes and when he pops them it relieves the pain for awhile then builds back up again after a few hours but all seems to go away when he is upright is has been going on for many years and has gotten to the point where he has to take a pain pill to sleep,1,33169,hi there. it seems like your husband has aggravated an underlying disc problem which he might have been having for some time. sudden exercises can aggravate such problems if somebody is not used to it. for a patient having an acute pain i would initially recommend a period of bed rest for 3-4 days until the pain subsides. he can sleep with his hips and knees flexed that will reduce a bit of pressure on the nerve roots that are getting compressed. he can take diclofenac 100 mg to add to the initial pain relief and apply some topical analgesic ointments or sprays. during the period he can walk to the bathroom and walk around as tolerated. he would need to avoid sitting for a long time if possible. then once the pain subsides he can get back to his normal day-to-day activities. then he should build up his back muscle strength by doing extension exercises. and if he is on the heavier side he should do a bit of dieting and exercises that for losing weight that will help him in the long run. any exercise regime should be started with gradual increments in the repeats. ellipse is a demanding machine and one needs to increase their training gradually. thank you.

"yes my name is dianne , having problems with my blood pressure , going very high but when a take medication it goes down . get this burning sensation in my lower back then it moves to my shoulders and arms and sometimes across my chest , when that happens it sends up my blood pressure . also pain and cramps in my both hands and arms , sometimes it wakes me up from sleep , also get light headed and blurry eyes . do not have the money to pay at this time .",1,53315,"good afternoon. i can certainly tell that you are not the nervous type if you are willing to write your question out and submit it the way you have. that takes a bit of courage. there are a couple of things to come to my mind when you describe your situation. one is called orthostatic hypotension or also orthostatic tremors. this condition is one where a person can start shaking in their hands and their knees and their arms and their legs after they have been up on their feet for a few seconds or a few minutes. usually, when this starts to happen, and they sit down the shaking goes away. the other thing is called benign essential tremor or benign essential familial tremor if the condition runs in one of your family members. however, in this case i would go preferentially with the first one since it seems as if your trimmers get worse when you are standing and writing something.at any rate, you should see a doctor who can take your blood pressure is in different positions such as lying, sitting, and standing and make a determination whether not you may have such an entity. would you please rate this answer with a star rating if it meets your approval for what you were looking for. and good luck to you in school."

my alt is 62 and a have been drinking one shot of vodka every day . a have a fatty liver according to the sonogram . a take no medication . the alt level was in the teens before a started taking soda . a stopped all alcohol . should a expect the alt to go down ?,1,28200,"hi, i had gone through your question and understand your concerns. firstly, i must stress that one or a few of the liver function tests should not be interpreted in isolation. the entire hepatic function panel should be ideally be available along with the normal laboratory reference ranges for a meaningful interpretation. you have provided only the ast and alt values. therefore, i can only answer in general terms. serum aminotransferases: are of two types.- alpine aminotransferase (alt) and- aspartame aminotransferase (ast). elevations of these are the two of the most useful indicators of liver cell injury. the ast is less live specific than the alt. elevations of the ast level may also be seen in acute muscle injury, (cardiac or skeletal muscle). mild degrees of alt level elevation may occasionally be seen in skeletal muscle injury or even after vigorous physical exercise. disproportionate elevations of the ast and alt levels when compared with the alkaline phosphatase level arise in diseases that primarily affect hepatocytes (ex; viral hepatitis). the ast/alt ratio is not very useful in determining the cause of liver injury, except in acute alcoholic hepatitis, wherein, the ratio is usually > 2 and the ast level is 400 iu/ml or lower. common causes of mild increases in ast and alt levels is fatty liver disease seen most often in the context of obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and alcohol abuse. the ratio of ast to alt may give additional clues as to the cause:- in chronic liver disease with early cirrhosis alt > ast,- in chronic liver disease with established cirrhosis ast > alt. extremes of the ratio of ast:alt may also be sometimes useful:- ratio >2 suggests alcoholic hepatitis, and-do not worry. it will take around 6 months for the enzymes to be normal again. hope this answers your question. if you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. i will be happy to answer your questions. wishing your daughters good health."

a have missed 2 pills this month not in a row one last week ( in the first week of a new pack ) and one this week the day before yesterday ( in the second week of the pack ) have had unprotected sex a few times with my husband and am feeling really nauseous today and have had a little spotting and am just wondering what the percentage is of getting pregnant when you miss 2 pills like that ? a know i have to wait until my regular period to be sure so i can test . also i took 2 pills yesterday when i remember could that be why i am nauseous ? thanks,1,41273,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. if you already missed three pills in a row in this pack of pills, you already have been at risk for pregnancy since you may have ovulated this month. you can finish the pack you are taking, but i would use a backup method of birth control for the protection during the rest of the pack. after your placebo week finishes, if you are not pregnant, you should just start a new pack of pills on time and if you don't miss any, your contraceptive will be effective after the first week of the new pack. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

well a have a one year old child her two front teetchatdoctore in about a 2 months ago . but a have a concern about one of her tooth on the top its kind of yellow with dark small little lines . that could that be a sign ? the has milk protein allergy . she stills breastfeed no bottles or pacifiers,1,78347,"hello, i can understand your concern and think of two possibilities for the grayish line you have described on the front teeth. firstly, if you took iron supplements during pregnancy or after childbirth, it may have entered the children bloodstream in uterus or through breast milk. the front teeth are developing in the uterus and matures in bone during initial months after birth, which may cause development of such lines. however, if this was the case, the line should have been present when the tooth erupted into oral cavity. as she has history of falling, it is quite a possibility that she may have damaged her front teeth. the teeth may not break or crack, but the pulp inside the tooth may have died making the tooth appear dark. invariably, this pulp would be infected and should be treated as the tooth is going to stay in oral cavity till your daughter ages 8-9 years. if this is the case, then she might need to go for lumpectomy procedure for the affected teeth. one more possibility is presence of plaque on the teeth due to inadequate oral hygiene and lack of proper tooth brushing. this can be removed by ultrasonic scaling procedure performed by the dentist in any case, i would recommend you to visit a dentist for examination of the line as confirmed diagnosis can be made only after physically looking at the teeth and the line you have described. if it is developmental, then no treatment is needed, and it will be gone with the milk tooth shedding. in case of any other reason, treatment will be required as described. i hope this information helps you. thank you for choosing chat doctor. take care. best,"
well a have a one year old child her two front teetchatdoctore in about a 2 months ago . but a have a concern about one of her tooth on the top its kind of yellow with dark small little lines . that could that be a sign ? the has milk protein allergy . she stills breastfeed no bottles or pacifiers,2,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

hi i a an asthmatic patient and have used lips 6 black ultra to loose weight and haven faced any problem .. but since i have been travelling up hills and have had flue a lot times i have blocked airways spasm ... due to which i have had breathing problems .. to a suggest me to continue lips 6 as i have been using singular and clinic for treatment of asthma,1,15554,"! i have read your question carefully, and must say that it is very well written. from what you wrote and from my clinical experience, i can say that you have symptoms of lethargy, depression, breathing problems (most probably due to anxiety), visual problems. you used to be anemic but now fine. now, according to me - you have two sets of problems ---1. psychological and 2. organic. the psychological or psychiatric illness looks like combination of anxiety and depression. you have been on desvenalafaxine (prestige) but looking at your symptom profile, i must say that it is not working at all. had i been treating you, i would have gone for some other chat doctor. ...there are many better and effective choices available, which also donor carry any major side effect. second problem is organic / physical problem. it looks like that you have postural hypotension, as you feel almost black out, dizziness occasionally, and weak. every time you get up, you take few minutes to gain some balance. you need to get some test done like-blood pressure reading both sitting and lying down position, thyroid, hemoglobin. they would check the cause behind this symptom. your breathing difficulty and heart aches is actually due to psychiatric problems, as your doctor says. i can understand that you really problem in breathing and you feel choked, but it has a psychological basis rather than physical one. such breathing problems are frequently seen in such patients in our clinic. with proper medicine this will certainly go away. ### you could not proceed with medication as it needs a silent state of mind, and it is not concentrating on something.....meditation is relaxing....when you have so many issues, you have breathing difficulty, etc., how can you relax? this result in strained meditation and there is headache....ok, so first get better with"

"of me and my boyfriend had sex 2 weeks ago and afterwards the condom slipped off inside me . when i went to pull it out it seemed like all the semen was still in there . but the next day we got the morning after pill and everything seemed fine . now 2 weeks later i started spotting which alternated between being heavy and light bleeding , it lasted about 3-4 days . and now my breast are tender to the touch and in starting to feel a little nauseated . is there a way i could possible a pregnant ?",1,8772,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the proper way to use the nearing is to put it in, leave it in for 3 weeks, take it out, wait one week, and replace it. during the week you are not wearing the ring, you should have some bleeding that is considered a menstrual cycle. if you wore the ring continuously for two months and then had a new one replaced but only removed it 3 days later, the pinkish spotting was your ""period"", which is caused by not wearing the ring. the bleeding was very light because you had suppressed it by continuously wearing the ring for over 2 months. so you should expect your next period about 4-5 weeks after the episode of spotting that you had. if you do not have menses by then, i recommend repeating the pregnancy test at that time. if you did not have regular monthly cycles before you used the ring, your cycle will follow your regular pattern that you typically have when not using hormonal contraception. if you are trying to get pregnant, you should have intercourse about every other day and begin taking prenatal vitamins as it benefits the health of the baby for the vitamins to be present at conception. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"
