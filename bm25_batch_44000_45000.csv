(if not allergic to) for 5 days, antigen plus 1 castle twice a day for 1 month, then 1 capsule daily for 2 months. if it is not relieved i would refer to an orthopedist for further management. with respect to your other medical conditions like diabetes, high cholesterol and blood pressure, there is a high risk of heart disease in the future. this risk can be greatly reduced by keeping the blood pressure below 130/85, any time blood glucose less than 140 mg/dl, and ldl under 70 mg/dl. work with your primary care doctor to achieve these. please let me know if you have further questions before meeting your primary care doctor."

"a was told by my nero-surgeon that they found spinal fluid in my spinal cord , but that he don to think there a any need for concern , a be also been diagnosed with cervical arthritis , bone spurs and have numbness , atrophy , and pain in my left arm from the arm pit down to my fingertips .",1,68582,"hi, i am chat doctor. i have read your message. i think i can help you. however, you have not told me the clinical details/symptoms. and any report has to be judged as per the symptoms. the report suggests that you have a disc problem that is compressing the nerves that comes out of your spine and supplies the nerve signals to your arm, and a bit of your forearm. the brain sends signals to the body e.g. arm to do some work. this is carried by spinal cord to the area, from where nerves come out and go to the specific area. mother nature has provided bones like skull and vertebral column to protect the brain and spinal cord (respectively). to allow our backs to bend, soft bags called discs are present between bones. sometimes these discs come out of their allotted space and compress the nerves that come out of the spinal cord and cause the symptoms. the symptoms that you should be having include-neck pain, arm pain more on left side, sensory symptoms like tingling and numbness on the left arm, wasting/thinning of the muscles on one side compared to the other side, reduced reflexes in arm- a doctor will need to test these for you. these symptoms may be present in any combination, and all the symptoms need not be present. however, sometimes, people do have atypical symptoms that i cannot predict. so if you do not have the above symptoms, you need to tell me exactly what your symptoms are and i may be able to tell you if the report is significant in your case. if however the symptoms are present, the report is very relevant, and i have already told you what it means. so you need to meet a spine surgeon (if you have the symptom combinations) and plan further medication (and/or surgery at a later date-if needed). i have tried to make it as simple as possible. i hope that the information helps you find the best solution for your problem. feel free to contact me further for a related issue. best of luck."

"i , may a answer your health queries right now ? please type your query here ... i today just few hour before a find some problem in my 11 month old son a penis some after urine there was some white discharge when a was applying johnson power . please suggest",2,97281,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. many women accidentally ingest medications or alcohol before they find out that they are pregnant. however, there is no fetus that even develops before the 7th week or so, so the effects of medications on a developing fetus would not yet be able to pose any harm to the pregnancy. furthermore, there are only a few, very strong iv antibiotics that can actually cause significant harm to a developing fetus. so it is unlikely that the antibiotic that your wife was taking was even unsafe during pregnancy. asking whether a woman is pregnant when prescribing medication is a common routine practice and does not mean that the medication prescribed is in any way. so in summary, i do not think you need to be worried about the medication your wife took in this very early stage. to enhance the health of her pregnancy, she should follow a well-balanced diet, avoid alcohol, and begin to take a vitamin supplement designed for pregnant women. your should also choose a prenatal care provider for her and have your first visit about a month from now. i hope i was able to adequate;y answer your question today, and that my advice was reassuring. best wishes,"

(search asthma diary template in google images)4. avoid triggers like smoke, agarbattis, cockroaches, perfumes, face powder, and wash bedsheets, curtains regularly. do wet mopping and not sweeping especially if your child is around. clean ac filters once a week. she will most likely outgrow this once she is about 7 to 10 years of age (unless there is a strong family history of wheeze/asthma), so lifelong medications will not be needed. we have seen many child"

"i my period is due in 3 days . be and my husband are trying for a kid , for the past 7 months but with no luck . this month also we had regular sex every other day . yesterday soon after intercourse a had a slight bleeding or rather spotting ( it could be some 13 or 14 days past ovulation now , not sure ) . is there anything to worry about .",1,74613,"hallow dear, if you recall about the fertility period, it is about 10 days around the day of ovulation and the day of ovulation is 14 days before next expected menses. your cycles are of 32 days. hence day 18 would be the day of ovulation. you had unprotected intercourse on that day; so that intercourse is most likely to be responsible for this pregnancy. moreover, the other unprotected intercourse you had with someone else was just 3 days before the expected menses. it is most unlikely to have the egg still alive till that day since the egg has life of only 24 hours. so, in my opinion, the person with whom you had sex on day 18 should be the father of this child. still, if you want confirmation, may be for legal purpose, you may opt for dna test. i hope this helps you."

a have a 5 year old daughter who has been having chronic stomach pain for the last two years . they come and go . usually in the middle of the night . they last for an hour or so . the throws up and then she is fine . one all the test and eliminated suspected food . nothing has helped . any suggestions ?,1,15522,"hello, welcome to chat doctor. thanks for posting your question at this forum. we understand your concern. i am chat doctor psychiatry from india. i will guide you about your daughters' health. whatever information you have given here about your daughter, point towards a serious long-lasting mental illness of psychosis like schizophrenia. i must explain you in simpler way. schizophrenia is a psychotic illness in which the person has abnormal perception, absurd thinking, decline of higher mental function, deterioration in social and occupational functioning and significant personal sufferings for years. the patient may claim to hear unusual voices which others deny hearing. this is called auditory hallucination. initially the voices come for a short period and the person feels strange and does not understand what to do. he/ she gradually may start believing on those voices as frequency and intensity of voices increases with passage of time. often these voices comment/discuss derogatory about the person and sometimes these may suggest or command the person to do certain act. sometimes the person may harm herself/ himself sunder the influence of these voices. as you have experienced, she has a self-talking behavior since last many years, has harmed herself once and now she is claiming a clear two-way conversation with that voice. it appears that she is having auditory hallucination(auditory hallucination is one of the commonest symptoms in psychosis like schizophrenia), and apparently these voices are unpleasant or commanding in nature that might have provoked the episode of self harm in the past. since the onset of symptoms is in childhood and has been continuing for years it shows poor awareness of caregiver about the symptoms of illness. it is never too late. you must consult a good child and adolescent psychiatrist and encourage your daughter to discuss her symptoms honestly so that the diagnosis can be finalized. if i had been her doctor, i would have advice her for brain imaging, certain other investigations, to take some antipsychotic medicines under supervision of a family member and to attend psycho-educative classes regularly. medicines and supportive therapy can bring remission to illness. hope this has helped you. i wish you all the best."

(you would need to have a mucus producing cough for 3 myths out of each of the last 2 yrs). symptoms may include productive cough, breathlessness and wheezing. it is diagnosed based on history of smoke exposure and symptoms, physical examination. blood test and imaging studies will need to be done if it is suspected by your doctor. copd is not normally seen in young persons there are other causes of shortness of breath and your doctor will check for these. they include: anemia, asthma, lung infections, heart disease, inflammation of the lung, blockage of the upper airway such as the nose. you need to see you doctor to determine the cause of your symptoms i hope this information is helpful to you"

"a have back pain in my lower left side , came on suddenly on the tennis court . a thought it was a muscle but advil did nothing for it home one said it could be my kidneys . of its a strain , a all rest , if it a my kidneys a should see a doctor . now can a tell for sure what it is ?",1,67355,"hi, thanks for writing in. please find my observations below.1. the kidneys are well protected organs in the abdomen. it is first protected by a strong capsule and then surrounded with fat. then there is bowel in front of it and from all sides there is the muscle in abdominal wall protecting the kidney from trauma.2. from the above, it is less likely that the pain is from any kidney internal bleeding if you have no other urinary symptoms of trauma to kidneys like passage of dark urine.3. since if is on the left side of the body, thought must also be given to the spleen and if the pain is severe then you immediately require an ultrasound examination to make sure you do not have any splenic injury resulting from the trauma incident.4. please take rest for about an hour and if it is still paining severely then visit the er and get yourself evaluated for any internal injury probably involving spleen."

"hello by name is ebony and a a 21 years old . for the past months or so a have been having really bad chest pains ; as if someone is stepping on my chest with a boot on . by heart has irregular beats , one minute it a beating fast next minute it a so slow a can feel it like it a about to stop any minute ; times it feels like my back has sharp needles in it and a can to move ; a be been to the hospital plenty of times my ekg is different overtime but yet they don to know what a wrong . a a very scared for my life . help please .",1,25338,"hello and thank you for using chat doctor. i carefully read your question and understand your concern. but you should not worry, its nothing serious. as you describe, my opinion is that it might be a rhythm issue. someone can feel strong and fast heart beats for different reasons. it may be a simple sinus tachycardia. this means that the heart is beating faster than 100 beats for minute. its normal range in a resting condition is between 60-100 beats for minute. when it goes up you may feel a strong heart beat in your chest and a sensation like your body is beating too. another reason for this sensation might be what we call an ekstrasystol.these is electrical heart impulses that generates in some parts of heart different from normal sinus rhythm. this generates an escaped beat that the person feels like jumping ore bumping. it gives the sensation like a beat is skipping, may experience palpitations or an anxiety sensation that your daughter explains like trembling. this extrasistoles may happen from different reasons from simple emotional stress to other pathologies like anemia, hyperthyroidism etc. so, my opinion as cardiologist is that you have nothing to worry. it is just a simple episode, and it is quite normal in younger ages. only if these symptoms persist and begins to interfere the daily live, if i was your treating doctor i will recommend some examinations like a blood analysis to exclude anemia, the thyroid hormones, an electrocardiogram, echocardiography and of course a holder monitoring. this will help us to document and see what happens with heart rhythm. at meantime, i will recommend your daughter to avoid coffee, caffeine products because they rise heart frequency and extrasistolic beats. i encourage her to have physical training because sometimes it helps in reducing extrasistoles, tachycardia, even making them disappear. wish i was helpful. take good care. best regards"

"i doctor , by mon is suffering from cardiac problem . the referred doctors are saying that there more than 3 blocks hence she has to undergo bypass operations . would like to know is there any treatment without operation to recover from this problem . the is almost 68 yrs old lady . could a reply",1,45742,"hi and welcome to chat doctor. i hope you didn't annoy the lady nephrologist by ad chat doctor. how old is your mum? what other medical problems does she have? what is the exact size of the kidneys on the usg scan? what does the urine tests show? what is important to establish is whether the kidney impairment has happened over past few days or months to years. i suspect your nephrologist has made that assessment and labelled her ckd (means kidney problem slowly deteriorating over may months or years). if her kidney problem is recent and there are active urinary sediments and urine protein, i would do a kidney biopsy (as long as kidneys are more than 8 cmd) to clarify the diagnosis and guide treatment. i have not studied other forms of medicine, so can't comment about them or the benefits of them. i certainly see a lot of people who have come to harm from alternate medications, once again there is bias here since i donor get to see anyone who might have improved. if your mother has less than 8cm kidneys +/- no proteinuria/ blood in urine, unlikely she will recover with any treatment. once again without assessing your mother personally and ensuring that there is no reversible problem i cannot confidentially say this."

yes please i have a 6 year old with asthma who coughs all the time at night its so bad they send her home from school . a have taken her to doctors hospitals one doctor said acid reflux but today i went to or they said they didst see any signs of acid reflux .. something is going on when you cough 22 hours out of 24 hours i just done understand you know anything that might help ? ? or even what it might be ? an asthma be the cause for this cough to be this bad and it has been going on for 2 weeks,1,34552,"the only thing for a cold sensation i can think of is acid reflux. when you get heart burn it feels crazy and can give anxiety (hence the rapid heart rate). you can remedy acid reflux (herd, or heart burn, throat burn or whatever you want to call it) by getting some digestive enzymes (try something like source naturals daily digestive enzymes) at a local vitamin store (or try vitacost.com) and till give her enough digestive juices to help grind up her food better. also, food intolerances will cause problems too. i discovered a food intolerance to wheat, milk and peanuts. but you have to write down how you feel after you eat something and try eliminating it for a while and see how it goes. you can ask a doctor for an elisa test (for food allergies) but it doesn't tell us much. a food elimination/rotation diet is much better plus it can't hurt. a sharp knife like feeling is definitely heart burn from what i've felt or heard about. make sure you write down when these things occur, what time and how long (dates) and what she had to eat earlier. pizza is a biggie on heart burn. hot dogs, anything with bad fats in it. bread if she is intolerant to wheat and so on. i would throw in a thyroid (tsh) test for hyper or hypothyroidism. so many symptoms stem from those diseases (difficulty breathing, rapid heart rate, digestion issues and so on)...that it should be warranted just to rule it out. and if it keeps happening see the doc. but sometimes i do believe we have to be our own detectives. my dd has a friend that was ill on and off for a couple of years and saw 11 doctors (hello, aren't they supposed to be intelligent beings?) but no, they couldn't figure out anything. finally, they figured out she has a gluten-allergy."

i a 35 years old .... i a trying to conceive and my doctor suggested me to take closed for 5 days and dophastan for 14 days from 13 day of cycle and yesterday was my cycles 14 day and i found 2 our 3 drops of bleeding ... is it normal ? is those medicine help me to get pregnant ?,1,52747,"hello, and i hope i can clarify this for you. you are absolutely correct in the fact that the length of your cycle is related to when you ovulate... and your ovulation date is 14 days back from when you got your period, rather than counting 14 days from the start of your period. it is typical for most women to have a 14-day luteal phase, as you suggested. you absolutely may ovulate later in your cycle. i do not know how long you and your partner have tried to conceive before trying closed. i would not recommend trying closed at all unless you have tried for a year (meaning unprotected sex at least 2-3 times per week) and not become pregnant. a reproductive endocrinologist is an appropriate referral if you have a history of infertility for one year, and if you fail at least 3 cycles of closed. they can prescribe closed and combine it with intrauterine insemination, which can increase the success rate. even though you may have had a child together before, there can be an issue with the male partner too, and it would be advisable he gets his sperm count evaluated. but you can still have conceived this cycle if you ovulated on the closed, and continued to have unprotected sex at least a week after your ovulation kit showed positive. your progesterone level pre-ovulation is not relevant at all. so- if you don't get a period by day 35 or so, do a pregnancy test. and if you didn't conceive this cycle, a reproductive endocrinologist might be a better choice to manage your closed. i hope this answered your question, and best of luck in getting pregnant. take care,"

(the amount of platelets in the bloodstream is reduced because the spleen is busy trapping them). so usually people with cirrhosis end up having a problem with portal hypertension and an enlarged spleen, and a reduced platelet count in the bloodstream. as time goes by, the liver may try to repair itself by growing new cells. if there is a lot of scar tissue already present the new cells grow between scar tissue (and result in abnormal nodules). the nodules and scar tissue further interfere with blood flow through the liver. so over time people with advanced cirrhosis can end up having a problem with more and more abnormal nodules and scar tissue forming which interferes even more with blood flow through the liver which makes the spleen continue to enlarge, and the platelet count continue to chat doctor. the splenomegaly is usually not reversible. please go for regular medical follow up. hope this helps"

"my daughter is 2 yrs old . yesterday she didst have much to eat . except when it came to junk food ( chips , juice etc ) this was mostly the entire day refusing to eat solid food . then today she projectile vomit ( 3times ) , reoccurring hiccups and still doesn't have an appetite . but doesn't show signs of being sick ... help !",1,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"a had balloon compression surgery for trigeminal surgery in october and ever since a have numbness in my mouth , gums and tongue on the right side . also in the upper and lower lips . by neurosurgeon says he was not near this area . a do have slight numbness in right cheek area as predicted .",2,44715,"hello, i can understand your concern. it would have been helpful if you had mentioned which tooth was treated for root canal. as you are mentioning that the tooth was black and had cracks in it, i am assuming that the tooth is in the lower front region, and you had had some trauma to the lower jaw area which made the tooth dead and also hurt the chin and lip. other possibility is that if the tooth was dead for many years, it may have developed a periapical cyst in relation with the tooth which might be pressing on the mental nerve supplying lower lip and chin and may cause numbness of those areas. alternatively, the numbness may have started after taking local anesthesia in the lower front area for some tooth problem and the injection might have been given deep. in any case, it seems that the nerve supplying sensation to the lower front area of jaw along with lower lip and chin (mental nerve) is damaged. usually, if the nerve is damaged, it can regenerate in 3-6 months and the sensations can return. if you are not sure regarding the crown on the tooth, you can avoid it for some months and take care not to bite hard things with that tooth so that it does not fracture. you can get the crown after the numbness is solved. i would also advise you to visit an oral and maxillofacial surgeon for the examination of the area and regarding numbness. he/she might take an x-ray to rule out presence of periapical lesion or cyst in relation with the tooth. crown should surely be postponed until this possibility is ruled out. i hope this information helps you. thank you for choosing chat doctor. i wish you feel better soon. best,"

hi sir my father is a diabetes and chronic depression patient for last 8 yrs . he is on regular medicines . from last 2 months his hands are shaking without reason . the doctor is telling its not due to any of the depression medicines and told to see a neurologist . can a ply suggest me it to do ?,1,23106,"hi, i am chat doctor. i have read your message. i think i can help you. the symptoms of the query are quite suggestive of a stroke. the sudden onset of the symptoms, the motor weakness, the swallowing and speaking difficulty, the shaking of hands. all symptoms are suggestive of the diagnosis of stroke. the fact that he had been having similar episodes over the last 3 months is suggestive of mini strokes that we call tia medically. these are usually warning signs of an impending stroke. i am unaware from the query about the duration of the symptoms. within 4 to 8 hours onset should be treated urgently and should be visiting an emr as soon as possible. he will need urgent treatment. if it is more than that, he needs to meet a neurologist who will probably perform a cat scan of the brain with or without the angiogram (depending on the protocol of the hospital). as per the report of the cat scan, medicines may be initiated. i think a low dose statin and antiplatelet should help. i would suggest a scan prior to the initiation of the medicines because the closest differential is a possible cerebral hemorrhage (less likely in view of the mini strokes) where these medicines are not to be given. meanwhile, i think you should start him on physiotherapy for the motor weakness. another chance i want to consider here is possible diabetes and hypoglycemia attacks. if the gp has thought about this as a possibility and tested sugars, there is probably nothing to worry about. otherwise, hypoglycemia in a diabetic patient would explain the brief episodes. and a hypoglycemia can also explain the prolonged symptoms. in such a case, sugars need to be well monitored. the third possibility i need to consider is a vasculitis. this is a common cause of stroke, but usually is thought of in young patients. the last 2 causes i have considered in the view of preexisting foot ulcers which cannot be explained by tia or current stroke as the ulcers predate the stroke. i think you need to get the scan and meet up with a neurologist. unfortunately, as explained, i cannot suggest medications without the scan. i have tried to make it as simple as possible. please feel free to contact me for any further clarification. best of luck,"

"a have had a pylori since 2003 , however they didst know what it was tell 2009 , i was called in for treatment right away once they found out what i had , it took them 7 year to find out that i had a pylori , because of that the winning of my stomach is damage permanently , and i have constant vomiting and stomach pains . i need to know if i can still get pregnant , i haven gotten pregnant since i got a pylori .",1,97433,"hi, after reviewing your question i assume you mean a positive breath test for h. pylori? i am sorry to hear the amount of discomfort that you've been through. this is how i would proceed to look at your case:1. your symptoms are very peculiar for peptic ulcer disease or gastritis. both are different ways of getting damage done to your stomach. an ulcer is like a crater which may or may not be prone to bleeding. gastritis is a bit like having multiple pinpoint sore spots, causing pain and discomfort. a positive breath test may mean that you have h. pylori infection. as uncomfortable as this is, it is usually very treatable. were you on many painkillers because of the spinal fusion? if yes, then they would certainly have contributed. 2. i don't think a mask has anything to do with this. a sterile nasogastric tube taken out of the bag is very unlikely to bring infection to the insides of the stomach. nasogastric tubes, however, do cause a bit of irritation in the stomach lining. while they could have a very small contribution, i doubt they have had a significant effect. 3. the problem at hand seems to be the h. pylori infection which is a bacterial infection of the stomach lining which causes wear and tear in the stomach. this bug is acquired by the orofacial route. what this means is that someone with h. pylori sheds the bacteria through their stools. sometimes, because of poor hand hygiene, they may pass it on to others, especially through food. the new victim ingests these bugs and in this way h. pylori finds a new home to infest. i don't think your husband having a breath test will add to anything if he does not have symptoms. 4. an unintentional weight loss may signify a gastric ulcer (in opposition to peptic ulcer)5. you may benefit from a look down into the stomach through gastrostomy. it will give a great deal of information. your weight loss is also an indication of getting you a ct scan of the abdomen to ensure that there is nothing dangerous in play. 6. treatment would include amoxicillin, azithromycin and an acid tablet such as omeprazole for a 10 to 14-day course. since these recommendations include a gastrostomy, you will eventually have to visit a physician or a gastroenterologist to have it done. gastroenterologists are also excellent at managing h. pylori infections, along with ulcers and gastritis."

"i have just started taking florid as i have pcos and my partner and i would like a baby . the doctors have prescribed me a 5 day course of closed , today was my 12th day and gone for follicular monitoring , is it possible to get pregnant with this closed ?",1,52747,"hello, and i hope i can clarify this for you. you are absolutely correct in the fact that the length of your cycle is related to when you ovulate... and your ovulation date is 14 days back from when you got your period, rather than counting 14 days from the start of your period. it is typical for most women to have a 14-day luteal phase, as you suggested. you absolutely may ovulate later in your cycle. i do not know how long you and your partner have tried to conceive before trying closed. i would not recommend trying closed at all unless you have tried for a year (meaning unprotected sex at least 2-3 times per week) and not become pregnant. a reproductive endocrinologist is an appropriate referral if you have a history of infertility for one year, and if you fail at least 3 cycles of closed. they can prescribe closed and combine it with intrauterine insemination, which can increase the success rate. even though you may have had a child together before, there can be an issue with the male partner too, and it would be advisable he gets his sperm count evaluated. but you can still have conceived this cycle if you ovulated on the closed, and continued to have unprotected sex at least a week after your ovulation kit showed positive. your progesterone level pre-ovulation is not relevant at all. so- if you don't get a period by day 35 or so, do a pregnancy test. and if you didn't conceive this cycle, a reproductive endocrinologist might be a better choice to manage your closed. i hope this answered your question, and best of luck in getting pregnant. take care,"

"a have a 4 year old daughter who grabs herself . her primary care talked about looser underwear , no pants after her bath , good wiping habits . a a have been doing this now for several months . the is now crying everyday about the tickle that she feels and she wants it to stop . is there a deeper problem ?",3,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"hello . i think my wisdom teeth are acting up . i have an important exam to take on saturday , and do not have time between now and then to go to the dentist . is there anything i can take in the meantime to alleviate the pain , and make sure i done get distracted by it between now and saturday -- and especially saturday ? thanks",1,6132,"hi. thanks for the query. as you have gaps between all your teeth, and also you have overbite that is indication of an indication that you need braces to close the gap and also to correct your bite. so my suggestion is to consult an orthodontist and get a clinical examination done followed by appropriate x-rays and impressions of your teeth to make casts to plan your treatment. fixed orthodontic braces will help in appropriate alignment of teeth. as you also have inflammation of the gum flap over the wisdom tooth, so my advice to you is to first get the wisdom tooth removed and once the extraction site heals proceed with the orthodontic treatment. for now do warm saline gargles and antiseptic mouthwash gargles. take anti-inflammatory painkillers like ibuprofen to reduce pain in the gum. hope this helps. regards. chat doctor."
"hello . i think my wisdom teeth are acting up . i have an important exam to take on saturday , and do not have time between now and then to go to the dentist . is there anything i can take in the meantime to alleviate the pain , and make sure i done get distracted by it between now and saturday -- and especially saturday ? thanks",2,22667,"dear patient, i can understand your concern and feel sorry for the pain you are suffering from. you are informing me that when you got the upper molar extracted, the dentist told you that the bone between the sinus and tooth is destroyed and sinus cavity is open. roots of upper molar often are found inside the maxillary sinus, which causes opening of the sinus cavity while extraction of the tooth, creating an oro-antral fistula, that is a direct connection between oral cavity and sinus cavity. in this case, the food or water you take has chances of passing infection in the sinus through mouth and the infection does not resolve. it is mandatory to close this connection between mouth and the sinus. it could be done by the dentist by taking stitches in the area when he found that sinus has opened, but it can also be done now. however, as about 2 weeks has passed since extraction, the opening would not be as much clear as it would have been during extraction. a blood clot may have filled the area. so what you need to do now is, go to an oral surgeon or an ent specialist. i know you have insurance problem, but there seems no other solution to your problem. you might have to go for x-rays and probably ct scan of the area to diagnose if oro-antral fistula actually exists and if it does, you might have to go for a little surgery to close the communication between mouth and sinus followed by antibiotics to resolve the infection. i hope this information helps. thank you for choosing chat doctor. i wish you get well soon. best,"

"i have been trying to conceive for the past 6months by its failing i am failing , have been prescribed proverb tablets and omit for 5days , , , ,am i going to get pregnant .. i am 28years old , and 1.7m in height , i have a four year old son , and have never been diagnosed of any disease , have been using the family planning tablets for the past 2years",1,76346,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. fertomid is a type of fertility medication used help to cause ovulation in women who have trouble getting pregnant. because you did get pregnant (even though you had a miscarriage), unless you have been trying since then for over a year and been unable to conceive, the fatimid medication will not likely increase your chance of pregnancy significantly. therefore, even if you forgot to take some pills, you still have a significant chance of pregnancy as you are still very young, especially if you have regular menstrual cycles. if you and your husband have not been trying to conceive for more than a year on your own, i would not recommend using any fertility medication. using fatimid for more than four menstrual cycles can actually reduce your risk of pregnancy, as it decreases the effect of estrogen on your uterine lining. 80% of healthy couples will conceive within one year if they are having regular (at least 2 to 3 days per week) intercourse without contraception. one in 10 pregnancies will end in miscarriage, which means that 90% of the time couples will conceive a perfectly healthy pregnancy after a miscarriage without any form of medical treatment. so in summary, missing the fatimid tablets this particular month will not likely affect your chance of conceiving this cycle if you already ovulate naturally. i strongly recommend trying to get pregnant naturally for one year before using any type of fertility medication, as your body has proven that you can conceive even though that pregnancy did not work out. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this additional information was helpful. best wishes,"

"a currently got off my birth control pill because of all the risks associated with it and a have been using it for many years now , and a am currently only using condoms with my partner . is this smart ? a do not want to use anything with artificial hormones anymore",2,27194,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. tri-sprintec is a birth control pill that has a traffic regimen; which means that each color pill in the package has a slightly different dose of hormones. occasionally, women who take traffic pills may have some spotting in the first few days after each pill strength changes over the course of the month. this may cause some slight bleeding or spotting when were not supposed to have your period. whenever you had vaginal bleeding, regardless of the cause, usually there is some cramping that accompanies it. furthermore, it is not unusual to have irregular bleeding or spotting in the first 3 months of pill use. both sprinter and tri-sprintec are considered low-dose birth control pills, however there are many brands on the market that have a lower dose of estrogen than the pill you are currently taking. so you may have less irregular bleeding and spotting on a different kind of monophasic (same dose all month) birth control pill. regarding pregnancy, the chance of your conceiving while taking birth control pills and using a condom is basically nonexistent. so i believe the symptoms you were experiencing are side effects due to the new birth control pill. if your desire is for lighter, regular periods, a different brand of monophasic pill may work better for you with fewer side effects. i hope i was able to adequately answer questions today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

hello . to a bought and used the over the counter yeast infection depository . about a week about . it started coming out over the next couple of days but then this chunky consistency has turned into a thick white discharge . a have all of a sudden started my period even thought a just had my last cycle two weeks ago . and its still coming out in the blood . a am not sure what it could be . a am no longer itching . but the blood is very clot chunky and grossing and starting to worry me . do what to do . also the period is not coming out on to the pad a a wearing . a can wipe and it a so much . but not leaking as normal,1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"by 5 year old son has been complaining of chest pains when he breathes deep breaths and a found a hard money lump on his left breast , when a touch it he does not complain that it hurts but it is obviously a lump . be has not been hurt in the chest area but the lump is worrisome , what could it be ?",1,74210,"hello! thank you for the query. yes, umbilical hernia can always be a reason of abdominal pain. however, it can be also asymptomatic. hernia is simply a hole in the abdominal wall. when the hole is small, but big enough to let intestine or momentum to get through, the contents of hernia gets squeezed and that is what hurts. so if in your belly button is a lump which hurts when you pres it, that can be the cause of your symptoms. if hernia is empty, it should not hurt at all. if it is about ascites, in most cases it does not hurt at all. the only way it can hurt, is when there is so much liquid inside your abdomen, that intestines gets squeezed, and it can lead to intestine blockage. but it would be easily visible, and your abdomen would become unnaturally big, like with big ball inside. hope this will answer your questions. regards"

"hi there .. i have been married 3.5 yrs and i have been trying to conceive since last 8 months .. i have my periods very regular , but i was getting this brown spotting every month before my proper periods started.my doctor has given me the primula a 2 tablets for 14 days from the 16th day of my periods.for three months . and she said that i should keep on trying to conceive.wanted confirm if one can conceive while having such medication and incas if one does . and continue having the medicine could it be dangerous",1,108096,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. it is true that theoretically you should have been clear of the injection within three months of discontinuation, however many women after being a depo-provera for a long time do not resume having ovulatory, regular, menstrual cycles until 6 to 9 months or even up to a year after discontinuation. unfortunately, it is difficult to artificially induce ovulation in women who are coming off depo-provera. if you were not trying to become pregnant, your cycle could be regulated temporarily with birth control pills, but if you're actually trying to get pregnant the best thing you can do with this point is to just keep trying and wait and see. if you feel any symptoms of pregnancy, and you haven't gotten your period for a while, i would do pregnancy test just to make sure. there is always a possibility even if your periods are not regular that you do ovulate sometimes. so in summary, continue having unprotected sex every other to every three days and give it some more time. 80% of couples will conceive within one year, and if after a year of trying you and your partner are unsuccessful, it might be a good idea to see a fertility specialist for an evaluation. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes, and good luck getting pregnant,"

a had a total hysterectomy 8 months ago the doctor made an incision across my lower abdomen . a have had intercourse 4 times since then because it is so painful a cant stand anything touching me in there . it burns and sting and a bleed afterwards . please help ...,1,5236,hormonal therapy is normally recommended for 5 years. one of the side effects of tamoxifen is uterine carcinoma which has happened in your case. in such cases tamoxifen is stopped and a total hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy is done at the earliest and tamoxifen restarted. it is not advisable either to stop tamoxifen for 4 months or to continue taking it in the presence of uterine cancer. so my advice to you would be to get the hysterectomy done at the earliest rather than waiting till october and then restart tamoxifen. all the references can be had from nccn.org

"i doctor , a have regular cycle but now i was delay in my menstrual cycle for last 8 days and this is the first time . a consulted doctor she advised me to take naturogest 200 my twice daily morning and evening . and i have undergone urine pregnancy test and got negative . to why this happens .",1,7012,"hello, and i hope i can help you todayunwanted 72, when taken correctly, reduces a women chance of pregnancy from an unprotected encounter to less than 10%. however, unfortunately that means that one in 10 women still can conceive even if they take the medication correctly. furthermore, in the cycle that she takes it the medication can delay or affect her cycle. so just to be safe, i would recommend that your girlfriend do a urine pregnancy test. it does not need to be done in the doctor's office you can purchase one over-the-counter. however, she did have a normal menstrual cycle since she took the unwanted, which is a good sign that she is not pregnant. women can have irregular menstrual cycles from hormonal changes due to stress, weight or schedule changes, and other medical hormonal problems. if her pregnancy test is negative, and your girlfriend is not menstruate for three months, she should see a gun doctor for an evaluation to figure out why. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"my nephew is in ghana , he was having a seizure with swollen lips and was very white , he was shaken on controllable had no temp , so what was going on with him he is 6yrs old he has no history of seizures i wonder what will tiger that episode plus get back to me am very worried about the kid . thanks lily",1,54222,"hello libya, the latest episode your son has had is suggestive of pain induced syncope. all the features described is fitting with a syncope including the brief unrolling of eyes and jerks and waking up quickly without much confusion. the earlier episode while he was playing the video game is more difficult to comment on as there were no eyewitnesses, and we are not exactly sure about the duration of the event.(how long he remained unconscious) even this episode could have been brought on by pain-the shoulder click. in seizures many a time the eeg & mri brain can be normal. the only worrying thing is the abnormality in the eeg. you could take a second opinion about the eeg to see if it's a significant abnormality. i say this because antiepileptic treatment is long term and hence we need to be reasonably sure about the diagnosis before medications are started. what is certain is that your son has tendency to lose consciousness when he encounters pain. he could lie down immediately in such circumstances or flex his legs close to the chest in a sitting position to avoid falls. i think you could wait on starting medications as the evidence is not overwhelming in favor of a seizure. discuss with your doctor regarding precautions you can take to avoid syncope other than the ones i have mentioned above. hope this helps!"

"i doc , yesternight what exactly happened was that a and by partner were naked and hugging each other and i had a pre-cum earlier at that time but didst proceed as our wish but now we both agent sure whether my penis touched her slit or not , even if it would have done then on the top or so side of the vulva [ we both are virgins ] . will see get pregnant ? are type your query here ...",1,79191,"hello and i hope i can help you today. chlamydia is the most common asymptomatic sexually-transmitted disease in young adults. the great majority of people who have chlamydia have no symptoms at all. normally, it is recommended that if you have a previous partner who is diagnosed with chlamydia that you undergo treatment because having the infection even without symptoms is so common. so your new girlfriend is probably right that you were the one who spread chlamydia to her. of course this is not your fault, as you did not know that you carry the infection. however, in order to cure both your current girlfriend and you is recommended that you both have treatment at the same time, so you cannot spread it back and forth to each other. even if you get tested, and it is negative, there are a significant number of false negative tests, so it is still recommended that you both be treated. your girlfriends' obstetrician, at least in the united states, is allowed to write you a prescription for the correct medication. i suggest you attend one of her prenatal appointments with her so that possibly you could both take the medication at that visit at the same time if they have it available. so in summary, most people, both men and women, have no symptoms when they have chlamydia. during pregnancy, it is routinely tested because chlamydia and a pregnant woman at delivery can cause eye infections in the baby. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

a my lower lip and chin became numb and a had a bad toothache . had root canal a a dentist said the tooth was dead and full of black unhealthy stuff . the tooth had 3 cracks in it . pm on antibiotics and now 2 days later still numbness . have to have crown now and am afraid to have one put on if still numb .,1,44715,"hello, i can understand your concern. it would have been helpful if you had mentioned which tooth was treated for root canal. as you are mentioning that the tooth was black and had cracks in it, i am assuming that the tooth is in the lower front region, and you had had some trauma to the lower jaw area which made the tooth dead and also hurt the chin and lip. other possibility is that if the tooth was dead for many years, it may have developed a periapical cyst in relation with the tooth which might be pressing on the mental nerve supplying lower lip and chin and may cause numbness of those areas. alternatively, the numbness may have started after taking local anesthesia in the lower front area for some tooth problem and the injection might have been given deep. in any case, it seems that the nerve supplying sensation to the lower front area of jaw along with lower lip and chin (mental nerve) is damaged. usually, if the nerve is damaged, it can regenerate in 3-6 months and the sensations can return. if you are not sure regarding the crown on the tooth, you can avoid it for some months and take care not to bite hard things with that tooth so that it does not fracture. you can get the crown after the numbness is solved. i would also advise you to visit an oral and maxillofacial surgeon for the examination of the area and regarding numbness. he/she might take an x-ray to rule out presence of periapical lesion or cyst in relation with the tooth. crown should surely be postponed until this possibility is ruled out. i hope this information helps you. thank you for choosing chat doctor. i wish you feel better soon. best,"

my brother in law wife was bite by their pet dog today morning . only the dogs teeth impression was found . no symptoms of blood wound . she is four month pregnant . when consulted to the gynaecologist she was not able to prescribe treatment for this . could a please advice,1,97281,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. many women accidentally ingest medications or alcohol before they find out that they are pregnant. however, there is no fetus that even develops before the 7th week or so, so the effects of medications on a developing fetus would not yet be able to pose any harm to the pregnancy. furthermore, there are only a few, very strong iv antibiotics that can actually cause significant harm to a developing fetus. so it is unlikely that the antibiotic that your wife was taking was even unsafe during pregnancy. asking whether a woman is pregnant when prescribing medication is a common routine practice and does not mean that the medication prescribed is in any way. so in summary, i do not think you need to be worried about the medication your wife took in this very early stage. to enhance the health of her pregnancy, she should follow a well-balanced diet, avoid alcohol, and begin to take a vitamin supplement designed for pregnant women. your should also choose a prenatal care provider for her and have your first visit about a month from now. i hope i was able to adequate;y answer your question today, and that my advice was reassuring. best wishes,"

"i in been experiencing some things a see as unusual , a am sexually active and on the contraceptive pill ava30ed but have been experiencing some irregularities with my menstrual cycle , during the week a was taking the placebo sugar pill a didst experience bleeding at all only a small amount of dark brown discharge , and now being the week after the placebo pill a am experiencing constant thick stringy black odourless discharge and a am not sure what this means",1,44777,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. low-dose oral contraceptives sometimes produce the side effect of what is called breakthrough bleeding... which means bleeding when you're not supposed to have your period. when blood travels very slowly through your genital tract, it mixes with your vaginal discharge and frequently turns brown or blackish. breakthrough bleeding is most common in either the first three months of pill use, or after being on the pill for very long time, or if you miss a pill, or if your schedule changes or if you're under a lot of stress. this is not a symptom of anything being wrong, or of your contraceptive not working, however it can be bothersome. if you do take your pill close to the same time every day and didn't miss any, and you continue to have breakthrough bleeding, you might want to discuss with your healthcare provider the possibility of changing to another brand of contraceptive. so in summary, there is nothing to worry about from the dark discharge you are experiencing or not bleeding during your actual pill free week. if this continues, you may want to consider changing to a different brand of birth control, as increasing your estrogen dose can sometimes help with breakthrough bleeding. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"hi.my 35 y/o boyfriend recently told me of a lump under his ribs on his right side . be can not feel it with his hands , but can just feel it . the last little while he has also been vomiting in the mornings and doesn't have the best appetite . any thoughts ?",1,49709,"hi, i guess what your concern is:- your boyfriend has put his finger in vagina, can i get pregnant though the proper intercourse has not happened, right? you said your boyfriend has wiped his sperms spilled hand with towel. well, you have not shared the information, whether did he wash his hands with soap water, just water, or just wiped his hands? let's assume, he has just wiped off with towel. semen containing sperms is sticky in nature. though he has wiped off with towel, some sort of quantity may be sticking on his hands. imagine you have had a very oily stuff food, and you try to wash your hand even with soap water, but you still feel oily, right?? i hope you got the picture dear. so sperms may be present because of sticky nature of semen, and he might have put it into your vagina causing pregnancy, although there is very, very remote chances. still, medical world is full of miracles, i cannot say you are 100% safe from pregnancy, and you say you are waiting for your menses. that adds to our confusion. the funny sensation in your stomach-its just psychological, and before this sensation you had unprotected sex, so your mind is hitting on it. you are young, accidentally had unprotected sex, and so you are getting worried about pregnancy positive. its natural. all women goes through this stage.i can understand your situation. well you can try out my suggestions:1. have patience and wait for your menses. sometimes menses get altered because of stressful lifestyle.2. get urinary pregnancy test done to confirm pregnancy. much urine pregnancy test kit are available at medical stores at affordable prices. buy it, and do it yourself. if negative, you are on safe side.2. if positive, visit your nearby gynecologist for further treatment.3. if negative, still not getting menses. even then, i suggest you to visit nearby gynecologist to not only rule out pregnancy but also to verify if there are any reasons that's causing delay in your menses. i hope this information was useful, informative and helpful. let me know if i can assist you further."

a have pain in the bottom of my left foot when a walk . the more a walk the worse it gets . a have been using heating pad with no good results . a haven to stepped on anything that may have caused this . a do have neuropathy in this foot . any thoughts ? a appreciate your time .,1,48791,"hi, thank you for providing the brief history of you. a thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised. as your chief complaint is that when you walk there is a sharp pain in the lateral side of the left foot, i suspect it to be muscular pain or either neuropathic pain for which a thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised. also. when there is a nerve impingement in the lumbar spine, it all starts with the pain in most cases on the lateral side of the foot. as you even mentioned that you had a bony injury in the past, there might be a tendency of abnormal gait during that time and shortening of muscles of the spine due to walking in pain. as i feel, by strengthening the muscles of the core, spine, pelvic floor and lower limbs on both sides you should be able to walk. since the nerve impingement gives the initial symptoms as pain in the lateral side of the foot and progresses over a period of time. so before it gets more on future you can get an mri of lumbar spine and them proceed with physical therapy for the lumbar spine. in my clinical experience i see cases who initially comes with this sort of pain and later with nerve impingement diagnosis. so, from past couple of years i have noticed that this is the first alerting symptom of the neurological pain, so now i deal with first an mri of spine and core stability. results come on 3-4 weeks of time and post which in future complaints are less regards jay in chat doctor."

"a am a 59 year old post menopausal female who has just been diagnosed with a bacterial infection in my chest . a also was told a had blood in urine but showing no infection in the urine . by doctor says it can be caused by stress or dehydration . an you tell me more ? also a am very tired and have just finished my antibiotic treatment today.thank you , marsha",1,30687,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the number of white and red blood cells in your urine has nothing to do with an std or pregnancy. urinary tract infections typically cause bacteria, a substance called leukocyte esterase, and nitrites to be present in your urine. red blood cells can also appear if the inside of your bladder is inflamed from the infection. however, the presence of red blood in your urine can also be caused by other conditions of the kidneys or bladder that cause bleeding without infection. the most common of these is a kidney stone, and if you have had very severe pain in your back or lower pelvis, especially on one side, that diagnosis is also possible. pregnancy or stds do not generally cause blood to be seen in the urine. if you are concerned about pregnancy or std exposure, these can be tested separately, but you do not have to be concerned about these conditions because of the presence of blood cells in your urine. i hope i was able to answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

a have red like rash on my inner thigh at panty line an now looks like blisters from a burn not sure what it is or could've caused it . some times get the redness when a wear panties and a put little a an a ointment on it an goes away . showed up over night want there yesterday .,1,34552,"the only thing for a cold sensation i can think of is acid reflux. when you get heart burn it feels crazy and can give anxiety (hence the rapid heart rate). you can remedy acid reflux (herd, or heart burn, throat burn or whatever you want to call it) by getting some digestive enzymes (try something like source naturals daily digestive enzymes) at a local vitamin store (or try vitacost.com) and till give her enough digestive juices to help grind up her food better. also, food intolerances will cause problems too. i discovered a food intolerance to wheat, milk and peanuts. but you have to write down how you feel after you eat something and try eliminating it for a while and see how it goes. you can ask a doctor for an elisa test (for food allergies) but it doesn't tell us much. a food elimination/rotation diet is much better plus it can't hurt. a sharp knife like feeling is definitely heart burn from what i've felt or heard about. make sure you write down when these things occur, what time and how long (dates) and what she had to eat earlier. pizza is a biggie on heart burn. hot dogs, anything with bad fats in it. bread if she is intolerant to wheat and so on. i would throw in a thyroid (tsh) test for hyper or hypothyroidism. so many symptoms stem from those diseases (difficulty breathing, rapid heart rate, digestion issues and so on)...that it should be warranted just to rule it out. and if it keeps happening see the doc. but sometimes i do believe we have to be our own detectives. my dd has a friend that was ill on and off for a couple of years and saw 11 doctors (hello, aren't they supposed to be intelligent beings?) but no, they couldn't figure out anything. finally, they figured out she has a gluten-allergy."

a recently had a third port-a-cath inserted for chemo . the first one was on the left side but the surgeon was unable to reinsert because of scar tissue in the blood vessel that occurred after the port-a-cath was removed . a have been having head fullness and even picking up anything or bending over slightly makes my head feel full and my face all red . is this because of the scar tissue ? something is not draining fast enough ?,1,87329,"hi, thanks for writing in to us. splenomegaly is a common complication of cirrhosis. many cirrhotics have platelet counts in the 60,000s. it is not something to worry about. and it doesn't need to be treated. you have plenty of platelets to properly clot your blood. blood flows from the spleen...through the portal vein...then through the liver. scar tissue in the liver (cirrhosis) can interfere with that blood flow, causing pressure to build up in the portal vein (portal hypertension), and the spleen to enlarge (splenomegaly). as the spleen enlarges, it traps platelets. (the amount of platelets in the bloodstream is reduced because the spleen is busy trapping them). so usually people with cirrhosis end up having a problem with portal hypertension and an enlarged spleen, and a reduced platelet count in the bloodstream. as time goes by, the liver may try to repair itself by growing new cells. if there is a lot of scar tissue already present the new cells grow between scar tissue (and result in abnormal nodules). the nodules and scar tissue further interfere with blood flow through the liver. so over time people with advanced cirrhosis can end up having a problem with more and more abnormal nodules and scar tissue forming which interferes even more with blood flow through the liver which makes the spleen continue to enlarge, and the platelet count continue to chat doctor. the splenomegaly is usually not reversible. please go for regular medical follow up. hope this helps"

i doc i am on 16 day but still not ovulated . by right over size is 24 a left is 16 . of is 9.6 . right now i am on my way to get injection to rupture my over . an a ply tell me most injection how long it takes to actual rupture a when should i have intercourse,1,62120,"you seem to be on the right track. i would have appreciated if you had mentioned the size of the follicle; however, since the doctor has given injection to induce ovulation, the size must be around or more than 18 mm. the life of the ovum or the unfertilized egg is 24 hours. it takes up to 36 hours for the follicle to rupture after the injection, however it may rupture earlier also. so considering the life of ovum, intercourse up to 72 hours is fruitful, not after that. remember that the life of sperms is up to 72 hours. so if at all this cycle goes waste, from next time try to start the intercourse about 4 days prior to the expected ovulation or injection origin and continue up to 48 hours after the ovulation (confirmed by ultrasonography). intercourse may be performed on alternate days if daily is not possible. of course continuing intercourse even after that has no harm. it is not harmful to the pregnancy."

hello a am a 22 or old young lady and a have been bothered with the dark spots caused by mosquitoes bite from an early age . they a on the back of my legs and on my leg arm . a have tried gels and creams used for bleaching to see if they would lighten them they have but its going very slow and a am scared of them side effects . it times i do use repellents but they always seem to find somewhere to bite . a badly need a remedy .... an i do a chemical peel ?,1,96183,"i'm female 22 yrs and i also have really dark circles under my eyes. i tried all the creams and gels at pharmacies and none of them worked. i was diagnosed with vitamin b12 deficiency which causes dark under eye circles. it took me years to get a diagnosis because physicians don't generally test b12 levels especially if your cbc counts are normal. i had lots of routine blood work done, and they all came back normal. a few months ago i was experiencing severe tingling (i had other symptoms too, but the tingling was most bothersome) so i told my new doctor to test me for absolutely everything that can cause it. my b12 level came back at 30 which is extremely low. the funny thing about it was that i took b12 vitamins all the time... so my body just wasn't absorbing them. you should also consider getting tested for celiac disease - if you have symptoms associated with it - because it deprives your body of important vitamins. i'm sure there are products or something out there that helps dark circles, but it won't help if you have an underlying condition."
