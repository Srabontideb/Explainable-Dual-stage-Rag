a believe a have a spider bite in my ankle which has become infected . skin is very red and seems to have a blister like bump in centre . in antibacterial cream does not seem to have helped . a have had this for about a. week . an you please give me some medical advice . thank you .,1,16112,"hi, welcome to chat doctor. many of the spider bites usually do not cause much harm except for some spiders like black widow spider and brown recluse spider. your symptoms are suggestive of a brown recluse spider bite where the skin around the bite wound swells and reddens due to a local reaction. such wounds should be cleaned thoroughly to avoid secondary bacterial infection. based on the symptoms you have mentioned in your query, i suspect the above scenario where your wound was not attended to in time and secondary bacterial infection has occurred leading to cellulitis. cellulitis is caused by bacteria like staphylococcus and streptococcus. you were correctly treated by broad spectrum antibiotics as cellulitis spreads very fast and cause septicemia. hope i have helped you with this answer. thanks."

why is it overtime i eat my chest and and oesophagus tighten and become very painful making breathing very difficult it also causes me to vomit and usually will stop after that . it sometimes happens right after the first bite or a couple bites in but i always have this issue when eating,3,24397,"there are quite a long list of other therapies for the pain. the operation issue intrigues me because the shoulder and the back are not connected. and the shoulder if it is the part down below the neck is inside the chest and doesn't get much wear and tear. if it is at the neck, then neck disk disease is very, very common and almost always shows up on regular x-rays. but. has nothing to do with back and legs in the vast majority. back to pain management: there are multiple levels. obviously the first level is what is broken and fixing it with the surgery. the second level is the pain produced from the problem. nerve pills sometimes work. muscle relaxants sometimes work. amitriptyline is both a nerve pill (like lidocaine) and a blocker of pain signals at the spine. the third level is the context in which the pain is held. while lately everyone is talking about mindfulness and yoga, frankly you might as well try a fidget spinner. i am highly dubious about all of them. but, having the pain be directed by oneself and having it decrease is known to be among the most effective modulators of pain. so, if you can do exercise or physical therapy in the context of making it painful, then the pain experience is less after creating the pain and with repeating it the pain goes down (except during the physical therapy where it goes up for the first 2 months then stabilizes but is still painful)."

"hi my name is stamina , i wanted to ask about my lower abdominal pain i keep getting for a couple of months overtime me and my husband have intercourse , but all tests have come back negative the pelvic inflammatory disease , chlamydia and urinary tract infection i have also taken a full course of antibiotics , but no solution , i only get this pain during sex and while in urinating when being on my menses other wise done revise i have this pain i.m normal a you please help me , in confused !",1,99220,"hello madam, i have gone through your problem. two things can be the cause of this problem. 1. urinary tract infection2. pelvic inflammatory disease in females the urethra is 4 cms in lengtchatdoctorpared to 17 cms in males. do this short length the bacteria which is usually present in the genital region can easily migrate up to the urinary bladder and can cause urinary tract infection which is called as cystitis. urinary tract infection is common in females when compared to males. in the second case, you have an intrauterine device (iud) placed one year back. since one year you had no complaint like this. but now you may be having pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) which can be due to this iud. my advice is to consult your gynecologist immediately and get a check-up done. simultaneously she can get an urinalysis along with urine culture and sensitivity done for you. if your problem is due to iud, then you need to take antibiotic course and need to get rid of iud and choose other alternative method. if you have a urinary tract infection, a course of antibiotics is usually sufficient. good luck and wish you a fast recovery."

"a had a tah on dec 16 and my belly still seems swollen is this normal and a am wondering if possible around certain times of the month your body can still feel like it is going through pms and would you have bloating and cramping , even though a had a tah",1,52955,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. in the first trimester of pregnancy, your ovaries produce the hormone progesterone which normally is made by the placenta once it reaches adequate size. so it is not unusual in the first trimester pregnancy to feel pain in your ovaries. in addition, as your uterus stretches, you also may experience some cramping and pulling sensations, which can be on the sides. the only thing that is concerning is if you have not had an ultrasound this pregnancy to confirm that it is normal and located in your uterus. if you already have had an ultrasound for this pregnancy it is unlikely that there could be anything harmful going on, especially if you are not bleeding. so if the pain is severe enough that you cannot function, especially if you have not yet had an ultrasound, if you cannot reach her doctor within a reasonable amount of time, you may want to pursue care in an emergency setting. if you have had a normal ultrasound earlier in this pregnancy, you really do not need to worry, as your ovaries are normally examined as part of your pregnancy ultrasound and a large cyst would've already been detected. tylenol, or acetaminophen is safe to use for pain at the normal adult dosage during all trimesters of pregnancy, and you can try to see if that helps with the pain. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

"i may last year a got diagnosed with fibrodenoma in left breast at the side i had a biopsy done while there . due to have it removed a month ago due to pain , but while there chickened out . since my breast is in loads of pain , breast looks bigger than right breast . a a really worried due to loosing my dad last year to cancer a be been panicking and googling none stop .",1,82366,"hello friend, thank you for posting your query through chat doctor. i am a homeopath answering your query and the answer which i am going to give you may contain several thoughts which may appear strange or new for you. this i say because homeopathy is a new system of medicine and is almost unheard by the majority of the population. therefore, due to the high influence of the conventional medicine the people at large are brainwashed to believe and act according to the health education given by them. coming back to the fibroadenoma of your left breast in the year 1979, you had a psychological conflict in the mind level. you are a sensitive individual and that is why your left breast was affected. it must have been related with your child chat doctor. the sensitivity is genetic, and you reacted to the conflict through the brain according to a genetic programming. mind-brain - organ affection resulted in the development of a lump in your left breast in 1979. you consulted your gynecologist, and he suggested that it may turn to become cancerous in future and so it is better to remove it, and you subdued to his suggestion. actually the lump in the breast was an attempt of the body to cure you, or it was the result of a self defense mechanism. since you had not resolved the conflict in the psychological level, the lump remained there without getting resolved. but the body kept the lump protected in a cyst with minimum amount of inflammation called chronic cystitis. by removing the fibroadenoma or chronic cystic mastitis, you were not cured, but your lump in the breast was removed. in 1995 also you are the same person, you are the same sensitive person, and you underwent another more serious psychological conflict and the same left breast was again affected in a more serious manner. instead of recognizing the mass as a defense mechanism, you got the fear in you that you have cancer. the tissue changes also suggested that there is more serious pathology, and they labelled your lump this time as cancer and suggested removal of your left breast. if you could have recognized the lump as a defense mechanism and if you had no fear of cancer, you could have retained your breast. but the fear of cancer is such that it is associated with death and so you lost your breast. in no case, either by removal of lump in 1979 or by removal of your breast in 1995, you are not cured only your disease is cured. hope by this time you have got the answer for your query. both are related to each other because they are in the same individual, same sensitivity, same program. homeopathy cures the person and once the individual is cured all his diseases will be cured. with best wishes,"

"a had unprotected sex with a girl who went and had the birth control stick implanted in her , after only 3 days and may have came in her . since she is on the birth control she probably inst pregnant right ? the doctor said that it works right away but we should wait a week and did not .",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

a have a small lump on the lower left back side . of course my first thought was a have cancer ! ! but it hast changed size and it moves around easily . its on top on my hip bone and i think its on a nerve because sometimes there a shooting pain that goes throw my leg . but then again it could just be my arthritis . it also feels restless when i try to go to sleep . i know i should see a doctor but right now i need to know what it most likely could be because in freaking out !,1,21962,"dear simone, there is one rule for doctors here in croatia: when you think too much, stop, and think again, but this time think for the simplest diagnose. if you have pain in abdomen and an umbilical hernia seen on us then the first thing to think about is ""abdominal pain caused by hernia"":). there are many conditions in medicine where pain doesn't need to beau localized near the ""pathology"". sometimes pain can be felt on the opposite side of the affected organ. it is known that one of common symptom of myocardial infarction is pain in the left shoulder. also, infection of the abdominal organs can give many types and localizations of pain. the reason for it is simple: when i see pain, i see nerves, not organs (this is my own phrase:)). nerves conduct pain, and nerves are all around, going from periphery to the brain, so pain can be localized on its pathway, so just let's go back to your problem. doctor should tell you the size of hernia and its content which can be only preperitoneal tissue, momentum or even intestines. this dark triangle...mmm.it can be nothing and everything. i usually don't trust our ultrasonographer because they are strange people... sometimes they don't see what they need to see, or they see what they don't need to see. all i see is that us is operator-dependent diagnostic test... but we shouldn't underestimate this finding. it can be uterine moma, endometriosis, cyst or tumor. and yes, it can cause pain you're describing. so what you need to do: 1. ct scan of pelvic and abdominal region. why? as i said, these us findings are always doubtful, ct is a high sensitive test which will find the exact problem for sure. it will tell you the size and severity of hernia and the morphology of this uterine lesion. it can also find some other problems in its early phase."

i had blood in my urine and low throbbing back pain .. it feel like static pain right now ... the pain has shifted mostly to the front of my lower tummy way low around the overlie into the fold of my leg area and the pain shoots down my leg ... it spreads toward the hip eases up then comes back stronger,1,31108,"hello. thank you for posting your query. the medicines help in reducing the initial inflammation and masking the pain. you need a good assessment of your back. the actual diagnosis of a low back pain depends upon the age of the patient, cause of the pain, and certain tests need to be done. does your pain radiate into the leg or is it just in the lower back (where you tie your belt)? if it radiates into the leg then that is a red flag symptom and needs immediate assessment. if the pain is on and off in the waist region and does not radiate then you can be less worried. the best treatment of any low back pain is to exercise well and make your back and abdominal muscles very strong. the core muscles mainly the multitudes and the erector spinal protect and support the spine. you should visit a certified or tho physiotherapist, and he would teach you exercises to strengthen your muscles. generally a 3-month-long exercise program strengthens the spine sufficiently that then you should not suffer from pain. some examples of exercises that you can look up on the internet are1. bridging exercises2. straight leg raise3. static abdominal towel press4. knee to chest5. hip abduction/ extension these are the basic exercises that will help your pain, but you definitely need to visit a good physical therapist. get well soon!!!"

"been on later for 8 months now and a have had regular periods that last 4-5 days , this month a started spotting on my active pills this has lasted for 5 days and now a am on my second sugar pill and a am still spotting , a take my birth control properly everyday at the same time what could this mean ?",1,27194,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. tri-sprintec is a birth control pill that has a traffic regimen; which means that each color pill in the package has a slightly different dose of hormones. occasionally, women who take traffic pills may have some spotting in the first few days after each pill strength changes over the course of the month. this may cause some slight bleeding or spotting when were not supposed to have your period. whenever you had vaginal bleeding, regardless of the cause, usually there is some cramping that accompanies it. furthermore, it is not unusual to have irregular bleeding or spotting in the first 3 months of pill use. both sprinter and tri-sprintec are considered low-dose birth control pills, however there are many brands on the market that have a lower dose of estrogen than the pill you are currently taking. so you may have less irregular bleeding and spotting on a different kind of monophasic (same dose all month) birth control pill. regarding pregnancy, the chance of your conceiving while taking birth control pills and using a condom is basically nonexistent. so i believe the symptoms you were experiencing are side effects due to the new birth control pill. if your desire is for lighter, regular periods, a different brand of monophasic pill may work better for you with fewer side effects. i hope i was able to adequately answer questions today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

a currently had intercourse about a week ago & there a a possibility that i could be pregnant . by cycle usually comes on around the 10th of each month . this morning there was a brown discharge & in sort of cramping . does this mean in not pregnant and my cycle is coming on ?,2,77227,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, i want to clarify, if you are virgin and have not had sexual intercourse or ejaculation directly in the opening of your vagina, your chance of pregnancy is really nonexistent. sperm die when exposed to air, so there is no way that you can become pregnant from sperm that ejaculated outside the vagina. furthermore, is very uncommon to find women who ovulate during their menstrual cycle. therefore, you were most likely not at the fertile time of your cycle when you and your boyfriend had genital contact. furthermore, irregular bleeding can be caused by travel, changes in weight, hormonal imbalances and stress, especially the stress of worrying about getting pregnant. just because your period was light this month does not mean that there was anything wrong. now omens menstrual cycle is exactly the same every month, and as long as you got a period at the usual time, there is no reason to suspect pregnancy if the bleeding was different in quality than what you usually see. so i think that it is fine to be reassured that you did not conceive from this encounter with your boyfriend. if you continue to have irregular menstrual cycles for more than three months, you may want to visit your local physician as some hormonal imbalances can cause these problems and should be tested for. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was reassuring. best wishes,"

"hi there , i have a question to ask you please.i have my son he is 10 months old i want to stop breastfeeding him , so i am looking for some kind of beverage that is nutritious for him to take i done know if hotlinks malted beverage will be a good choice",1,49529,"hello madam, thank you for asking at chat doctor. i went through your history and understand your concern. i would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. in general, i would suggest exclusive breastfeeding (nothing but breastfeeding, even not water) to baby up to 6 months of age. this is because breast milk helps to build immunity of the baby and protects him from many infections. so i would suggest you to try to shift him on only breast milk as early as possible. you can gradually increase breastfeeding and gradually decrease formula.2. it is good sign that with breastfeeding, he is urinating more. but if he feels hungry quickly, it means whole breast is not getting empty. i would like to mention here that the first part of breastfeeding (foremilk) contains more water and the last part of breastfeeding (hind milk) contains more solids. so at present, he is getting more of watery part from breastfeeding. so please make sure that when you breastfeed him, whole of the breast is getting emptied first, then only offer the other breast. this will satisfy his appetite.3. to ensure better nutrition for him, i would suggest you to take plenty of fluids during day and a nutritious diet so that he will get nutrients from the breast milk. please avoid stress and be relaxed while breastfeeding as it is very important for milk production and milk let down.4. i would suggest you not to worry about occasional gas and change in bowel habits as it is common during first 4-6 months of life. 5. if still he is not satisfied and not gaining weight over time, then only i would suggest you formula or any feeds other than breast milk as per doctors guidance. hope above suggestions will be helpful to you and solves your query. should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at chat doctor. wish your baby the best of the health. thank you & regards."

(many couples seek help at six to nine months, though, which is fine if you're getting anxious about your failure to conceive.) having sex every day does not decrease your chances of getting pregnant. i hope that helps, and good luck!"

"yes my father was diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with mitral valve regurgitation . be has not had surgery for it , quit smoking 6 years ago , does not have high blood pressure , is not over weight , and recently has an increase in shortness of breath with light activity and occasional increase in tingling down his arm .... what should we do ? our cardiologist cant get him into their office until february 22",1,100009,"greetings! thank you for your question and welcome to chat doctor. i carefully read your query. mitral valve prolapse (mvp) is a benign condition that is estimated to be found in 16% of young ladies, and it may take up to forty or fifty years to produce symptoms, only after a chronic mitral regurgitation is installed. i would go on and say that further clinical investigation should be in order at this time, but i am quite confident that, if something was wrong with the mitral valve and the mitral regurgitation was there, it would have been told to you during the before 6 months echocardiogram. it would be only when a mitral regurgitation produced by a mitral valve prolapse that would enlarge the left atrium, when the high pressures in the enlarged left atrium would produce shortness of breath and, maybe, rapid heart rate corresponding with an atrial arrhythmia. and it would have shown in the echocardiogram, if the left atrium was enlarged. my opinion is that your problem is not being produced by the mitral valve prolapse, at this moment, at least. however, if this is a worrisome situation to you, then another echocardiogram should be done. of course, if mitral valve is found on a bad shape, after carefully measuring the function, size, and grade of regurgitation, adding to the possible symptoms, it is only then when mitral valve should be surgically replaced. as for the stress side, indeed substantial amounts of stress have their clear effect on the heart, by putting it to a significant dynamic state and by producing a chat doctor. there are a lot of natural means to reduce stress, starting from self-fighting of the stress to yoga or other methods. if this becomes problematic to you and affects your quality of life and work, i would recommend you a consult with a clinical psychologist regarding a course of sedatives to reduce it. i hope i was helpful. best regards."

"i a talking at my mother she is 56 year old . she can to trust to anyone , she is angry and reacting on small-small things . talks much more on it.she is doing more work so as she may want to busy the whole day . due to this she said i a busy the whole day.the whole family disturbed especially my father . he is retired . please help me the problem is serious .",1,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

( misspelled ) had a physical in january and blood sugar is good . should a call my doctor ? off and on today a feel the same pain .,2,98003,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the greatest likelihood in your situation is that you have gestational diabetes. the majority of the time during routine prenatal care for diabetes somewhere between 24 and 28 weeks. ketones, a byproduct of sugar metabolism being present in your urine along with sugar backs up the diagnosis. if you're test for gestational diabetes was performed more than a month ago, or if you never had one, i suggest you share these results with your healthcare provider as they may want to repeat the test. gestational diabetes can be controlled sometimes with diet, however many women require oral hypoglycemics or insulin to control their blood sugar. this risk is increased in women who are obese or who have a family history of diabetes. so needing additional help in reducing your blood sugar during pregnancy is common and is not the fault of an inability to properly follow a proper diet. so i suggest for the benefit of the health of your pregnancy that you make an appointment with your prenatal care provider and that you discuss your results with them, they may want to do more intensive screening for diabetes and depending upon the level of your blood sugar may prescribe medications. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

(regular use of emergency pill is harmful)conception occurs if she was in 10th to 18th day of her cycle(in a regular cycle of 28 day duration). you can ask her at what day she is in and wait for next cycle to occur. if it delayed by 7 days then get done upt to diagnose if pregnant and then the required treatment can be taken. regards"

"hello doc , my teeth are not aligned in a perfect way .. after my milk teeth are gone , my permanent teeth have erupted in such a way that a tooth is completely pushed back from the rest of the teeth on my lower jaw due to which brushing that particular tooth becomes a difficult task and also it doesn't look good .. how can a get the dentist arrange them neatly ? is the any solution for this ?",1,78347,"hello, i can understand your concern and think of two possibilities for the grayish line you have described on the front teeth. firstly, if you took iron supplements during pregnancy or after childbirth, it may have entered the children bloodstream in uterus or through breast milk. the front teeth are developing in the uterus and matures in bone during initial months after birth, which may cause development of such lines. however, if this was the case, the line should have been present when the tooth erupted into oral cavity. as she has history of falling, it is quite a possibility that she may have damaged her front teeth. the teeth may not break or crack, but the pulp inside the tooth may have died making the tooth appear dark. invariably, this pulp would be infected and should be treated as the tooth is going to stay in oral cavity till your daughter ages 8-9 years. if this is the case, then she might need to go for lumpectomy procedure for the affected teeth. one more possibility is presence of plaque on the teeth due to inadequate oral hygiene and lack of proper tooth brushing. this can be removed by ultrasonic scaling procedure performed by the dentist in any case, i would recommend you to visit a dentist for examination of the line as confirmed diagnosis can be made only after physically looking at the teeth and the line you have described. if it is developmental, then no treatment is needed, and it will be gone with the milk tooth shedding. in case of any other reason, treatment will be required as described. i hope this information helps you. thank you for choosing chat doctor. take care. best,"

(as you said he has difficulty in walking now). you can also say to his parents that --- they can continue with all religious customs along with medicines, may be then they will agree... with medicine, he will start showing improvement in few days only... it is psychosis and patients will not agree to go to any doctor willingly, so you might need to take him forcefully. this is well accepted as it is for his benefit only. even if he doesn't agree for oral medicine there are injectables which are given to such patients... take the right step, take him to a doctor. hope the reply is useful feel free to ask more questions"

by baby 9 months has gastritis this is day 6 ... we have been to the doctor twice and casualty once and sent home without treatment . next step is to take a stool sample and get tested . but my main question is do we starve her ? she is taking a little bit of milk and she managed to keep down some baby cereal this morning and a tiny bit of banana at tea time . a am getting conflicting opinions about offering her food but she has gone 6 days without a meal and getting the diralyte into her is very difficult but we are sticking to it .,1,33660,"hi there, the backed up stool and tendency to urinary tract infection does point to the idea that she could be constipated, despite being regular. regarding the frequency of bowel movements, do note that different people tend to have different bowel needs, up to 3 times a day is accepted as normal. so she could actually be going daily and still be relatively constipated. what we are aiming for is the right consistency of stools, which is long and sausage-like, with or without cracks. if you need more visual guidance, look for the bristol stool chart online, and aim for type 3 or 4. it is good that she is taking enough fibers, but also pay attention to her habits and stress to her that she needs to go when she feels like it even if it is more than once a day. constipation often occurs at this age because this is when they are getting better at holding it in, and prefer other exciting activities to sitting in the toilet. the other rarer possibility would be that she has a mild form of hirschsprungs disease, which means that some nerves are missing from the end of the colon, making the evacuating of stool difficult. most people have this diagnosed as babies, but if its very mild it can be missed. it might be more likely if she had delayed bowel movement more than a day after birth, or had tendency to constipation even as a baby. you will have to discuss with your doctor on this possibility, because confirmation would be needed with a rectal biopsy. hope this helps, and all the best to you."

"i went to affordable dentures today to have my teeth fixed they did a great job but in so tired and these partial hurts me bad , they did the same day extraction and up in a partial plate . i took it out and it is still unbearable ... they said for me to sleep in then and . the pain beds are not working please please tell me what to do ?",1,10744,"tithe number of missing teeth are more than what would be advised for a fixed partial denture. ideally implants would be the best solution for your problem. with newer techniques the implants are placed with simple punch cut in which only the spots where implants have to be placed is punched out. extraction on the other hand is a much bigger and traumatic procedure than this. still if you do not want implant then you have only 2 options: flexible dentures and cast partial dentures. flexible dentures are easy to adjust, but cast partials are more stable and better for the health of the remaining teeth in the long run. regards"

"a few weeks ago a had 3 teeth pulled on the upper left side , a think pm healing pretty well , however now a have been feeling like a cold sensation in my left ear it doesn't hurt just annoying . also my right ear will all of a sudden start feeling like its popping but its not popping just a sensation as if it is . just wondering if maybe this had anything to do with my dental work or what ? ? thank you",1,98224,"hi ! your operation was done 8 months ago for bilateral inguinal hernia. now you are feeling the same old sensation on the left side only. have you noticed any type of swelling on your inguinal area just as you had before the surgery? if it so, then it could be a recurrence of the hernia on the left side. but due to improvement in the surgical techniques laparoscopically, this is a remote chance even though possible. the other possibility is entrapment of nerve or adhesion of the mesh with any other abdominal viscera, or fibrosis at the site of surgery. if there is no swelling, and not any major problem, you can wait for some more time, and see if the problem subsides of its own. otherwise, you will have to get yourself reviewed by the operating surgeon. wishing you an early recovery."

a frequently have the sensation that my heart is flopping like a fish out of water in my chest . this happens several times a day . a recently had a cardiac stress test and wore a holder monitor for 24 hours . both tests were negative for cardiac problems .,1,14685,"hello and thank you for using chat doctor. i carefully read your question and understand your concern. my opinion is that this floppy sensation on the heart has to do with some rhythm issues. there are some unusual electrical impulses that generates in different part of the heart and stimulate it. they cause an extra electrical stimulus that we call extra-sistolic beat, that's not a normal one. a person that experiences an extra systolic beat might feel a palpitation, a skipped beat, a sensation like the heart is racing or flopping in the chest. you also might feel difficulties in breathing deeply, anxiety etc. there are different causes that might generate this electrical stimulus of the heart, like simple emotional stress, coffee products, alcohol or different pathology like anemia, thyroid gland problem sect. so, if this flopping sensation happen just once in a while, it is normal, you have nothing to worry about. the fact that you have done the cardiac stress test and the holder monitor and they're normal is a very good thing. if the holder has not registered any significant arrhythmia, then we should not worry. so, if i was your treating doctor i will simply recommend you some blood analyze to exclude any anemia and your thyroid hormones to complete the full check up. if they result normal to, then we have nothing to worry. it might be just any random extra-sistolik beat that gives you this flopping sensation. you don't mention your age, but if you are able i will recommend some regular physical activity. sometimes it resolves this rhythm issues and this sensation. hope i was helpful. wish you goo health. best regards."

i am a mother of 10 months old baby girl . the vomits the food often when i feed her . she has been prescribed one syrup 2.5 my for vomiting . when i give one syru0p after vomiting she does not split the food at least for 24 hours.can a please advise me is it safety to give this medicine in alternative days .,1,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

a am 31 year old mother of two . a have been on a combination birth control pill for exactly one month . a took my pill every night . a am on my second day of `` inactive '' pills and a have not started my period . a had sex with a condom once . another time my partner just barely penetrated and a made him stop in fear of pregnancy . should a be worried ?,1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"hello by husband a hemmoragic stroke on march 7 , they said it was a 6.7ml and he is very lucky to be alive . be is penalized on his left side and has basically no short term memory . that does the 6.7 mean ? is this as good as he will probably will get ?",1,105496,"his am chat doctor. i have read your message. i think i can help you. first, i do not think that your prior stroke is involved. what you have described is a type of aphasia neurologically speaking. and aphasia is usually caused by a left sided brain problem-not right like you state in your query. second, if it was truly due to the stroke, the problem would have been since 2009. brain problems in stroke don't get delayed. so, i don't think that your prior stroke has anything to do with the issue. second, the main causes of aphasia are stroke and dementia. it is not a stroke as per prior ct scan, and not dementia-dementia is memory loss, and from the query, your memory is pretty good-you remember the year 2009 clearly (suggests long term memory is good), and you remember the medicines (suggests short term memory is good as well). so like your doctors, i don't think its dementia either. however, i disagree with the choice of investigations- the ct has clearly missed your pre-existing stroke as well. so i cannot be sure whether it has missed a newer stroke as well. so, i would have ideally suggested another mri brain (a more sensitive study than cat scan) and a cv doppler. however, i still don't think it is a stroke. a stroke starts suddenly. and you have definitely not said that there was a sudden onset of symptoms. if however you have forgotten to mention this in the query, you should definitely think about stroke and plan an mri and cv doppler as suggested before. third, a significant history that you have given is the loss of work and lack of hobbies and physical exercises. i won't call it depression or anxiety. and therefore i don't think your medicines will work either. in your case, the age-old adage-all work and no play makes jack a dull boy-is probably most appropriate. so my suggestion is that you need to stop smoking and get some company and daily activities. it may sound odd to you, but inactivity does take its toll. i don't think medicines are needed in your case. you just need to fill in your time with more activities so that your mind is active again. i have tried to make it as simple as possible for you to understand. feel free to ask another query with a specific doubt based on the information i have given you. i would be happy to help you further. best of luck,"

a a taking antibiotics and rinsing my mouth with warm water and salt for a gum infection around the crown of my wisdom tooth ( bottom left ) . a woke up this morning to a pillow with a small pool of blood . still bleeding after a hour and some times a a spitting out dark thick spots of blood amount lighter stands of light red blood,1,5711,hi. thanks for the query as per your complaint sore throat can be seen associated with wisdom tooth related infection and inflammation as the area of wisdom teeth is very close to throat and inflammation from wisdom tooth can even make the throat sore and painful. but runny nose is not commonly seen with sore throat if it is related to wisdom tooth and can be due to other causes like sinus infection or upper respiratory infection. so for this you can consult a physician and get evaluated. for tender gum around wisdom tooth that seems to be due to peritonitis which is inflammation of gum flap due to food accumulation and infection between gum flap and tooth. whether tooth is impacted or not can be ruled out with x-ray. for this consult an oral physician and get evaluated and an x-ray of the tooth will be done.first to reduce infection the area will be irrigated with antiseptic solution followed by a course of antibiotics like augmenting and anti-inflammatory painkillers like ibuprofen. warm saline gargle will also help. once the inflammation reduce then if the wisdom tooth is not impacted then it will be left to erupt. in case if the tenderness recurs then the gum flap will be removed to prevent recurrence. if the tooth is impacted then extraction is the best line of treatment. hope this helps. regards.

""b"" these devices are great for grinding. i prefer hard night guards because the firmness helps prevent them from breaking down and they don't flex like soft night guards which in your sleep may be perceived as food and induce more grinding. i personally use a night guard and found that it has improved my bruise condition greatly. they are well worth the money. best regards and good health"

the other day i noticed that when i ate i was getting a bit of pain on the bottom of the tongue . it continued for a couple of days so looked in a mirror and noticed that on the bottom of the tongue on the left next to where the little vain/vine things are there was a little piece of skin that had apparently broken so its just hanging there . was wondering what can i do to get the pain to go away,1,97758,"hello, though it is little difficult to understand your concern with broken sentences, i am assuming that you are suffering from occasional swelling on lip that has not happened in recent past, white striae on the side of the tongue that will not go and occasional swelling of tongue as well. the swelling you sometimes have on lips and tongue can be an allergic reaction to some food item or medicine as you do not always have it and only sometimes experience it, usually after eating some items. if you get those swellings again, you can take an antihistamine like levocetrizine 5 mg (exocet) once a day for few days and can also make a diary of all the things you eat, so it can help in finding out what substance you are allergic to. the white striae on the side of the tongue are sometimes due to pressing of large tongue over the surfaces of teeth or due to fungal infection/inadequate hygiene of the tongue. moreover, the precancerous lesions you are describing can also persist for a long time, are not removable and are painless. thus, i would advise you to visit your dentist for the physical examination of the white lines and further investigations if needed. in addition, i would advise you to start with multivitamin tablet (b-folcin) once a day for at least a month. many oral lesions are due to just vitamin deficiency, and they clear after correcting the deficit. i hope this information helps. thank you for choosing chat doctor. let me know if you have follow-up questions. best,"

(this is not a common scenario when compared to encountering an antibiotic resistance). so next spike of fever, kindly take your son to er, and it is better to get him admitted in the hospital, do blood and urine test and cultures and treat accordingly after ruling out other infectionsregards"

"a had breast cancer eighteen years ago ; consequently a had a lumpectomy followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy . a year ago a was diagnosed with d.c.i.s . in the same breast , a had this breast removed in july . last week a had my regular blood test ; these tests were not because of cancer . however the results indicate that a have high glucose levels . does this mean that a might have cancer in another part of my body ?",1,82366,"hello friend, thank you for posting your query through chat doctor. i am a homeopath answering your query and the answer which i am going to give you may contain several thoughts which may appear strange or new for you. this i say because homeopathy is a new system of medicine and is almost unheard by the majority of the population. therefore, due to the high influence of the conventional medicine the people at large are brainwashed to believe and act according to the health education given by them. coming back to the fibroadenoma of your left breast in the year 1979, you had a psychological conflict in the mind level. you are a sensitive individual and that is why your left breast was affected. it must have been related with your child chat doctor. the sensitivity is genetic, and you reacted to the conflict through the brain according to a genetic programming. mind-brain - organ affection resulted in the development of a lump in your left breast in 1979. you consulted your gynecologist, and he suggested that it may turn to become cancerous in future and so it is better to remove it, and you subdued to his suggestion. actually the lump in the breast was an attempt of the body to cure you, or it was the result of a self defense mechanism. since you had not resolved the conflict in the psychological level, the lump remained there without getting resolved. but the body kept the lump protected in a cyst with minimum amount of inflammation called chronic cystitis. by removing the fibroadenoma or chronic cystic mastitis, you were not cured, but your lump in the breast was removed. in 1995 also you are the same person, you are the same sensitive person, and you underwent another more serious psychological conflict and the same left breast was again affected in a more serious manner. instead of recognizing the mass as a defense mechanism, you got the fear in you that you have cancer. the tissue changes also suggested that there is more serious pathology, and they labelled your lump this time as cancer and suggested removal of your left breast. if you could have recognized the lump as a defense mechanism and if you had no fear of cancer, you could have retained your breast. but the fear of cancer is such that it is associated with death and so you lost your breast. in no case, either by removal of lump in 1979 or by removal of your breast in 1995, you are not cured only your disease is cured. hope by this time you have got the answer for your query. both are related to each other because they are in the same individual, same sensitivity, same program. homeopathy cures the person and once the individual is cured all his diseases will be cured. with best wishes,"

i have a 10 pm posterior subserosal fibroid and am 5-6 weeks pregnant . the ultrasound shows that the baby sac is pressed against the fibroid and sac is elongated ... i am worried about potential of miscarriage or abnormal growth please advise thanks,1,59414,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. this ultrasound report, translated out of medical jargon, is as follows:there is a pregnant uterus noted with an amniotic sac present, but no fetus visible yet or yolk sac. human fetuses normally have a yolk, just like a chicken egg, usually from about 6 weeks until 9-10 week or so. this report estimates the sac to be about the size for a 5-6 week pregnancy. also, the uterus ""decimal reaction"" and ""bulky"" ovary are also normal during pregnancy. the radiologist recommends repeating another ultrasound in a week or so to check for the development of a yolk sac and a fetus. the heartbeat is usually present by 7 weeks of pregnancy. i hope i was able to explain the meaning of this report for you, and that the information i gave you was helpful and reassuring. best wishes,"

"a am on implants and have been for 6 months with absolutely of period ! last week when i had went to the bathroom i noticed some pink spotting after i wiped from peeing but thought it was nothing .. than today i come home to notice brown discharge and lot of it as if i was on my period again . a have looked on lot of sites and some say it can be pregnancy ? but the last time i have had sexual intercourse was about 2 months ago , can you please help ! in only 14 .",1,8772,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the proper way to use the nearing is to put it in, leave it in for 3 weeks, take it out, wait one week, and replace it. during the week you are not wearing the ring, you should have some bleeding that is considered a menstrual cycle. if you wore the ring continuously for two months and then had a new one replaced but only removed it 3 days later, the pinkish spotting was your ""period"", which is caused by not wearing the ring. the bleeding was very light because you had suppressed it by continuously wearing the ring for over 2 months. so you should expect your next period about 4-5 weeks after the episode of spotting that you had. if you do not have menses by then, i recommend repeating the pregnancy test at that time. if you did not have regular monthly cycles before you used the ring, your cycle will follow your regular pattern that you typically have when not using hormonal contraception. if you are trying to get pregnant, you should have intercourse about every other day and begin taking prenatal vitamins as it benefits the health of the baby for the vitamins to be present at conception. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

hello my friend angela is experiencing chest pains when she breathes . the has felt this way for the past couple of days . the is 25 years old and does not smoke . moderate drink . maybe a glass of win here and there . the says she can breathe but it is hard when her chest is hurting . the has no fever .,3,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"hi- a received a testosterone pellet at the beginning of this past web and have gained 10lbs since ! is this normal , will it go away , what can a do ? a was under the impression a would gain lean muscle and lose weight ? does this take a few rounds to normalize ? a am a female .",1,83431,"hello and welcome to chat doctor. thank you for your query. i can understand your concern and shall ad chat doctor. starting off with your first query, pcs can be diagnosed clinically with the help of symptoms, but still requires a confirmation using an ultrasound, which i advise at the earliest.pcs is a purely hormonal condition, thus affecting women in the reproductive age group, so the c-section would have nothing to do with this, but a hormonal imbalance could easily cause this. the morning after pill has a known side effect to cause irregular bleeding and a change in the usual menstrual cycle, but to an extent equivalent to almost no period without medication, is usually not seen with the morning after pill. this could purely be a hormonal imbalance, and if the pcs diagnosis is right, this could be directly attributed to the condition. the more extensive testing you are talking about would include hormonal levels: estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, rheas, etc.; along with an ultrasound to confirm the suspected diagnosis of pcs. now coming to some extra information, metformin is advised in women diagnosed to have pcs, for two purposes:1. normalize/regularize the menstrual cycle2. loss of weight (in woman who are slightly obese)if you indeed have pcs, and have noticed an increase in weight since the time when your cycles were normal, this could also be attributed to the weight gain. pcs gets worse with weight gain, if you have put on weight, i would advise losing it. it is difficult to calculate your day 1 right now, as your periods are very irregular. let us wait till your periods are normalized, and then calculate the day 1. i would also like to add, that metformin, birth control pills, hormonal supplements, etc.; will all be used to normalize your period. women with pcs require a certain medication to help conceive (camphene), so this will be initiated only once your period is regular again, only once this is initiated, can you successfully conceive. i hope i have succeeded in providing the information you were looking for. please feel free to write back to me for any further clarifications at: .com/doctors/"

i a have this cough for about 2 weeks which a think could of been caused by been exposed to bleach as one day a used it too much to clean with and felt in my chest since that something is not right.what should i do ? am a in danger and what kind please thank a,1,87733,"hello, i read your message and understood your medical issue. i see that you have a persistent chat doctor. i don't know what you have used to treat it, but this is quite a long period of time for the symptom to be self-limited even if left without any treatment. when laughing, much more pressure develops inside the pulmonary system which makes the obstruction of the airways to become more evident. chest discomfort and the sense of pressure in the chest followed by a more severe cough especially after a physical efforts are signs that show that the pulmonary function is getting down. it can be due to pneumonia of course or as a side effect of the previous pneumonia episodes. in this case, the pulmonary function is reduced because of atelectasis which is the substitution of the pulmonary tissue with fibrous tissue. anyway, i do not think that this is your case even though i do not expel it as a differential diagnosis. what i think is a possibility of herd (gastroesophageal reflux disease) which has not been treated adequately and might have caused aspiration pneumonia. anyway further tests are needed to rule it out and treat it adequately like chest x-ray, upper endoscopy and a good physical examination. bronchitis may become chronic and may lead to more severe pulmonary disease like copd. my suggestion is that you must see your doctor and do the respiratory tests to evaluate the function of your lungs. chest x-ray is very important in this case. it can be due to an allergic reaction as well. maybe you are constantly exposed to the allergic substance that causes obstruction to the airway and produces the symptoms. mediastinum organs like large vessels, trachea, lymph nodes etc. must be evaluated. tumors in this region, also the pulmonary tumors are not usual and if found they are successfully treated. my advice is that you must do at least the pulmonary tests, a chest x-ray and all the random laboratory examinations and if you can do the allergic tests. hope this is helpful for you."

hi . someone i know had under gone 2 major surgeries because of a haemorrhage on the skull . he is a heart patient and takes morphine . for the surgery the doctors had to stop morphine . the 2 surgeries were successful but there were 2 clots . the clots are not disappearing and he is too weak to perform a surgery to remove the clots . the clots are currently in the neck as shown by scans taken 2 days ago . the patient is currently paralysed according to doctors . they want to air lift the patient to london and give him therapy to eradicate the clots . what else can be done to get the patient back to a stable condition ? thanks,1,41978,"hello welcome to chat doctor you have not mentioned here why is he on warfarin. warfarin is a blood thinner which is prescribed if a person has propensity to develop or has developed clots in the legs, in patients with irregular heart rate (af) and in patients post valve replacement. i would be in a better position to help you had you provided the details. coronary angiogram is done to evaluate presence of blockages in the heart. on baii of the findings of angiogram you may be suggested either medical management, or angioplasty or bypass surgery. angioplasty can be done if there are short blockages on the arteries. it is a 1-3 hr procedure that can be done in the same sitting and the patient usually gets back on his legs on the next day. bypass surgery is advice when there are multiple widespread blockages involving the major arteries of the heart. bypass surgery requires planning, patient preparation etc. again it takes about 4 days to patient to be back on his legs and some 20 days to recover totally. but the long term results of bypass are very good. since he is diabetic he has a tendency to develop heart blockages so be prepared for an angioplasty if suggested. i suppose i have answered your queries satisfactorily. wishing him good health. regards"

"cutting down brambles in garden yesterday and got a small splinter/thorn . finger was red , swollen and painful last night . managed to remove the splinter and put on antiseptic cream . 12 hrs later and finger not as swollen but still a bit , hard to bend and stiff and painful . oozing clear fluid if a press ( looked to see if any small part behind and can not see anything though hard when swollen ( and on left hand which is my strong hand so needle wobbles ! ! ! )",1,14960,"hi there, and thank you for your question. i appreciate your concern here, and i shall try and help where i can. bramble thorns break off quite easily and can lodge under the skin due to their size and sharpness. the issue though is that the tips of the thorns tend to break off and embed themselves under the skin. in effect, the body regards this splinter as a foreign body under the skin and an inflammatory reaction occurs. blood rushes to the site of the wound in order to get white cells in the area to try and destroy the foreign body. that is why the finger would swell and become red and tender. the swelling then came down as you removed the splinter and the healing process can continue without there being a foreign body in the way to complicate matters. the clear fluid would be plasma that escapes which was formed as part of the initial foreign body reaction. you can continue applying the antiseptic cream for a couple more days just to help prevent an infection from occurring. the issue should then resolve on its own with the swelling decreasing on a daily basis. if the swelling, tenderness and redness starts to worsen then i would suggest seeing your doctor to assess the situation. either there's then a secondary infection or there still is a foreign body stuck at the site of the wound. i hope this helps and good luck."

"a had sex with my fiancee on17 october,2015 , a day before my menses could start on 18th october , 2015 . a experienced delayed menses on 21st october,2015 . but for this month november , 2015 there seem to be nothing yet . that could be the cause to this delay ? pm 21 yes old.thanks",1,106922,"hallow dear, your menstrual cycle though not very regular, is varying between 26 and 29 days; i should say fairly regular. in regular menstrual cycle, the egg is released 14 days prior to the next expected menses. the egg has a life of 24 hours while sperms are active for 72 hours. hence, a period of about a week around the day of egg release is fertile period. considering your period of about 28 days, your expected period was around 14 november and the day of egg release (ovulation) would be around 31 october. this calculates fertile period from 27 october to 4 november. thus, your unprotected intercourse on 10 november falls way outside the fertile period. thus, according to this calculation, you carry very minimal risk of pregnancy due to this intercourse. however, we have to consider your age factor. your age is 47 years; nearing menopause. variation in your menstrual pattern is due to the premenopausal changes. during this period of life, the ovulation is very unpredictable and irregular. not all the cycles are ovulatory. moreover, the menses also may become irregular. thus, it really becomes difficult to calculate the safe period. even if your menses are delayed, you cannot figure out whether these are premenopausal irregularities or possibility of pregnancy. hence, during this phase of life, it is always advisable to use reliable contraceptive like condom. i feel, with this menstrual history and history of intercourse, you stand very minimal, almost no chance of pregnancy. you should get your menses. however, if at all you do not get menses even 40 days after the last menstrual period; i.e. 26 november, perform pregnancy test on overnight first morning urine sample. i hope this helps you."
