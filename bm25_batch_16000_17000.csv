(as you said he has difficulty in walking now). you can also say to his parents that --- they can continue with all religious customs along with medicines, may be then they will agree... with medicine, he will start showing improvement in few days only... it is psychosis and patients will not agree to go to any doctor willingly, so you might need to take him forcefully. this is well accepted as it is for his benefit only. even if he doesn't agree for oral medicine there are injectables which are given to such patients... take the right step, take him to a doctor. hope the reply is useful feel free to ask more questions"

a have had chronic lower back pain due to a harvesting of bone from my left hip . this bone was used in the back of my neck for fusion . a have never had back surgery . the pain is nondescript and no one seems to understand how much pain a truly am in . the only relief is when a sleep ! ! ! a take percocet 10-325 . it slightly takes the edge off but never stops the pain completely . helpppppp this procedure was done april 2009 and a am at my wit a end .,1,43960,"hi, thanks for writing in. your situation needs a more professional approach than taking out all the hardware inserted during surgery and replacing it with cadaver bone. the bone we have within us is a living tissue though it is hard and stronger than other tissues. this is because of calcium deposition and there is regular exchange of minerals between the bone and other tissues. the bone also gets its blood supply and remains alive. therefore, please do not consider cadaver bone replacement for yourself. the problem with two cages and its displacement at operated site requires proper management. back fusion surgeries might not provide a good level of pain relief in some patients. though the pressure on nerve roots at strategic locations seems to be relieved by doing surgical procedure, the patient might often complain severe lower back pain even after surgery. this happens in about 20 to 40 percent of patients and the reason is that the affected nerve roots are still under pressure in areas other than where surgical manipulation has been done. if laser is not an option for you then please discuss new methods like radiofrequency ablation and how effective it will work for you. the problem for your extended suffering was the infection that unfortunately developed in the operated site. now that it is cured, healing should occur fast. wishing you the best for hip surgery."

(regular use of emergency pill is harmful)conception occurs if she was in 10th to 18th day of her cycle(in a regular cycle of 28 day duration). you can ask her at what day she is in and wait for next cycle to occur. if it delayed by 7 days then get done upt to diagnose if pregnant and then the required treatment can be taken. regards"

"hi mam , i am seven month pregnant , today in usb it was found that there is a cord seen in the neck of the baby , so i am worried about it . will it harm to my baby , any there any precaution to be taken , or any way so that baby any tighten the cord . please help me",1,284,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. if your baby is in the head up position at term, it is not recommended that you deliver vaginally, because there is risk to the baby of birth injury. so if you reach your due date with your baby in the head up position, your obstetrician will likely recommend cesarean section. however, there is a possibility that the baby could turn around on its own. ways to help this to happen is to do what you can to let your belly hang to give the baby a chance to rollover. going on your hands and knees and arching your back high into the air, like an angry cat, for 10 minutes every day, can sometimes help the baby to turn around naturally. however, the best way to help the baby to turn around is for your obstetrician or midwife to perform a procedure called a version. in the us, versions, which literally are done by the doctor pushing the baby into a somersault is performed under ultrasound guidance in a hospital setting. it works about 50% of the time and can give a woman a chance at a normal vaginal delivery. regarding the cord around the babies neck, 15% of normally delivered infants have an umbilical cord around their neck. so the presence of the cord around the neck now does not mean that there will be any problems with labor and delivery if the baby is able to get into the right position. if you are considering having a version, i suggest that you speak to your delivering provider about it soon, as the success rates of version decrease significantly after 37 weeks. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and this information was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy and delivery,"

"a went to the dentist for a toothache and thought it might be a problem with my gums right near the tooth , so my dentist said it might be the root surface so he put something on my tooth and gum , and it was not the problem . once a left the dentist office my mouth hurt 10 times worse and noticed a long white welt on my gum like inside my cheek but towards the bottom of the too . it is so painful a can to eat or even talk right . by cheek and where the welt is is so swollen . that can a do for this for the pain to go away and the welt to go away ? and what did the dentist put on my gums to make this happen ? it feels like a burn of some sort .. think that a the only way you can get a welt .",1,85846,"hi. thanks for the query. it looks to be a portion of the gum that might have been accidentally left unattached to the stitches, and it is appearing hanging. so my suggestion is to consult your dentist and get a clinical examination done. in case if the gum is extra and is hanging then he can simply remove it so that it does not cause problem and also if it hangs and get irritated it can become inflamed and painful. so better to either get it stitched to other gums or get it removed. hope this helps. regards."

by left arm is hurting a small bit enough to notice it has a small pee size lump i can feel through the skin my skin is a small bit tight in the elbow bend on top it kinda feels like if a were to get infiltrated when donating plasma it did come earlier this afternoon then went away now its back,1,27232,"dear user, when you get a hard enough blow, it causes blood to collect under the skin if there is no wound hematoma, as we call it. that usually takes 4-6 weeks to go away, even after the redness is gone. it will usually change its color from red to purplish to green and yellow before it completely fades away. if this continues to decrease in size, you don't really need to do anything. just take painkillers and cold compressors as needed. if it becomes redder, or the swelling becomes more painful or increases in size, there are chances it has got infection. in that case you'll have to go your doctor to get it checked. in rare cases it needs operation to clean. there are very minimal chances that this kind of lumps persist after a few weeks, if it does persist though, you might need an x-ray to rule out small fracture, or any other kind of skin lump which you only happened to notice after the injury. do write back if you need more help. thanks"

"by mon is suffering from blood cancer , i am worried , is it curable ?",1,30376,"hello, if i were in your place, would have also been worried. usually, breast cancer and colon cancer are two different cancers without any association between the two. in general, a person has diagnosed with cancer, the risk of him or her developing second cancer is slightly higher compared to normal individuals. usually, colonoscopy is recommended every ten years, in your case, it has been recommended, i presume, for this very reason, to detect early when it is still curable. secondly, usually any cancer takes a certain time to grow, for a precancerous adenoid to become cancer, it will take time. however, it depends upon the type of adenoid, since there are different types ranging from benign with minimal risk of developing into cancer to dangerous ones which have the highest probability in turning into cancer. in order to comment upon your risk, would like to know the details of the precancerous adenoid, whether it is single or multiple, shape (sessile or peculated), etc. whether to wait or not, depends upon the type, i am guessing the adenoid found is one of the mild types and hence the advice of repeat test after 5 years. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further. take care chat doctor."

"i get a burning sensation in my chest that radiates to my left shoulder and arm when i get angry , ,i was diagnosed with high blood pressure and tachycardia , ,my cardiologist gave me tenormin , ,i want to know if i might be having a heart related problem or is it just anxiety ? i am a 25 years old female .. my weight is 44 pkg and my height is 158 pm",1,64589,"greetings. welcome to chat doctor, and thank you for your question. i understand your concern. clearly, you were preoccupied by this new event or sensation you were experiencing. in various stressful situations, both physical or psychological, heart rate and blood pressure are parameters that increase. your age is not very consistent with a coronary artery origin of this pain (i.e. a blockage within the coronary arteries - arteries that encompass the heart as a crown, hence the name, and supply the heart muscle with oxygen and important nutrients). however, angina is more like a squeezing or heaviness felt in the mid-chest which radiates to the throat and jay, and left shoulder and left arm, starts on exertion, is not related to the food intake, and is relieved when the exercise is ceased. i am assuming you are an active and healthy 27-year-old, so this kind of pain would be sensed by you during moderate physical activity. there are other origins of this kind of chest pain. and if it is food-related, then the highest probability is that it has a digestive tract origin. i would recommend you a consult with a gastrohepatologist (digestive tract and liver specialist) to further examine whether this pain is coming from a possible esophageal spasm (the tube that connects the pharynx with the stomach) or it is coming from an abnormal process in the stomach or the early part of the small intestine. an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy may be required for properly assessing these issues. i hope i was of help with my answer. kind regards,"

am 43 year man and from 10 day am feeling miss beating in my heart am diabetic and hypertensive too and i have psoriasis my blood pressure is under control but my sugar is not in under control i regularly exercise 40 minute on cycle tell me the cause ply,1,43362,"hello thanks for posting here. i have gone through your description. your bp seems to be persistently higher despite taking amlodipine daily. verapamil is a stronger blood control medication than amlodipine. but one of its effects is lowering the heart rate, which in your case was lowered too much hence stopped. the amlodipine you are taking is not enough to control your bp and hence it must be changed. if you were my patient, i would start you on tablet selma am which is a combination of telmisartan plus amlodipine which would be an ideal combination for you. it does not lower the heart rate and has beneficial effects on the kidney and heart. the brand name selma am may change from country to country, but telmisartan 40 mg plus amlodipine 5 mg combinations are available worldwide. you can take one tablet of selma am. it will definitely help get your pressure under control. if despite this your blood pressure remains high (after two weeks of starting selma am) you must undergo a 24-hour ambulatory bp monitoring which records your bp every 15-20 mins while you go around your daily routine activities. it gives us an idea of your pressure control, effect of medications, time of day when pressure is high, and also we can correlate high blood pressure with the activity you were doing at that time. so to proceed further, please take the telmisartan amlodipine combination i have advice for two weeks and then follow up. wishing you good health. regards"

"i live been on my birth control pill almost for a year , am sex active but we also use condoms , few weeks ago a had a kidney infection and a was taking very strong antibiotics , i also took my pills like 12 hours later than i should or even more for about 4 or 5days ( didst have sex tough , its not pregnancy for sure ) so now after a finished my antibiotics i noticed a brown spotting it now lasts about for a week , while on my birth control pill and when a finish the packet a get my period about on the 3rd day , today its the 4th -still no period showing and brown spotting is still occurring . hats wrong ?",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"i a am a 22 year old female who has pretty good health . a started the birth control sprinter yesterday and woke up this more feeling very nauseous then followed by fainting . a completely blacked out and hit my head pretty hard , is this a direct side effect of the pill ?",1,27194,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. tri-sprintec is a birth control pill that has a traffic regimen; which means that each color pill in the package has a slightly different dose of hormones. occasionally, women who take traffic pills may have some spotting in the first few days after each pill strength changes over the course of the month. this may cause some slight bleeding or spotting when were not supposed to have your period. whenever you had vaginal bleeding, regardless of the cause, usually there is some cramping that accompanies it. furthermore, it is not unusual to have irregular bleeding or spotting in the first 3 months of pill use. both sprinter and tri-sprintec are considered low-dose birth control pills, however there are many brands on the market that have a lower dose of estrogen than the pill you are currently taking. so you may have less irregular bleeding and spotting on a different kind of monophasic (same dose all month) birth control pill. regarding pregnancy, the chance of your conceiving while taking birth control pills and using a condom is basically nonexistent. so i believe the symptoms you were experiencing are side effects due to the new birth control pill. if your desire is for lighter, regular periods, a different brand of monophasic pill may work better for you with fewer side effects. i hope i was able to adequately answer questions today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"a a on implants and haven to had my period in a year . but of nowhere , a got cramps and the next morning woke up with bleeding . also , a be been taking toyama which a know decreases the effect of the birth control , what are the chances a could get pregnant ?",1,74652,"hallow dear, trust pills are birth control pills having ethanol estradiol, levonorgestrel and ferrous fumarate. the last is iron to complete 28 days. first two are the hormonal components which give the effect of birth control. after getting the menses, you shifted to daphne which contains lynestrenol (progesterone). both these pills are good birth control pills provided they are consumed regularly. however, i would suggest you to stick to trust. you had sexual intercourse 3 days after your menstruation while on the pills. so the chances of the pregnancy are very rare. when you are taking birth control pills regularly, you are well protected from the pregnancy, whenever you may have intercourse. moreover, your intercourse was not during the fertile period. !4 days prior to the next menses (when you are not on pills), the egg release (ovulation) occurs. egg has got a life of 24 hours and sperms are active for 72 hours. hence, a period of about one week around the day of ovulation is considered as fertile period. your intercourse was far away from this period. also, you are not having any feel of the pregnancy too. furthermore, you are on the pills regularly. so you are not forming eggs. therefore, most probably you are not pregnant. the delay in your menstruation may be due to change and irregularity in the composition of the pills. progesterone only pills are known to cause less bleeding. delay by two days should not be considered as delay. still to confirm the diagnosis, please wait for 1 week more and then perform urine pregnancy test on the overnight morning first urine sample. earlier these tests may give false negative results. if you do not want to wait that long, you may go for beta chat doctor test which gives reliable results even few days before missing period. this should take away your stress. and finally, even if the pills have failed (which is very rare) and you are pregnant, you can terminate the pregnancy safely by medicines up to 9 weeks. i hope this helps you."

"hi a am having very sharp pain in my right side and in back it hurts when i touch it or just breathing , it started 3 days ago , it direct hurt at all yesterday i drank lot last night and woke up with the pain the same pain as before so do think its drinking related ?",1,91109,". i read your question carefully, and i understand your concern. from the information you gave, the first thing i suspect is muscle strain. the suspicion for this condition is even higher after you have done examination, even a ct scan. regarding the amoxicillin therapy, it is an antibiotic and i can't find a reason for taking that, but for sure the doctor that prescribed it had a reason for that. i do have some questions though. is the pain localized in you abdomen or between the lower ribs in your right side. the pain is steady, or it begins or worsens with movement? do you have any swelling or bruising? is it tender when you touch it? if it is more localized between your ribs, it gets worse with movements or sneezing or deep breathing, it might be tender when you touch it than probably it is just muscle strain (as i said you excluded major conditions with examination. besides this, the condition how it started (stretching too much to get something) and an acute onset, all lead to muscle strain. in general, muscle sprain can be treated with rice therapy - rest, ice application, compress and exercise. to alleviate the pain you could take pain medication like ibuprofen or naproxen. it is necessary to limit the movement of the torso (rest, but just the firs days). gentle stretching exercises can help strengthen the muscles. pain can be alleviated applying an ice pack for 15-20 minutes 2-3 times a day (ice should not be in direct contact with the skin). for a full recovery it can take 4-6 weeks. feel free for additional questions. i hope the answer helped you. best regards"

"hi there my partner has just left hospital after having a subarachniod haemorrhage from a burst blood vein , he was also diagnosed with 2 very small aneurysms however these are not treatable due to the size of them . we get married in october and was planning on going away for a honeymoon will he be able to fly ? ? ?",1,16493,"hello, unfortunately, there are no standard guidelines that have been developed yet that we can appeal to on the question of safe to fly after aneurysm burst and/or the presence of sunburst aneurysms. the literature certainly does contain a number of citations and reports of individuals who have suffered from incidents such as spontaneous subarachnoid bleeding or rupture of sunburst aneurysms who have just completed flights. it is unclear though on any standard of practice. the majority of the recommendations seem to point to a waiting period (without well tested or grounded data) of no less than 2-4 weeks in the case of someone who just had a bleed in order to fly vs. up to 6 weeks of waiting in someone's who had a craniectomy to evacuate a blood clot who wants to fly. if it were my patient i would likely ask them to wait 4 weeks if possible to fly after a bleed. 8 weeks after a surgical procedure to evacuate any blood from the head. as far as the risk of flying with unruptured aneurysms there are no agreed-upon numbers therefore, in my opinion whether someone knows or doesn't know they have an unruptured aneurysm in their head (or any other organ of the body) it doesn't alter the risk factor (if there is even one to actually talk about) element so to me there should logically be no time constraint on when a person could or should fly after finding out they have aneurysms which are inoperable, etc. that needs to be more an individuals feeling of comfort zone action as opposed to a doctor trying to counsel them according to scientific evidence that it is or isn't safe because there's nothing along those lines. make sense? hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further. take care chat doctor."

"the first day of my last normal period was august 14 , 2011 ; a recently had sexual intercourse on september 17 , 2011 , we didst use a condom and he didst pull out . a still haven had my period for this month . would i of gotten pregnant from having intercourse ?",1,100885,"hallow madam, i hope i can be of help to you today. the due date of delivery (dd) is calculated by a formula dd= last menstrual period date (lmp) + 9 months + 7 days. since you had your lmp on 10 july 2010, the dd would be on 17 april 2011. if dd provided to you is by ultrasonography, a variation of one week is acceptable as ultrasonography calculated dd is by the size of the baby and is calculated from the date of conception. to calculate the date of egg release (ovulation), it happens 14 days before the next expected menses. so considering your menstrual cycle of 30 or 31 days, next menses would be on 10 august and ovulation would be on 28 july 2010. the life of an egg is 24 hours and the sperms are active for 72 hours. hence, a period of one week around the ovulation is fertile period. so your fertile period would be 24 july to 1 august. thus, the conception would be in that period. now in this calculation, you have to make some modifications depending on the periodicity of your menstrual cycle. then you can locate your fertile period of that cycle. thus, the intercourse(s) during this fertile period are likely to cause the pregnancy. if you had a solitary intercourse during fertile period, that day or within 4 days of that day would be the day of conception. of course this all is based on the clinical calculations. if you want to ascertain the paternity of your child for any legal cause, you may go for dna test which would be a foolproof evidence. i hope this helps you."

a was put on florid this month for luteal phase defect days 3-7 . a have been charting my but and had a significant drop on cd 13 and a spike on cd 14 and then it dropped a little for two days in a row and then spiked up much higher and has remained at the higher temperatures for the past 11 days . is that normal ? before closed a would have a drop and then a spike that stayed up for about 9 days and then would drop the day a started . a have 28-30 day cycles . a took a hot this morning and received a negative . not sure which day a ovulated .,1,52747,"hello, and i hope i can clarify this for you. you are absolutely correct in the fact that the length of your cycle is related to when you ovulate... and your ovulation date is 14 days back from when you got your period, rather than counting 14 days from the start of your period. it is typical for most women to have a 14-day luteal phase, as you suggested. you absolutely may ovulate later in your cycle. i do not know how long you and your partner have tried to conceive before trying closed. i would not recommend trying closed at all unless you have tried for a year (meaning unprotected sex at least 2-3 times per week) and not become pregnant. a reproductive endocrinologist is an appropriate referral if you have a history of infertility for one year, and if you fail at least 3 cycles of closed. they can prescribe closed and combine it with intrauterine insemination, which can increase the success rate. even though you may have had a child together before, there can be an issue with the male partner too, and it would be advisable he gets his sperm count evaluated. but you can still have conceived this cycle if you ovulated on the closed, and continued to have unprotected sex at least a week after your ovulation kit showed positive. your progesterone level pre-ovulation is not relevant at all. so- if you don't get a period by day 35 or so, do a pregnancy test. and if you didn't conceive this cycle, a reproductive endocrinologist might be a better choice to manage your closed. i hope this answered your question, and best of luck in getting pregnant. take care,"

"hello , a suffer from intermittent stomach pain and the diagnosis revealed gall stones of 2 my in size in a sludge in the gall bladder . doctor suggests gall bladder removal for the same . is it good to get the gall bladder removed ? will it affect me in any other ways . a am just 27 years old .",3,62052,"hello, how are you? stones in the gall bladder are a fairly common finding during ultrasound of the abdomen. you do not need any additional tests to confirm the presence of gall stones. but not all gall stones need treatment. in most cases, the stones do not cause any symptoms to the patient. it is especially true if there is a single stone. in some cases, when there is a small stone, it can spontaneously get expelled from the gall bladder. it is usually accompanied by pain and occasionally jaundice. the main danger of gall stones is when the stone blocks any of the ducts (tubes) chat doctor. the stone can get stuck at the opening of the gall bladder (cystic duct) or in the main bile duct (especially at the lower end where it is joined by the pancreatic duct, and together they open into the intestine). it causes bile to back up and will cause pain in the abdomen and vomiting, fever and jaundice. this scenario is more common when the stone is small enough to pass through the gall bladder opening, but for some reason gets stuck in the bile duct. it will need an ercp to extract the stone. it is much more common when the gall bladder has multiple small stones. in 99% of the cases, the treatment is accomplished by laparoscopic cholecystectomy (removal of gall bladder by making three small cuts on the abdomen, guiding the surgery through a small camera inserted). it is a fairly routine surgery and could be done at most hospitals safely. unfortunately, there are no medical therapies available once the stones have already formed. in your wives case, there are multiple small stones. since you are apprehensive about surgery, i could suggest a wait and watch policy with a very low threshold for operation, meaning i would get the gall bladder removed at the earliest and the mildest of symptoms. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

(as you said he has difficulty in walking now). you can also say to his parents that --- they can continue with all religious customs along with medicines, may be then they will agree... with medicine, he will start showing improvement in few days only... it is psychosis and patients will not agree to go to any doctor willingly, so you might need to take him forcefully. this is well accepted as it is for his benefit only. even if he doesn't agree for oral medicine there are injectables which are given to such patients... take the right step, take him to a doctor. hope the reply is useful feel free to ask more questions"
hi my name is ron.my wife has been diagnosed with stage a cirrosis.she has been drinking for a long time.she had a job about a couple of years ago that she was having an allergic reaction to the sanitizer they were using.she would take a lot of benadryl a day for years.could this with moderate drinking have caused this ?,1,108892,"dear patient, from what i have read, i understand that you are going through a very difficult situation which needs to be handled with caution. you swear to god that you have not cheated on her, but she does not believe you. now, chlamydia is a bug that in many cases in male patients is associated with an asymptomatic infection. this means that you may have gotten the infection by a prior sexual relationship, 8 years ago, and the infection has been asleep and has not shown any symptom. this happens in about 80-90% of infected male patients. the other issue is the negativity of your wife toward the bug. if you have had the infection for so long, then she may think why hasn't she encountered the bug and gotten infected as well. i can only assume that the infection was so weak that it didn't show symptoms for 8 years, and it could not be spread to your wife. this is the only possible explanation, and this can happen. please try to calm your wife, and show your steadfast love and your desire to stay together. i hope my answer helps, manoku eni, m.d."

"pm 36 weeks & 4 days pregnant for the past 2 days ave been losing brown mucus discharge , its more dark brown/ black today , a went hospital last night & they checked baby & sent me home again , shall a go again as its a lot darker today would be grateful for your answer",1,16737,"hallow dear, brown vaginal bleeding is old bleeding which remains inside for few days and then comes out. when it is of substantial amount, we suspect risk to the life of the baby. however, the bleeding was trivial and after such bleeding, you have been examined in the hospital and sent home with assurance. so no need to worry about the baby. it is likely that the mouth of the uterus (cervix) has started preparing for the delivery by getting gradually merged into the uterine walls. this process known as effacement of the cervix causes dislodgement of the mucous plug in the cervical canal with some bleeding. when such blood stained mucous come out immediately, it is red, however if it remains inside the vagina (due to very little amount or position) or cervix, the blood and thus the discharge becomes brown. however, 36 weeks is too early for starting labor process. so i would advise you to have complete rest in the house in a view to postpone the starting of labor pains as far as possible, at least for one week more. it would be good practice to monitor the well-being of the baby by listening to heart sounds (if you can do that) and/or counting the movements of the baby by clock. in left side position lying, in two hours, 10 movements are perceivable. if you note fetal movements getting affected, please report to the obstetrician asap. i hope this helps you."

"a have two skin tags on the left hand side of my penis , at the very tip of the foreskin ! a have been with one sexual partner for a year so would be very surprised if it a an std but was told from a friend genital warts could take up to two years before visible ? also our sexual life does get rough so there is a potential chance of skin being damage but nothing a have noticed",1,70876,"dear service urethane you for writing to chat doctor. i have gone through your question and understood your query regarding size of your penis. dear friend, the concern regarding penile size is very common especially among young men. the width and length of erect penis vary greatly from one individual to another. your concern to increase the size of penis is seeming unrealistic. large penis gives better sexual satisfaction to partner is a very common myth. the fact is that the size of penis has no relationship with sexual satisfaction of the partner. the lack of knowledge causes fear and apprehension. another fact is that only outer one third and the front wall of vagina have nerve fibers and hence sensitive to stimulation and contact by penis. rest of inner two third vaginae is largely insensitive. so if you want to arouse your partner during sex, you should focus on the areas of maximum nerve endings hence clitoris and inner lips or labia minor, the outer wall and outer two third of vagina. now you can understand that female sexual gratification, the size of erect penis could be anything from two inches or more! (your is six)you remember that what important is strength and not the length! entry and to and fro continuous movements are adequate. it is men technique, not his penis size that characterizes the lover in him. avoid these unrealistic expectations and be happy. i hope this will help you. if you have any further questions i will be happy to help. wish you good health."

"actually i am 54 yrs old and and i am feeling some pain in left shoulder and when i go to doctor he told me to do some tests like ecg , tmt and holder monitoring all the results are god but avg bpm was 46 ....... is that condition where i have to go for the pacemaker",1,106085,thanks for your question on chat doctor. in my opinion you should get done holder monitoring. holder monitoring is continuous ecg recording throughout the day (24 hours of recording). you may have angina. so at the time-out chest pain you may have ecg and when you reach to the hospital by that time pain subsided and ecg comes normal. so holder monitoring can pick up ecg finding at the onset of pain. you can also go for angiography to rule out coronary artery narrowing. it is the best gold standard test to rule out coronary artery disease. so if possible consult cardiologist and discuss all these.

a was training mma last night and a guy did a submission on me called heel hook . int experience any pain and continued to train for maybe an or after that . last forward to night time i wake up and go to get drink and can barely walk . men i go to straighten my leg in getting lot of pain on the inner part of my knee . that could this be pulled muscles or tendons ?,1,46548,"dear patient, i do not think that the pain in the middle of the night is related to the event of the last night. keeping the urine for 20 minutes normally should not produce extreme pain big enough to wake you up during sleeping. of course that having strained the muscle may give you pain, and maybe you strained the muscle during holding the urine. what i suggest is to wait for 2 more days. if you experience again the pain, or other symptoms please go and make the urine and blood analysis, to check for prostatitis, urethritis or any infection of the lower urinary tract. kidney stones may give you pain also, but they are after localized in the back, lumbar region.meanwhile, i would suggest you chat doctor. please feel free to write me anytime, and thank you for choosing chat doctor. all the best,"

"by husband was rushed last night to the of for severe stomach pains on his upper abdominal area . the doctors were able to rule out appendicitis . he was given a few antacids and was released when the pain subsided . today , the stomach pains are back and he is getting chills , but with no fever . he does not have diarrhoea and no nausea , but he said he feels flu like symptoms without the diarrhoea . are these symptoms of either gal stones or peptic ulcer ? how do we narrow it down and what to do from here ?",1,44716,"hello vivek, thank you for posting your question. the clinical diagnosis of any fever is based on a few principles. firmly we inquire about the associated symptoms the child had with fever. apart from that the extent and pattern of fever, whether it was associated with chills or came at any particular time of the day etc. these details would help us know what would probably have caused the fever and based on that investigations are usually ordered. in case of atv, as you informed he was initially treated for a stomach infection, then for pneumonia and finally for urinary tract infection. in such a situation you have two possibilities. either he had 3 different kinds of infection which presented with fever over 2 months, in which case his fever should have subsided each time with the medication, he should have felt better and then again fallen sick with a new infection. if that is not the case then his fever could probably be attributed to a single cause, with the other two being misdiagnoses. in such cases investigations could give support and clue as to what the exact cause of fever is. mucosal irregularities in urinary bladder is a very non-specific finding and the diagnosis of a urinary tract infection should never solely be based on that. associated symptoms of pain or difficulty in urination along with a positive urine culture is required for diagnosis. if you could provide any more information regarding what his urine culture report was, or what his associated symptoms were, then it would be much easier for me to provide you any further guidance."

"i . sometimes my heart feels like it is getting squeezed , and the my chest tightens up and my left arm feels reply heavy . a do not have any burning sensation in my stomach , my stomach- as far as i know- has nothing to do with this . a would appreciate help soon because i am worried about this",1,40260,dear friend generally back does not cause stomach pain. so i am trying to deal with your problem picking one problem then another.first the most common cause of back problem is muscle spasm in and around vertebral column. excessive or overuse of these muscles in the form of lifting weight or bending forwards causes back pain. so what you have to do is give rest to your muscles and do some back strengthening exercise like flexion exercise of back region. and as far as stomach pain and burning sensation is concerned it can be due to excessive acid secretion in the stomach. so regular intake of sanitizing can give you relief from this nagging pain.i hope in this way you can solve your health problems.my best wishes.thank you.

"by nine year old daughter has painful , swollen gums ( a nodule ) right behind her two top front teeth - over the past few months this nodule comes and goes , usually lasting about a week . a want to know what causes it and what can be done to prevent it from returning .",1,74894,"hi, thanks for writing in. it is important to follow up the nodule in the lung. the size is important and if it is less than 8 mm then there is no serious concern. should the nodule be closer to 3 cm in diameter then the probability of cancer is higher. what i intend to say is that a nodule must be followed up for a year or more depending on its doubling time. this is the time taken by the nodule to become twice its volume. a nodule that becomes twice its volume within 30 days or more than 6 months is most likely benign. less than 30 days doubling is likely to be due to an infection. rarely there are nodules due to bronchoalveolar cancer that might double over 2 years. therefore, follow up is essential when there is a lung nodule."

"i take migrogynon as contraception , this month instead of having my 7 pill free days i started the next pack of pills . i am now 8days in to the pack , had a slight post coital bleed . automatically you panic so have taken the self - swab chlamydia test , just wondering if the bleed could be due to starting a new pack and skipping a period . i haven missed any pills however i did take one late ( i would usually take at about 6am however took in the evening )",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

i am suffering from bronchitis due to which there was a time i use to take inhaler lot at that time my doctor said that their no permanent cure for this and i have to continue to stalin inhaler .i have allergic bronchitis like from dust of pollution of time of cutting of wheat in fields .in suffer period i use to have respiratory problem like heavy breathing and my stomach is like filled as i feel heavy on cheats ... but after i consult to another doctor he give me advice to start forecourt capsule to inhale ...... which work to my last condition as its one year i am taking same medicine regularly but i want to know this is some course or it is going to my dependency to medicine,1,17289,"hello welcome to chat doctor. i have read your question and understand your concerns. the treatment regimen prescribed to you is ideal in the treatment of asthma, but the dosage may be adjusted and if you have no further episodes of asthma your doctor can gradually omit this inhaler, and then you can use as a when required. weigh gain is due to fluticasone component which is a steroid. my advice to you is - 1. ask your doctor to make the least possible dose of fluticasone component in your inhaler then you continue for 2-3 months with the same component twice or thrice weekly. once you noticed no episodes occur during that period gradually that combination or simple stalin can be given as a when required. 2. as you are steroid dependent now it will take time actually to taper the dose. 3. if you have seasonal asthma then you can start inhaler one month prior to season regularly. 4. regular breathing exercise and yoga will help to reduce the incidence of acute attacks. thank you. have a nice day."

when a wake in the morning a have a terrible pain in my lungs . a can only describe them as feeling deflated . a have to take short breathes and start increasing the length of the breaths until my lungs slowing start to inflate . of a breath in too deep at first the pain is terrible,1,15046,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. feeling short of breath is not unusual while you're pregnant because the hormones of pregnancy actually have a way of telling your brain to breathe faster. this is to ensure that your baby gets enough oxygen, because as your belly gets bigger your lungs are not able to expand as well. so many women feel the sensation of needing to catch their breath all the time when they breathe when they are in the third trimester. in addition, because you would have been on bed rest for so long, you probably are not in very good cardiovascular shape. another possible reason why you could be feeling short of breath is that there is a possibility that you are anemic. normally, as part of routine prenatal care we check your blood count as well is a test for gestational diabetes somewhere between 24 and 28 weeks. if you've not yet had this test, it might be a good idea to mention your symptoms to your doctor. of course, there can be some serious, dangerous things that can cause shortness of breath; like blood clots that spread to your lung, or fluid in the lungs and other pulmonary problems. if you experience any chest pain or severe shortness of breath or start developing a productive cough, you should notify your doctor immediately and possibly go to the hospital for evaluation. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

a am suffering with burning mouth syndrome . tonight a have noticed that there a swollen bumps under my tongue and also in the back of my throat . a am very concerned about the swelling . should a be ?,1,95823,"hi sir/madam, swollen tongue can be easily treated by the help of ayurveda. let me advise you about tongue swelling. swollen tongue is actually an abnormal condition in the tongue occurring due to tongue inflammation, where either a part or the entire tongue gets enlarged, and fatter than the normal tongue size. it is true that tongue in its swelling conditions is taken as a kind of defense mechanism which helps in fighting against the infection and aids in healing. however, when there is an excessive swelling for longer time; the swollen tongue can be actually very much harmful. it must be mentioned that tongue inflammation or the swollen tongue condition can result from the excessive fluid accumulation in the tongue tissues and termed as angioedema. this swollen tongue can also occur due to excess deposit of abnormal substances like the amyloid protein and also can be result from any kind of allergic reactions to certain medicines. symptoms of swollen tongue:-1. enlarged, puffy tongue due to excessive swelling2. difficulty breathing when tongue swelling outgrows to the throat or the air passage.3. discoloration or redness seen sometimes due to inflammationproblem while swallowing foods. causes of swollen tongue:-1. tongue sores usually caused due to virus.2. strep infections can cause swollen tongue.3. sometimes burning of tongue while eating food in hot conditions can lead to the trauma and swollen tongue.4. vitamin d deficiency can also lead to swollen tongue and other tongue inflammation.5. certain allergic reactions can cause swelling in tongue.6. patients suffering from genetic disorders like downs syn chat doctor. 7. tongue cancer, leukemia etc. causes swollen tongue.8. breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue or rhabdomyolysis can cause swollen tongue.9. hypothyroidism, amyloidosis etc. can also lead to tongue swelling.10. excessive alcoholism and smoking also causes swollen tongue. next i am going to tell about the home remedies you should follow:-1. take enough of butter, soups, yogurt, gravy and broths in regular diet. in fact try to switch on the semi-solid foods which help in providing relaxation in swollen tongue condition.2. cold temperature helps in reducing the tongue swelling. so keep some ice cubes in your mouth and relax yourself.3. include celery sticks in diet and provide enough relief to your swollen tongue.4. make a dilute solution of turmeric in a warm glass of water and gargle with the solution to get relief from tongue inflammation and swollen tongue.5."

"hello doc , be just returned from a long trip that required us to travel to 3-4 different cities in india . like all of us , my 2.5 year old daughter had 3-4 loose motions in the last couple of days . the is as active as she used to be . however , her appetite has reduced to almost half of what it used to be . the wont even touch her cup of milk . the only thing she eats without a fuss is oranges , which a let her have as much as she wants . a am really worried she will turn weak if this carries on . is this normal ? should a give her time and not force food on her ?",1,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

(regular use of emergency pill is harmful)conception occurs if she was in 10th to 18th day of her cycle(in a regular cycle of 28 day duration). you can ask her at what day she is in and wait for next cycle to occur. if it delayed by 7 days then get done upt to diagnose if pregnant and then the required treatment can be taken. regards"

ave recently been diagnosed with melanoma which has spread to a lymph node in my neck . by doctor wants to now remove all the nodes but says there is no need for chemo . they also found a spot on my lung which they say is too small to biopsy.i would think it would be better to do some chemo ?,1,831,"hi, thanks for writing in. it appears that your son has a melanoma that might have spread to neck lymph nodes. this is a possibility and has to be confirmed by doing a biopsy. what happens is that lymph nodes are found in many regions of the body and are small unless they are stimulated by disease process. when there is a disease in a person then the lymph nodes of a particular region get enlarged and this is a reaction by the immune mechanism. since your son has been told that he has a melanoma, it has probably involved the neck lymph nodes. the lymph nodes in the neck are close to the carotid artery and internal jugular vein, and it is possible that the lymph nodes have wrapped around these. doing a surgery in this condition is not possible and radiation usually works. it is suggested that you spend some time with your son by going over to his place and know more about the treatment he should be taking for his condition. please do not worry."

(there's nothing much you can do to avoid, but just be vigilant to identify things early).2. get regular usg to make sure the left kidney is fine.3. it is possible for the right kidney function to reduce further as the child grows. this is because the left kidney will grow normally while your right won't. most of the time, the left kidney will enlarge and take up the extra-work. just monitor his bp and if it goes out of range, get him treated."

hello dr. in the 21may of this year i had some heart palpitations . a was admitted in the hospital for a week . coz i had vomited a worm earlier the or treated me for bilhazia.wen went for a heart echo dey said i have premature heart contractions . a did another which said one of my mitral valves was fibrotic . the problem a have now is that my left leg feels numb wen a walk and my left hand at times is week.i have chest pains and left side of my face gets a bit numb . a was put on aternolol .,1,34243,"dear, first, please understand that pulmonary stenosis is basically the tightness of one of the valves on the right side of the heart and in your daughters case, it seems to be by birth. you have mentioned that she underwent cardiac cat hat the age of 1, but you did not mention that only the path study was done and what was the gradient at that time or the ballooning was also done. now she is 7 years old, and she never had any symptoms as per you (i presume she never had palpitations, loss of consciousness, chest pain, swelling feet or face, easy navigability), so i would just do echo to look for the gradient across the pulmonary valve and then decide if the cardiac cat his required or not. now coming to your worry about the leakage in the valve. a tight valve is rigid and it doesn't close properly sometimes leading to leakage which can sometimes become worrisome and needs surgery. and ballooning of the tight valve can also lead to some leakage in the valve and this ballooning is done only if there is no leakage initially. i hope i have cleared your queries to some extent!! all the best"
