( depends on what they need to do in this new situation .. a hope it a not too costly with my insurance .. so a can focus on other a little on the other area ),2,44715,"hello, i can understand your concern. it would have been helpful if you had mentioned which tooth was treated for root canal. as you are mentioning that the tooth was black and had cracks in it, i am assuming that the tooth is in the lower front region, and you had had some trauma to the lower jaw area which made the tooth dead and also hurt the chin and lip. other possibility is that if the tooth was dead for many years, it may have developed a periapical cyst in relation with the tooth which might be pressing on the mental nerve supplying lower lip and chin and may cause numbness of those areas. alternatively, the numbness may have started after taking local anesthesia in the lower front area for some tooth problem and the injection might have been given deep. in any case, it seems that the nerve supplying sensation to the lower front area of jaw along with lower lip and chin (mental nerve) is damaged. usually, if the nerve is damaged, it can regenerate in 3-6 months and the sensations can return. if you are not sure regarding the crown on the tooth, you can avoid it for some months and take care not to bite hard things with that tooth so that it does not fracture. you can get the crown after the numbness is solved. i would also advise you to visit an oral and maxillofacial surgeon for the examination of the area and regarding numbness. he/she might take an x-ray to rule out presence of periapical lesion or cyst in relation with the tooth. crown should surely be postponed until this possibility is ruled out. i hope this information helps you. thank you for choosing chat doctor. i wish you feel better soon. best,"

"i via , by doc has prescribed primolut for 10 days and then to follow by taking closed day 5 of my period ! a am approx day 13 into my current cycle . by question is i am been having unprotected intercourse ( trying to conceive ) and i am now having a stretchy discharge ... i think am ovulating ? by worry is will the primolut prevent fertilation/ implantation if i was to start primolut ?",1,43041,"hi, progesterone is a female sex hormone produced by the corpus luteum in the ovary following ovulation each month. it helps thicken the lining of the uterus to prepare for a fertilized egg and thus maintain the menstrual cycle and early stages of pregnancy. primolut-n (norethisterone) is a synthetic and potent progesterone hormone that stops uterine bleeding. at the time before a period, the level of progesterone falls and this causes the lining of the uterus to be shed as menstrual period. by taking primolut-n tablets the levels of progesterone are kept artificially high, and so the period does not start and the period gets delayed. primolut-n is also helpful in inducing (starting) the period by taking it at particular days throughout the cycle. period will start two or three days after you stop taking the chat doctor. so, it mimics like the natural female sex hormone progesterone and manipulates or modifies its action as explained above. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further. take care"

i had taken an emergency contraceptive pill twice a month . since then the side effects like abdomen pain was observed . its unable for me to bear the pain . i have been taking painkiller everyday since the pain has seen . it gives me relief then . should i continue ? or may i get a better solution ? thank you,1,23871,"hi, i can understand your problem and i appreciate that you have reached us in time. althea is a birth control pill that is taken in 21 day cycle. it gives protection against pregnancy if you have unprotected sexual intercourse while already taking the pills regularly. in your case, you will not get protection from althea. you need to take an emergency contraceptive pill (i pill, plan b etc.). these pills are available over the counter in all medical stores. you just have to take this one pill preferably within 24 hours of unprotected intercourse. make sure you take it within 72 hours by latest as it may not have any effect after 72 hours. the sooner the pill is taken, the more the protection. i would advise you not to make these pills a routine as they may have severe side effects. make sure you do not take it more than twice in a month. use other contraceptive methods like condoms for future birth control. i hope this information helps. thank you for choosing chat doctor. take care. best,"

a have this lump in my leg near my groin . it comes and goes and sometimes hurts . its been there for about a year and a half . it sometimes looks like the skin on top of the lump is bruised . the doctor said it could be a cyst or a lymphnode but it is down farther than lymphnodes usually are . a am nervous its some sort of lymphoma ? what do you think ?,1,21962,"dear simone, there is one rule for doctors here in croatia: when you think too much, stop, and think again, but this time think for the simplest diagnose. if you have pain in abdomen and an umbilical hernia seen on us then the first thing to think about is ""abdominal pain caused by hernia"":). there are many conditions in medicine where pain doesn't need to beau localized near the ""pathology"". sometimes pain can be felt on the opposite side of the affected organ. it is known that one of common symptom of myocardial infarction is pain in the left shoulder. also, infection of the abdominal organs can give many types and localizations of pain. the reason for it is simple: when i see pain, i see nerves, not organs (this is my own phrase:)). nerves conduct pain, and nerves are all around, going from periphery to the brain, so pain can be localized on its pathway, so just let's go back to your problem. doctor should tell you the size of hernia and its content which can be only preperitoneal tissue, momentum or even intestines. this dark triangle...mmm.it can be nothing and everything. i usually don't trust our ultrasonographer because they are strange people... sometimes they don't see what they need to see, or they see what they don't need to see. all i see is that us is operator-dependent diagnostic test... but we shouldn't underestimate this finding. it can be uterine moma, endometriosis, cyst or tumor. and yes, it can cause pain you're describing. so what you need to do: 1. ct scan of pelvic and abdominal region. why? as i said, these us findings are always doubtful, ct is a high sensitive test which will find the exact problem for sure. it will tell you the size and severity of hernia and the morphology of this uterine lesion. it can also find some other problems in its early phase."

"hello . a was playing basketball and a went up for a rebound , as a was coming down my friend jumped up to get the ball as well and hit my toot upwards . causing me to bite into my lip and hurt my front tooth at the same time . my lip seems better now but my tooth feels numb , however i do not feel that much pain when moving it or putting pressure on it . does this mean i have nerve or root damage . if so will i need a root canal , and is there a possibility of losing my tooth ?",1,44715,"hello, i can understand your concern. it would have been helpful if you had mentioned which tooth was treated for root canal. as you are mentioning that the tooth was black and had cracks in it, i am assuming that the tooth is in the lower front region, and you had had some trauma to the lower jaw area which made the tooth dead and also hurt the chin and lip. other possibility is that if the tooth was dead for many years, it may have developed a periapical cyst in relation with the tooth which might be pressing on the mental nerve supplying lower lip and chin and may cause numbness of those areas. alternatively, the numbness may have started after taking local anesthesia in the lower front area for some tooth problem and the injection might have been given deep. in any case, it seems that the nerve supplying sensation to the lower front area of jaw along with lower lip and chin (mental nerve) is damaged. usually, if the nerve is damaged, it can regenerate in 3-6 months and the sensations can return. if you are not sure regarding the crown on the tooth, you can avoid it for some months and take care not to bite hard things with that tooth so that it does not fracture. you can get the crown after the numbness is solved. i would also advise you to visit an oral and maxillofacial surgeon for the examination of the area and regarding numbness. he/she might take an x-ray to rule out presence of periapical lesion or cyst in relation with the tooth. crown should surely be postponed until this possibility is ruled out. i hope this information helps you. thank you for choosing chat doctor. i wish you feel better soon. best,"

hi live been having this weird pain in my chest i went of the doctors and they showed me the ray of a * air * bubble in my chest and it hurts my chest when in stressed and at random times .. and for each event i have to breath through it or calmly for it to go away ... what is this ?,1,87733,"hello, i read your message and understood your medical issue. i see that you have a persistent chat doctor. i don't know what you have used to treat it, but this is quite a long period of time for the symptom to be self-limited even if left without any treatment. when laughing, much more pressure develops inside the pulmonary system which makes the obstruction of the airways to become more evident. chest discomfort and the sense of pressure in the chest followed by a more severe cough especially after a physical efforts are signs that show that the pulmonary function is getting down. it can be due to pneumonia of course or as a side effect of the previous pneumonia episodes. in this case, the pulmonary function is reduced because of atelectasis which is the substitution of the pulmonary tissue with fibrous tissue. anyway, i do not think that this is your case even though i do not expel it as a differential diagnosis. what i think is a possibility of herd (gastroesophageal reflux disease) which has not been treated adequately and might have caused aspiration pneumonia. anyway further tests are needed to rule it out and treat it adequately like chest x-ray, upper endoscopy and a good physical examination. bronchitis may become chronic and may lead to more severe pulmonary disease like copd. my suggestion is that you must see your doctor and do the respiratory tests to evaluate the function of your lungs. chest x-ray is very important in this case. it can be due to an allergic reaction as well. maybe you are constantly exposed to the allergic substance that causes obstruction to the airway and produces the symptoms. mediastinum organs like large vessels, trachea, lymph nodes etc. must be evaluated. tumors in this region, also the pulmonary tumors are not usual and if found they are successfully treated. my advice is that you must do at least the pulmonary tests, a chest x-ray and all the random laboratory examinations and if you can do the allergic tests. hope this is helpful for you."

"a have found a round moveable lump the size of a large pea near the nipple . a have also had the arena coil fitted about 7 weeks ago . the lump is not painful , but i have been experiencing low level soreness/pain around the breast . a am seeing the doctor today but am quite worried . a am 34 and have had two children . no history of breast cancer",1,82366,"hello friend, thank you for posting your query through chat doctor. i am a homeopath answering your query and the answer which i am going to give you may contain several thoughts which may appear strange or new for you. this i say because homeopathy is a new system of medicine and is almost unheard by the majority of the population. therefore, due to the high influence of the conventional medicine the people at large are brainwashed to believe and act according to the health education given by them. coming back to the fibroadenoma of your left breast in the year 1979, you had a psychological conflict in the mind level. you are a sensitive individual and that is why your left breast was affected. it must have been related with your child chat doctor. the sensitivity is genetic, and you reacted to the conflict through the brain according to a genetic programming. mind-brain - organ affection resulted in the development of a lump in your left breast in 1979. you consulted your gynecologist, and he suggested that it may turn to become cancerous in future and so it is better to remove it, and you subdued to his suggestion. actually the lump in the breast was an attempt of the body to cure you, or it was the result of a self defense mechanism. since you had not resolved the conflict in the psychological level, the lump remained there without getting resolved. but the body kept the lump protected in a cyst with minimum amount of inflammation called chronic cystitis. by removing the fibroadenoma or chronic cystic mastitis, you were not cured, but your lump in the breast was removed. in 1995 also you are the same person, you are the same sensitive person, and you underwent another more serious psychological conflict and the same left breast was again affected in a more serious manner. instead of recognizing the mass as a defense mechanism, you got the fear in you that you have cancer. the tissue changes also suggested that there is more serious pathology, and they labelled your lump this time as cancer and suggested removal of your left breast. if you could have recognized the lump as a defense mechanism and if you had no fear of cancer, you could have retained your breast. but the fear of cancer is such that it is associated with death and so you lost your breast. in no case, either by removal of lump in 1979 or by removal of your breast in 1995, you are not cured only your disease is cured. hope by this time you have got the answer for your query. both are related to each other because they are in the same individual, same sensitivity, same program. homeopathy cures the person and once the individual is cured all his diseases will be cured. with best wishes,"

am married since one year i have endometriosis cyst in left ovary . wat a a chances for pregnancy . wat type of treatment should i undergo . are there any specific food which should be avoided during pregnancy planning . am anxious to conceive but its always been unsuccessful . the rupture of follicles are healthy in the other ovary .. please advice,1,29760,"hi, and thanks for posting your query. welcome to chat doctor. i read your question completely and have understood it well. i am sorry to know your problem, but i am sure you will conceive normally. furthermore, i being a surgeon have seen many such cases and most of them, like more than 90 percent of the times you should conceive normally without any help. but i need some more information. what has been removed in the right ovary? cyst or ovary itself!!?? both are potential possibilities. but don't worry i will answer both sides 1. if only cyst has been removed, then superb. you have almost no change in rate of conception. 2. in case right ovary itself is removed. even then i suggest you not to worry. definitely there's little reduction in rates of pregnancy but not that you won't be able to conceive. its simple, with one kidney people can survive with one testis, semen will be totally normal and hence, with one ovary you'll be fine. hope ive cleared your doubts, in case you need any other information, please let me know. take care and god bless."

"i , when lynn on my stomach just before after playing a round of golf , i got 3 heart pupatations within 5 minutes , almost like gas in my stomach but it happens then i feel my heart beats harder after each one then settles down . happens more lying on my stomach , is this normal",1,107260,hellothanks for posting here. first the heart beat missing thing may be something just subjective which you feel. hyperacidity and gas problems in the stomach may occasionally cause such symptoms like skipping heart beat sensation. second possibility is you really have missed beats. missed beats are present in a small percentage of normal population. they are usually harmless. missed beats occurring with some underlying heart disease need to be evaluated. since you have no cardiac history you need not worry about them. i advice you a course of antacids pantoprazole tablets 40 mg twice a day for one week then once a day for a week. just see if symptoms disappear. thank you

(as you said he has difficulty in walking now). you can also say to his parents that --- they can continue with all religious customs along with medicines, may be then they will agree... with medicine, he will start showing improvement in few days only... it is psychosis and patients will not agree to go to any doctor willingly, so you might need to take him forcefully. this is well accepted as it is for his benefit only. even if he doesn't agree for oral medicine there are injectables which are given to such patients... take the right step, take him to a doctor. hope the reply is useful feel free to ask more questions"

a tried closed one month in july and became pregnant for the first time ever at 30 . unfortunately it was an ectopic and a lost my left tube . a am now 31 and a started closed in november but didst conceive . a took it again this month and my period is due to start jan 3rd but a am having slight cramping and air bubbles in my vaginal area .,1,52747,"hello, and i hope i can clarify this for you. you are absolutely correct in the fact that the length of your cycle is related to when you ovulate... and your ovulation date is 14 days back from when you got your period, rather than counting 14 days from the start of your period. it is typical for most women to have a 14-day luteal phase, as you suggested. you absolutely may ovulate later in your cycle. i do not know how long you and your partner have tried to conceive before trying closed. i would not recommend trying closed at all unless you have tried for a year (meaning unprotected sex at least 2-3 times per week) and not become pregnant. a reproductive endocrinologist is an appropriate referral if you have a history of infertility for one year, and if you fail at least 3 cycles of closed. they can prescribe closed and combine it with intrauterine insemination, which can increase the success rate. even though you may have had a child together before, there can be an issue with the male partner too, and it would be advisable he gets his sperm count evaluated. but you can still have conceived this cycle if you ovulated on the closed, and continued to have unprotected sex at least a week after your ovulation kit showed positive. your progesterone level pre-ovulation is not relevant at all. so- if you don't get a period by day 35 or so, do a pregnancy test. and if you didn't conceive this cycle, a reproductive endocrinologist might be a better choice to manage your closed. i hope this answered your question, and best of luck in getting pregnant. take care,"

"hello doctor , i am in my first month of pregnancy , and i took villa map 1 tablet , is the any side effects for this ? also , i done want to terminate my pregnancy can i stop taking that pills now and still continue my pregnancy ? i took the pills on 13th may 2012 in the evening ...",1,11806,"hello dear, i understand your concern. in my opinion the one of the side effects of birth control pills is vomiting. this can be prevented by taking pill at bedtime. antiemetics can also help. but the nausea due to pregnancy is a rare possibility. because the ejaculation was not done inside and moreover it is too early to feel any pregnancy symptoms. usually the pregnancy symptoms start 2 weeks after missed period. and the first sign of pregnancy is missed period. so just check your next period. and the vomiting mostly appear to be due to pills. consult your doctor for supportive treatment. best regards..."

(as you said he has difficulty in walking now). you can also say to his parents that --- they can continue with all religious customs along with medicines, may be then they will agree... with medicine, he will start showing improvement in few days only... it is psychosis and patients will not agree to go to any doctor willingly, so you might need to take him forcefully. this is well accepted as it is for his benefit only. even if he doesn't agree for oral medicine there are injectables which are given to such patients... take the right step, take him to a doctor. hope the reply is useful feel free to ask more questions"

"a have pain in both the sides of the chest , a kind of uncomfortable pain which stays there and increases when i bend and press my finger in the chest . it is there since 2 months . a done know which specialists to go to ? i am 33 yrs old having no medical history .",1,41649,"hello. thank you for your question and welcome to chat doctor. i understand your concern. well, i am going to try and explain the differences between various origins of the pain which can arise from the rib cage. there is angina. it is described more like mid-chest heaviness or squeezing sensation, that is triggered by exercise and relieved by rest, which radiates to the both sides of the chest, to the jaw and left arm and shoulder. it is indicative of a blockage within one or more coronary arteries and reflects the lowering of blood supply to the heart muscle. an ekg obtained in the moment of chest pain, if it fills this description, would be helpful. then there is pleuritic chest pain. this kind of pain is sharp, stabbing pain that can happen in any part of the chest area. no radiation like in anginal pain. it arises from acute or chronic inflammation of the linings that are within the rib cage: pleura (lining of the lungs) or pericardium (lining of the heart) or both. in this regard, i would recommend a chest x-ray for pleural inflammation or effusion. in case of pericardial pain and anginal pain, echocardiogram is helpful, by evaluating the size, motility and function of heart muscle and valves, and also by assessing the pericardium and whether there is fluid build-up within it, or not. other causes of chest pain are related to the locomotion system of the rib cage: muscle soreness, bone and cartilage-related pain. in the end, stress can also cause chest pain. i hope i was helpful with my answer. best regards,"

yes i swallowed an enzyme gelatin capsule down the wrong pipe about 2 hours ago . it seems to have somewhat dissolved a bit and i was able to bring up some of the enzyme but the the capsule has not dissolved and is still in my throat . a tried coughing several times but is still stuck and it hurts to swallow . mario,1,64560,"hi, it's possible that your mothers coughing fits account to be normal, since it was a chat doctor. i would advise giving her only semisolid food that will be easy on her food pipe and her gut since she is prone to hemorrhoids. it will be easier for her to swallow and digest if the food is more soft and watery. her age is the reason her gastrointestinal tract must be narrowing, hence sometimes when swallowed too fast, food can go to the wrong pipe(viz air pipe), causing a coughing impulse, since the epiglottis is sensitive, and it responds to touch by a cough impulse. hence, i would say it is nothing to worry about, when she gets this coughing spell out her in a position where she can cough out everything she swallowed since it is necessary to avoid aspirating food. after the spell, and only after the spell has subsided, and she has thrown out all food, and she is in her senses, give her a glass of water that she can slowly sip n swallow, which will ease the healing. take care. good to know you care for your mother."

i had my period on 27th may ... me and my of had oral sex on 5th june .. he dint ejaculate inside me .. for precautionary measure i took i pill .. i had light bleeding from june 7th to june 9th .. i again used i pill on 22 june and my of dint ejaculate inside me ... i took it as i was afraid of precut .. i did not even have light bleeding like last time .. and my period is two days late ... i am scared of pregnancy ... how can i know if i am pregnant .. which is the correct test to know ..,1,55615,"hallow dear, if you had your period on june 30, you will not get urine pregnancy test positive on july 20 even if you had conceived. these tests give reliable results only 8-10 days after the missed period. the brown discharge you had could be mittelschmerz - spotting at the time of egg release. you had menses on june 30 - 4 days after the intercourse. so there is no possibility of pregnancy from the intercourse on june 26. if you had any intercourse around middle of july, there is a possibility of conception. even if he has not ejaculated inside the vagina, there is always a possibility of pre-cum being deposited unknowingly inside the vagina. pre-cum do contain sperms which can fertilize the egg. this pregnancy can be detected by doing urine pregnancy test after august 10. if you had no intercourse after june 30, there is no possibility of pregnancy. in that case, take tab. devilry for 5 days and you will get the menses 4-7 days after. i hope this gives you directions."

i want to use removable braces in order to get my teeth straightened ... i have had fixed braces before ten years and after that i used removable ones on the suggestion and given by dentist ... i just want to know can i use the same 10 year old removable braces which are still with me ... is it hygienic enough ?,1,25822,"hi basin orgazthanks for posting your concerns you have mentioned your teeth are not in line. this condition is very common. in dental terminology we call it as crowding or maligned teeth. this condition can be definitely corrected with orthodontic treatmentdepending on the severity of the condition, your age and your oral health, there are various options available in orthodontic treatment.- the first option is to go for conventional orthodontic treatment (braces). this may take about 1-3 years depending on the severity and age. the dentist may or may not extract few of your teeth to gain space so that the front teeth can be aligned. - the second option is to ask for invitation, where there are no braces, but a series of appliances will be given to you. the appliance would be transparent and hence it would be aesthetically pleasing, nobody would get to know that you are being treated.- if the crowding is minor and if the teeth have to be moved very little to align, then the dentist may recommend removable appliance. however, there are more chances of recurrence if the condition is treated with removable appliance. hope i have answered your queries. regards"

when a was 15 a noticed a lump in my left breast . a went and got a biopsy and it was ruled as a fibrotic cyst . now 5 years later a have another lump but this time in my right breast . is this common and is is possible a may have fibrotic breast disease,1,107693,"hi, welcome to chat doctor. based on the information provided by you, the breast lump could be a fibroadenoma or fibrotic disease. fibroadenoma is benign swelling which moves freely with in the breast tissue and is usually pains and often requires no treatment. fibrotic disease is usually seen in women in their 30s and present as a painful mass which does not move freely in breast tissue. it presents as pain during menstruation (cyclical nostalgia). you have not mentioned anything about pain in the swelling during menstruation. the possibility of fibrotic disease can be ruled out as you are 22 and you don't have any pain. so, the breast lump you have is a fibroadenoma. fnac does not remove the swelling. fnac is a test where some sample of the lump is taken through the needle and tested to know what type of swelling. evian capsules contain vitamin e and you can take them without any doubt. you need no special precautions and just stop worrying. please get the fnac done and if it turns out to be fibroadenoma, you do not need any surgery. surgery in fibroadenoma is required only when the lump is too big and causes mass effects. hope you got my point. take care"

"a have had this `` place '' in my mouth on the inside gum right below tooth in the back . like an ulcer . been living with it , thinking it would go away . now that tooth hurts . went to dentist , he said not an abscess , or wisdom tooth problem , looks like a gum problem . have me antibiotics anyway , just in case it is the beginning of an abscess . a am rinsing with proxy . the tooth is a little painful when tapped . is this the beginning of an abscess do you think ?",1,98449,hi. thanks for the query. a small movable lump just below the gum line and in line with the third molar indicates infection. in case if you have an infected tooth the lump can be due to spread of the infection below the root tips of the tooth leading to formation of dental abscess by accumulation of pus. in case if there is infection in the gums due to food impaction or injury to the gums it can lead to gum boil formation. i would suggest you to consult a dentist and get a clinical evaluation done. in case of an infected wisdom tooth an x-ray will be taken to rule out if tooth can be saved or not. if it can be saved root canal treatment followed by antibiotics and painkillers can be done. in case of gum boil scaling along with antibiotics and gum paint can help. hope your query is solved. regards.

"my disabled son has been taking antibiotics for urinary infection and has developed yeast infection in his mouth . be have been treating this with an oral mouth wash prescribed by his doctor , but we are not sure he is better . be does not want to eat . that can we do to help ?",1,63570,"hello, i can understand your concern. i can think of several possibilities for the orange discoloration of tongue, gums and teeth of your father. firstly, as he is in hospital for 3 months for various diseases, it is understandable that his oral hygiene will be compromised. regular tooth brushing, flossing and gargles would have been neglected for 3 months. this may cause accumulation of food particles, debris, plaque etc. on the teeth, gums and tongue surfaces causing them to appear orange. if his oral hygiene can be improved by use of power toothbrush, mouthwash etc., this problem can be solved. secondly, as he is taking many antibiotics for a chronic period of time, and he is also suffering from fungal pneumonia, there are chances that he is having fungal/yeast growth in mouth causing orange appearance. ask the doctor if fungal pneumonia is being treated with systemic antifungal medications that can cover fungal infection of oral cavity and the growth with stop and disappear. in addition, there are some antibiotics given to treat mrsa, kidney disease and respiratory infections that have side effects of changing the normal bacterial flora of mouth and causing orange discoloration. you can ask your treating doctor about this too. i can assure you that none of these causes are too severe and should not be worried about. i hope this information helps. thank you for choosing chat doctor. let me know if you have follow-up questions. best,"

"a have recently found out that i do not ovulate naturally and i also have irregular period patterns in ... i come off my period for 1 week then have brown discharge for 1 week then i have a proper period for 1 week . this pattern has been consistent for around 6-8 months.i was previously on the contraceptive pill for 7 years which i stopped taking two years ago and have used no further contraceptives since . by doctor advised me i would have to wait a year before she would even refer me to the hospital for any fertility treatment so i ordered florid online and have taken two courses so far and haven conceived as of yet.it has made me ovulate both times on day 5-6 after my period stopped but i start the brown discharge on the 7-8th day after my period has stopped , so is it even possible for me to conceive with this happening ?",1,10535,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. pregnacare conception is simply a combination of vitamins that help a woman have a healthy pregnancy from conception. it has no hormonal effects and should not have any impact on the regularity of your cycle nor your ability to conceive, it is not unusual for women to bleed on and off for even 6 weeks after a miscarriage so the 19-day bleeding episode you had may not have actually been a menstrual period but still could have been bleeding leftover for your d and c. so you may not be ""late"" at all, but may just have not had a real period since the pregnancy. there is no reason to assume you would have problems getting pregnant again since you have conceived naturally twice in the last year. either way, the pregnancies conception vitamins have nothing to do with your irregular bleeding. it is generally advisable to wait to try to conceive again after your first real period-so i would wait until you bleed again to resume trying to conceive. if you do not get a real period by 3 months from your last bleeding episode, you should follow up for your gun for a re-evaluation of your hormones and treatment with progesterone, which can restart your period cycling. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful. best wishes,"

by son is 11 yrs old and has complained twice over the past two days of having blackened vision for short bursts of time ( 3-4 sec ) as he describes it . be also indicates he looses orientation and for split moment does not know where or why he is in the place that he is ? an you please advise me ? thank you gene calafato,1,90927,"hi, i am chat doctor. i have read your message. i think i can help you. first, the symptoms that you have described are highly suggestive of seizures. here is why- 1. they come in night-seizures are commonly triggered when the patient sleeps or just around the sleep. of course, they can occur at other times too.2. they start from the leg and move up and then spread to the rest of the body.3. the episodes last 3-4 minutes and then resolves. i assume (you have not mentioned it) that it is never remembered by him, the episode that is. i think you should both take it very seriously. there is a high possibility that there is an intracranial problem that he is having which is extending and progressing undetected in the brain just because you do not want to visit a neurologist. i think you should meet a neurologist as soon as possible and request an mri brain (with spectroscopy if needed) and video eeg. if he does turn out to have a pathology, treatment will have to be initiated for the pathology in addition to regular anti-epileptic medicines. i suggest taking a video of these episodes that he is having. it may help convince him that he needs to visit a doctor, and it may be helpful to the doctor in seeing the condition that your husband has. yes, you need to visit a neurologist as soon as possible. ideally, i would also like to know if he has been having headaches for the past years? does he seem to be having episodes where he does not recollect what he has been doing for a certain duration of time? you may need to talk to his colleagues at work and find out if he has been having seizures or any abnormal behavior at work. there is a high chance that he knows that he has been having seizures at work and not telling you about it. i have tried my best to help you. unfortunately, i cannot initiate / suggest medicines as long as the diagnosis is not confirmed because the anti-epileptics may have severe side effects. best of luck,"

"hello ... last year i had a root canal on a tooth , never had any problems . two weeks ago , i had that tooth worked on to rebuild it so that i could get a crown . when the dentist was drilling i felt a pop and what felt like something draining/ it was the strangest thing ! a swear a could feel the air when he used that device to dry the tooth off . be filled the tooth and when he was done a told him what a felt , he said he was sure it was nothing . however , for the last week or so every time i bend down or tilt my head back i get tons of pressure in that tooth . it will even ache on it a own and not because i a using the tooth to eat . does it sound like he drilled into my sinus cavity and will it heal on it a own ? should i be antibiotics to speed up the process or prevent further injury ?",1,44715,"hello, i can understand your concern. it would have been helpful if you had mentioned which tooth was treated for root canal. as you are mentioning that the tooth was black and had cracks in it, i am assuming that the tooth is in the lower front region, and you had had some trauma to the lower jaw area which made the tooth dead and also hurt the chin and lip. other possibility is that if the tooth was dead for many years, it may have developed a periapical cyst in relation with the tooth which might be pressing on the mental nerve supplying lower lip and chin and may cause numbness of those areas. alternatively, the numbness may have started after taking local anesthesia in the lower front area for some tooth problem and the injection might have been given deep. in any case, it seems that the nerve supplying sensation to the lower front area of jaw along with lower lip and chin (mental nerve) is damaged. usually, if the nerve is damaged, it can regenerate in 3-6 months and the sensations can return. if you are not sure regarding the crown on the tooth, you can avoid it for some months and take care not to bite hard things with that tooth so that it does not fracture. you can get the crown after the numbness is solved. i would also advise you to visit an oral and maxillofacial surgeon for the examination of the area and regarding numbness. he/she might take an x-ray to rule out presence of periapical lesion or cyst in relation with the tooth. crown should surely be postponed until this possibility is ruled out. i hope this information helps you. thank you for choosing chat doctor. i wish you feel better soon. best,"

hi a have been taking birth control continuously for 1 year now with one break to get my period . a have missed a couple pills and just doubled up the next day but it was also close to takin antibiotics . should a take a pregnancy test . my husband and a have unprotected sex,1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

i am ttc for the past one year and i was advice follicular study this month ( i was using sphere 100 ) and my follicles ( 2 ) ruptured around 14th/ 15th day of my cycle after taking hucog 5000 ( 13th day ) ; a am taking gestofit 400 of from 13th day . today is 21st day of my cycle and a feel a have vaginal swelling ; yesterday i threw up when i was having lunch ; is there anything i need to be concerned at . ?,1,13108,"hi, i appreciate your query would clarify the report of your follicular study to you. on the 9th day, in the right and left ovaries (of and lof) - there was no df - which means, dominant follicle. again the same findings persisted till the 13th day, that is there was no dominant follicle in any of the ovaries. et - refers to endometrial thickness which was 8 mm on day 13. collection in pod was nil, which is normal. now, to explain a normal follicular study to you. by day 9, the ovaries start producing dominant follicles, that is among the many eggs present in the ovaries, one starts maturing to develop into the dominant egg for that month. by day 13 generally, if you have a regular 28-day menstrual cycle, the dominant egg reaches a size of 20 - 22 mm. generally on day 14, ovulation occurs, that is the mature dominant egg is released from the ovary, and it is then ready for fertilization by the sperm. this is the normal studyhowever, in your case, there is no dominant follicle seen till day 13, which means that you are having an ovulatory cycle. that is, no mature egg is developing for ovulation this month. anovulatory cycles are a major cause for not being able to conceive.pod (polycystic ovarian disease) is one of the leading causes of an ovulation, apart from other conditions. you need to consult a gynecologist, and undergo further investigations for pod to rule out the cause of this follicular study. also, you might require treatment and ovulation induction (medicines to stimulate formation of follicles in the ovary). in case your cycles are delayed (longer than 28 - 30 days), there is a minor possibility that your follicles are maturing later than normal, for e.g., in a 35-day cycle, the day of ovulation would be 14 days before periods, that is on day 20 or 21. hope this helped you."

a took next choice the morning after pill after having unprotected sex 12 hrs after . a be been having pains on my side stomach and also a feel discomfort when going to the bathroom and it a been a week now and today a noticed that a had blood in my urine could this be a sign of pregnancy or an ectopic pregnancy or can the morning after pill could have caused a uti because a get the feeling that a has to go but a don to really thank you .,1,1599,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the morning after pill is 90 percent effective if taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse. so, regardless of what happened with your pill taking before your pill-free week, the morning-after pill should still be effective. many women have a delayed period after taking the morning-after pill as a side effect, but the possibility of pregnancy still exists if you are late, so you should perform a urine pregnancy test just in case. if it has not been 2 weeks yet since your unprotected encounter, it may be too early to have a positive pregnancy test, so i would repeat it in a week if that is the case. in addition, many women have an irregular period or skip entirely after they stop the pill. if you are not pregnant, you can start a new pack of pills as soon as you get them, but just use a condom as a backup for the first two weeks. you should get a period in the pill-free week as you did previously. i hope i was able to answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"a visited a new dentist for cleaning and a correction to a bonded tooth . a informed them that a was allergic to latex and they stated that they do not use latex in their office . the next day fine bumps showed up under my tongue and spread to inside my bottom lip , inside my top lip and the tip of my tongue is numb . does this sound like an allergic reaction ?",1,68915,"hello, a rash reaction on your face would be a possibility. is your rash around your mouth or limited to the side where you're filling was done? do you notice any reaction inside your mouth? this could indicate a sensitivity to a material used at the dental office. does your dentist office wear latex gloves? a rash on the face is a common reaction for latex sensitivity. most dental offices limit the use of latex. nitrite gloves or vinyl can be worn. latex sensitivity should be noted on your medical history if you find this to be the cause. an allergist could confirm the sensitivity. a medical history with controlled diabetes raises some concerns with dental treatment. surgical procedures may be at risk for delayed healing, but restorations and fillings, commonly, are not of major concern with diabetes. uncontrolled diabetes can show stress on the tissues of your mouth and compromised overall oral health that would require greater attention. you may tend to have a greater amount of inflammation with your gums and tend to not respond as quickly to gum treatment therapies. i recommend discussing and describing your condition with your dentist to decide if you require further evaluation. some trauma to the soft tissue of the face may be experienced during dental treatment and cause redness that should disappear fairly quickly. a true rash, indicating an allergic reaction, should be investigated further. additional exposures may elicit responses with increased severity and risk of anaphylaxis. should your symptoms increase, consider a visit to your physician. this may not be related to your dental care and just a coincidence. i hope my suggestions are useful to assist in your diagnosis. thank you for your inquiry. i would be glad to answer additional questions if you can provide me additional details concerning this rash."

a have been on depo- rover for almost 2 years . last month was my last shot . by hubby and a are going to try to become pregnant between now & july ... is it possible to even conceive after that short amount of time ? be have a son - back who is 7 and would like to try for one more . of a have not already conceived by mid july a am getting my tubs tied . be are already in our early 30 a and a do not wish to keep trying more than 5/6 months . any help would be great . thanks a million from andy in nyc,1,19436,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. any woman having unprotected sex is at risk for pregnancy, so it certainly is possible that you may have conceived your first month. however, 80 percent of couples will conceive within one year, so if you divide that by 12 (for each month) you have about a 6 percent chance of conceiving per cycle. sperm live in the female genital tract for up to 72 hours, so it is generally recommended when trying to get pregnant to have sex every other day between the time your period finishes and the time you feel pms symptoms (which means you have already ovulated and can no longer conceive that cycle). so i would try to be patient and understand that it sometimes can take some time to become pregnant. in the meantime, i recommend you try to eat a healthy diet, get plenty of rest, avoid alcohol and smoking and begin to take folic acid, which is a b vitamin that has been shown to help prevent birth defects. 400 micrograms daily is the standard dose, which can be purchased alone or in prenatal vitamin preparations. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and i wish you the best of luck getting pregnant! best wishes,"

alright so a been on birth control but stopped on the green pills and after those were finished didst take any for three days . be and my boyfriend had sex and he finished in me on accident this was three or four days after my period . a couple days later a started getting cramps at work and they haven gone away . a usually done get cramps on my period but a wont start that for a while and its to early to take a test ... a had sex on the eleventh this month but ended my period couple days before and a am throwing up but a feel fine,1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

hello ! i had my period on the first week of september and it lasted for 5 days ! 2 weeks later i got my period again and it lasted 3-4 days . does this mean in pregnant ? i have been trying to conceive for almost a year now . what can i do to help me conceive ?,1,10535,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. pregnacare conception is simply a combination of vitamins that help a woman have a healthy pregnancy from conception. it has no hormonal effects and should not have any impact on the regularity of your cycle nor your ability to conceive, it is not unusual for women to bleed on and off for even 6 weeks after a miscarriage so the 19-day bleeding episode you had may not have actually been a menstrual period but still could have been bleeding leftover for your d and c. so you may not be ""late"" at all, but may just have not had a real period since the pregnancy. there is no reason to assume you would have problems getting pregnant again since you have conceived naturally twice in the last year. either way, the pregnancies conception vitamins have nothing to do with your irregular bleeding. it is generally advisable to wait to try to conceive again after your first real period-so i would wait until you bleed again to resume trying to conceive. if you do not get a real period by 3 months from your last bleeding episode, you should follow up for your gun for a re-evaluation of your hormones and treatment with progesterone, which can restart your period cycling. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful. best wishes,"
hello ! i had my period on the first week of september and it lasted for 5 days ! 2 weeks later i got my period again and it lasted 3-4 days . does this mean in pregnant ? i have been trying to conceive for almost a year now . what can i do to help me conceive ?,2,52747,"hello, and i hope i can clarify this for you. you are absolutely correct in the fact that the length of your cycle is related to when you ovulate... and your ovulation date is 14 days back from when you got your period, rather than counting 14 days from the start of your period. it is typical for most women to have a 14-day luteal phase, as you suggested. you absolutely may ovulate later in your cycle. i do not know how long you and your partner have tried to conceive before trying closed. i would not recommend trying closed at all unless you have tried for a year (meaning unprotected sex at least 2-3 times per week) and not become pregnant. a reproductive endocrinologist is an appropriate referral if you have a history of infertility for one year, and if you fail at least 3 cycles of closed. they can prescribe closed and combine it with intrauterine insemination, which can increase the success rate. even though you may have had a child together before, there can be an issue with the male partner too, and it would be advisable he gets his sperm count evaluated. but you can still have conceived this cycle if you ovulated on the closed, and continued to have unprotected sex at least a week after your ovulation kit showed positive. your progesterone level pre-ovulation is not relevant at all. so- if you don't get a period by day 35 or so, do a pregnancy test. and if you didn't conceive this cycle, a reproductive endocrinologist might be a better choice to manage your closed. i hope this answered your question, and best of luck in getting pregnant. take care,"

"age 10 yrs , it 27kgs my son is suffering from asthma since past 6yrs . we tried all the possible medications.since my husbands job is transferable , some places suit him and some doesn't . at present he is on aeroflot and monte la ( for 3 months ) . the day i avoid him monte , next day he feels breathless.i am worried since long term dosage of steroids might have some or the sideeffects.is there any other alternative ?",1,45065,"hi there, i understand your concern, and i would like to assure you that the montage is appropriate for him at this time. montage, or montelukast can be taken for allergies and asthma both as a relief and maintenance therapy. it all depends on how long he will be exposed to the allergens. in fact, it would suit him if it is very clearly a seasonal type allergy, because then he can take it throughout the pollen season, and stop it the rest of the year. what the other doctor means is that it is not appropriate for immediate rescue the way a nebulizer can be used, because it takes a few hours to even be absorbed. if your son is very breathless, it probably will not work fast enough, much like how an antihistamine is not meant to stop the allergy immediately. you should find that adding on montage will make him need the nebulizer less frequently, because it brings down the general level of allergic reaction in the body. i will repeat that it is not meant to replace the nebulizer, which is a short term rescue solution when he is breathless. hopefully, just decreasing the need for nebulizers will make his allergy more manageable through the season. hope this helps, and all the best to you."

(regular use of emergency pill is harmful)conception occurs if she was in 10th to 18th day of her cycle(in a regular cycle of 28 day duration). you can ask her at what day she is in and wait for next cycle to occur. if it delayed by 7 days then get done upt to diagnose if pregnant and then the required treatment can be taken. regards"

"key , last night a was in the store and saw some bee pollen and it claimed it would help with allergies so a ingested a spoonful and a got a sore throat and runny nose about 30 minutes after and a woke up with a sore throat and congestion today and a feel like crap . should a be concerned ?",1,21109,"yes, it can very well be a viral infection. the sore throat and nose congestion along with the aches and pains points out to a viral organism causing the symptoms. rashes are also part of a classical viral origin flu. since you don't have fever you need not worry much. viral infections usually get resolved on its own. use warm salt water gargle to help with the sore throat and steam inhalation will help with the congestion. most probably the cough is due to the flow of your nasal secretions towards your throat. as for the stomach cramps it might be due to the intake of antibiotics resulting in gastritis. symptomatic relief can also be provided by certain anti histamines. i hope i answered your query in a satisfactory manner. thank you."

"hello dr. matthew can i go for gym if my have some symptoms of jaundice , i just found out that i have got mild fatty changes on my liver , at the same time my bilirubin level is also slightly above the recommended range . need your suggestion . thanks",2,65018,"hi thanks for the question. i assume that your baby is more than a week old. most of the babies have yellow discoloration of skin and sclera during the first few days of life. this is called physiological jaundice, and it subsides on its own without any intervention. this is a normal phenomenon as a result of transition from fetal to extrauterine life. you should be aware when jaundice is a cause of concern: 1. if jaundice appears on first day of life2. if the level of bilirubin is more than 12 mg/dl. bilirubin is the substance that causes the yellow coloration of skin. its level can be checked with a blood test .3. if the rise in bilirubin level is more than 5 mg/dl/hr. for this your doctor my prescribe repeated test and then plot the levels on a graph to predict the expected rise in bilirubin.4. if direct bilirubin is more the 2 mg/dl or 20% of the total. bilirubin is of two types physiological jaundice is due to the water insoluble indirect bilirubin so if direct component is high it means it's not physiological and should be a cause for concern. the direct and indirect breakage is given in the blood test. 5. if your baby is otherwise unwell e.g. is lethargic, is not feeding well, has fever or difficulty breathing then its not physiological jaundice because in that case your baby will be otherwise totally ok. you have asked if your baby needs incubator care. incubators are for premature babies who can not maintain their body temperatures as they have arrived earlier, and temperature control mechanisms have not yet been established. the incubator provides specific temperature. incubators are not used for the treatment of any type of jaundice. phototherapy is used for that. these are specially lights that convert the indirect water insoluble bilirubin into water soluble forms that can then be excreted out through urine. as i have told high levels of direct bilirubin are a cause of concern and these need treatment with a phototherapy unit. your doctor may prescribe phototherapy if your child has any of the criteria i have mentioned earlier, but incubator care is not needed as your baby is not premature and is at least older than a week. if you have any other questions i will be happy to answer."

"hello , pm 19 . a just started birth control pills ( mercian 28 ) 7 days ago . a have never been on any contraceptives before . a started my bop 24 days after my period came , a had unprotected sex with my boyfriend on my suppose ovulation day and he came in my anal . be had sex again the next two days unprotected . two days after a start my bop which was 26days after my period , we had sex and he came in me and we have sex for three days after that and he came in me overtime , can i be pregnant ?",1,33341,"hi, if you came to my clinic with those complaints i would ask you to stop worrying. many women that start using the pills for the first time experience similar problems. i understand that you have taken the inactive pills first and then started on the active pills. also, you have had intercourse only after your period was over that is about 11 days ago. the chances of pregnancy occurring after a single act of unprotected sexual intercourse are only 4%. also, for women that have regular periods the chance of getting pregnant is more if intercourse occurs after 11-12 days since the first day of the period. hence, the chances of getting pregnant are low if you have had contact before this period. you are also having a sick feeling in the stomach and most probably a cramp like feeling. this may be due to the pills as some females take time to get adjusted and may improve with continuous use and by taking the pills with food. the pills are not known to cause any major effect on the baby if they are inadvertently taken in early pregnancy. since you have started taking the active pills late, i would recommend that you use a backup contraceptive measure like condoms, for the next 7 days while you still take the pills to avoid pregnancy. i would be pleased to answer any further queries that you may have, enjoy a wonderful day."

i ! by mon is 53 years old and a few days ago she was eating dinner and suddenly had a prickling feeling on her tongue . when we checked she had a bulge that was black in colour and about the size of a pea . after 15 minutes or so it had tripled in size and then it burst causing a lot of bleeding . would it be a burst blood vessel ?,1,95830,"hello, she probably had the aneurysm for a long time that steadily became larger and one day burst open causing bleeding inside her brain. the recovery after treating a ruptured aneurysm depends on the amount of bleeding that has already taken place and the patients condition at the time of admission. for example a patient with just headache will recover quicker that a patient in coma and unarguable. if she was unconscious when she was admitted and had a big bleed, then the recovery can be long and can leave residual neurodeficit if the patient survives. i hope this helps you understand. chat doctor."

a lost my virginity on the 12 used a condom but after a was nervous & cleaned my penis with rubbing alcohol & a little bit got in the inside . about 4-5 days ago a started having this tingling feeling in the middle of the shaft . a few days ago a keep getting the urge to pee even if a don to have to go . & today a seen a little bit of yellowish discharge . to a have an std or is my body reacting to the rubbing alcohol ?,1,33341,"hi, if you came to my clinic with those complaints i would ask you to stop worrying. many women that start using the pills for the first time experience similar problems. i understand that you have taken the inactive pills first and then started on the active pills. also, you have had intercourse only after your period was over that is about 11 days ago. the chances of pregnancy occurring after a single act of unprotected sexual intercourse are only 4%. also, for women that have regular periods the chance of getting pregnant is more if intercourse occurs after 11-12 days since the first day of the period. hence, the chances of getting pregnant are low if you have had contact before this period. you are also having a sick feeling in the stomach and most probably a cramp like feeling. this may be due to the pills as some females take time to get adjusted and may improve with continuous use and by taking the pills with food. the pills are not known to cause any major effect on the baby if they are inadvertently taken in early pregnancy. since you have started taking the active pills late, i would recommend that you use a backup contraceptive measure like condoms, for the next 7 days while you still take the pills to avoid pregnancy. i would be pleased to answer any further queries that you may have, enjoy a wonderful day."

"a have had 2 miscarriages since december or 09 , i woke up yesterday and had a feeling that a could be pregnant again . it is to early for me to test , according to my last period a would be 3 weeks today , since a have had problems in the past should i wait to find out or go to my doctor for a blood test .",1,10535,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. pregnacare conception is simply a combination of vitamins that help a woman have a healthy pregnancy from conception. it has no hormonal effects and should not have any impact on the regularity of your cycle nor your ability to conceive, it is not unusual for women to bleed on and off for even 6 weeks after a miscarriage so the 19-day bleeding episode you had may not have actually been a menstrual period but still could have been bleeding leftover for your d and c. so you may not be ""late"" at all, but may just have not had a real period since the pregnancy. there is no reason to assume you would have problems getting pregnant again since you have conceived naturally twice in the last year. either way, the pregnancies conception vitamins have nothing to do with your irregular bleeding. it is generally advisable to wait to try to conceive again after your first real period-so i would wait until you bleed again to resume trying to conceive. if you do not get a real period by 3 months from your last bleeding episode, you should follow up for your gun for a re-evaluation of your hormones and treatment with progesterone, which can restart your period cycling. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful. best wishes,"

"i had sex a week ago from yesterday , he was wearing a condom and ejaculated in the condom , and the condom slipped off , and we continued to have sex without knowing the condom slipped off . i took the morning after pill 20 hours after having sex ... and i was suppose to have my period yesterday . what do i expect ?",1,22940,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, the depo-provera injection becomes immediately effective against pregnancy the day you get the shot. the reason why it is recommended for you to start taking demo while you have your period is to make sure that you have not already become pregnant and get the injection while pregnant. so if you had a shot two weeks ago, even if you had a condom accident, and especially since you took morning-after pill, there is no reason to suspect that you are risk for pregnancy. however, a urinary tract infection, which is inflammation of the bladder, can occur after sex if chafing during sex especially externally rubs bacteria into the urethra (the urinary opening). this is common in women who use condoms as the ring on the condom can irritate this area during penetration. so i think you can be reassured that your symptoms are not due to pregnancy. however, i think you most likely do have a uti and should visit your local physician or clinic for evaluation, so you can get a prescription for antibiotics to treat it. if you are now going to be having unprotected sex with your current partner, you both should be tested for stds to make sure that you are not at risk of giving anything to one another. however, this point there is no evidence that your symptoms could be caused by an std. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

i my name is allen a a very concern about my husband he a my life he has had 5bypasses 3yrs in june . is blood pressure 88/69 and his pulse is 140 his blood pressure had been like this since his surgery but is heart rate had been up for about a week what is the danger ?,2,104845,"hello. thanks for posting here. i have noted his history. what is important is whether he had symptoms during the low blood pressure episode. angioplasty directly can't cause low blood pressure. but since he has got an angioplasty that means he has some heart issues which can cause low blood pressure. so again if he had symptoms like dizziness, feeling weak, loss of consciousness, sweating, then it is a matter of concern. another factor here is that since he has undergone an angioplasty, he must be on blood pressure medications. some medications which keep the heart rate in control can also cause low blood pressure. so in short there are many factors that should be evaluated here. if he has another low blood pressure episode consider stopping or decreasing dose of one blood pressure medication. also, if the reading was from a home electronic bp monitor please get it checked. alternatively you can also get your pressure checked with the same machine to check its accuracy. (only if it is an electronic machine). thank you"

"hi , in a 24 years old female ( student ) and i have been coughing for 3 years or so years now . it first i was told i had bronchitis and then a was later told that i might have asthma . i was given affair , albuterol , prednisone , singular , clarity and antibiotic ( when it first started ) . but i done think its really helping . i often cough when i have from one place to another . i guess its the change of smell of the environment . i cough and have tinkle feel in my head when i go to place where there are too many different smell going on . do you think i have smelling allergies ? also my bones ( the joints ) often make a pop/ click noise when i move around especially my pelvic bone . i asked my doctor and she said it might be gas but i think their might be something wrong . because when i run , i feel pain in my leg bone . in not sure if in lacking calcium because i done really eat food that contain calcium . for the reason i just started taking some multi it and calcium supplement . what do you think ?",1,58987,"his am chat doctor. i have read your message. i think i can help you. first, a package test means that multiple tests are included that correlate to the test. cpk and spe can both be package tests as there are many related tests needed in a diagnosis. the symptoms that you seem to be facing as per the query is basically severe backache that increases on lying down or bending-in other words, anything that causes the spine to be under pressure. now she itself can cause the symptoms. the muscles and bone problems can arise in she itself and thus possibly one will feel that there is nothing more to do. however, in many situations, the doctors may get biased my a diagnosis. so, i think it is good that your doctor did not get biased with your pre-existing diagnosis of she and continued to look for other causes of backache. a severe backache can happen due to muscle disorders, a condition known as myopathy. the cause of myopathy may be she itself. the test commonly done to test myopathy is cpk or creatine phospholipase. this is a test done from blood. the idea is if the cpk is raised, it suggests myopathy. in this situation, your doctor will need to modify the therapy. i am unaware of your medication from the query. so i cannot really comment upon it. but some medicines themselves cause myopathy. and sometimes, the dose of existing medicines need to be stepped up for treatment of myopathy. so i presume your doctor wanted to check that. second test was spe or serum protein electrophoresis. this is one of the tests for multiple myeloma. this is a type of malignancy that affects the bones and causes bone pains and should be ruled out in middle-aged to elderly commonly if the backache is worsening and is specially bad when lying down. if the test is negative, there is nothing to worry about. if it does come out to be positive, multiple myeloma can be treated. so again you need not worry since the treatment is available. why the doctor did not tell you about the tests is something i can only speculate about. i guess it was because these are just doubts, considering you already have she- in medicine, the usual dictum is that one disease can explain the symptom, the other condition should not be sought. having said that, it's a folly to miss another diagnosis due to a pre-existing condition. i think he would have told you if the tests came out positive. so there should be nothing to worry about-the doctor was just making sure that there is no other problem. possibly since there was nothing else diagnosed, he did not tell you about it. i have tried to make it as simple as possible to understand the situation. in case there are still doubts, feel free to contact me for further details. best of luck,"
