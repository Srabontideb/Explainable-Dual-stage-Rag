"key , a just started to take birth control pills forsythia . a started on monday , it want my period or anything . a just want to start as soon as possible to prevent pregnancy . to a know a need to have second back up plan when a first took the pills . how long after a take those pills that starts to prevent pregnancy ?",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"i doctor , a have a question for my mother who have a high papillary carcinoma .. she is 64 yrs ... she consult the doctor and the doctor said if she undergo a surgery there a a lot of complication be she also taking a medicine for high blood and cholesterol . a wan a ask what is the best thing to do , and if she don to go undergo surgery do you have some medicine or any advice for her to do .. els help me thank you ... looking forward to your answer .",1,22694,"hello thanks for posting here. i have gone through your description. she has critical heart disease involving the three arteries if the heart. and since her pumping function has chat doctor. so once blocked arteries in the heart are diagnosed, there are two methods to open it. angioplasty and bypass surgery. as your doctor has advice angioplasty cannot be done because of triple vessel disease and also involving the arteries where they bifurcate. so surgery is the only option in her. surgery with a low pumping function is definitely riskier than one with a normal function. but here you have to assess the risk versus benefits. if you don't do the surgery then you are not treating the cause. her quality of life will be poor, she will get tired easily, and she stands the probability of having further heart attacks also which will further decrease the function. going ahead with the surgery will improve quality of life, she can do her day-to-day activities, travel etc. however despite surgery pumping function will not increase more than 35%. but the risks of heart attacks is evaded. another thing that should be considered is how mobile she is. as you said she has left sided weakness. if she is bed bound and requires help for her day-to-day activities, then a surgery would be more of a suffering to her. a cabg surgery has a good outcome and patients usually do well for 12-15 years. nowadays with advanced technologies and approaches, heart surgery risks have come down a lot. i personally have seen patients with 25-30% do well with cabg. so my advice is it will be worthwhile to take a call for cabg.

(provided that allergy testing is reliable)for dust allergy, specific allergen immunotherapy can be advised by an allergist-immunologist after thorough allergy evaluation.2. i would agree with his treatment suggested by his doctor. however, were i treating him, i would add montelukast and levocetirizine to above treatment. 3. soured 20 is corticosteroid. in severe asthma symptoms, it may be necessary to give oral corticosteroids. a short course of 3-5 days of corticosteroids does not cause significant long term side effects. so as his doctor thinks soured 20 is necessary for him at present, i would agree with him. treating doctor is the best judge of the children condition.4. if he needs repeated asthma symptoms or repeated corticosteroid courses, i would suggest him regular medications like montelukast or inhaled corticosteroids. (inhaled corticosteroids are much safer than oral corticosteroids, but are less useful in acute symptoms)so i would suggest you to review his symptoms with his doctor to discuss the need of regular medications.5. i would suggest him to avoid the exposure to dusts, smokes & air pollution as much as possible.6. a healthy diet rich in vitamins & minerals (adequate amounts of green leafy vegetables, fruits, sprouts, etc.) will also help him in a longer run by improving his immunity. hope above suggestions will be helpful to him. should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at chat doctor. wish your son the best of the health. thank you & regards."

by nine year daughter often has a distended stomach . be have taken bread out of her diet which has helped but from time to time she is full of gas . the has been tested and is not a celia . that other foods should we eliminate ? all suggestions welcome .,1,111372,"hello. thank you for asking at chat doctor. i went through your daughters' history. from your history, i would first think of chronic gastritis or gastroesophageal reflux disease. i would like to make suggestions to you as follows:1. if she has never been tested for food allergies, i would suggest testing for food allergies, especially, milk, peanut, wheat, soy, eggs, tree nuts, fish, shell fish. she needs not to be tested for all the foods above, choose the foods she is normally/frequently eating. food allergies, especially milk protein allergy, can cause chronic gastritis. it important to know that milk protein allergy is not same as lactose intolerance. one has to avoid milk and all milk products in milk protein allergy.2. for treatment, i would suggest her a 6-8 weeks course of antacids like omeprazole or pantoprazole before each meal. it is important to remember that she should take continuously for minimum 6 weeks even she is free of symptoms as complete healing of inner lining of stomach/esophagus takes 4-6 weeks.3. if she has to take frequent pain relievers, i would suggest preferring paracetamol to all other pain medications. all other medications like ibuprofen, diclofenac, mafenamic are notorious to cause gastritis. paracetamol is considered the safest among pain medications in terms of gastritis.4. i would also suggest her to avoid hot & spicy foods as well as caffeinated beverages. a soft, bland diet is would be the best. 5. if she does not improve with above measures, i would think of h.pylori infection and treat her with appropriate antibiotics after necessary tests. hope above point will be useful to you. wish your daughter a quick recovery and the best of the health. should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at chat doctor. thank you & regards."

"hi doctor , i am verna . my wisdom tooth in my left side has been growing . but since past 3 days i have noticed that the gum around that area has swollen . and there are small white boils which looks like white heads forming on top of the swollen gum . please it a know what it is . thanks",1,37525,"thanks for your query, i have gone through your query. the reddish white area with swollen gum is because of the gum impingement by the opposing tooth. it can be frictional keratitis along with a traumatic ulcer. consult an oral physician and get it evaluated. if it is a wisdom tooth that is impinging on the gums, then get it removed. there is no meaning in keeping the wisdom tooth when the opposing tooth is missing. i hope my answer will help you, take care."

"a went and had an ultrasound two days ago and the doctor did to want to talk to me about what was going on , a a meant to be 11 weeks pregnant today . but the ultrasound said a was only 6 weeks . which is pretty much a whole month different . in the report it says they can to see a yolk sac which does to make sense . a just need someone to go through this with me . please",1,59414,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. this ultrasound report, translated out of medical jargon, is as follows:there is a pregnant uterus noted with an amniotic sac present, but no fetus visible yet or yolk sac. human fetuses normally have a yolk, just like a chicken egg, usually from about 6 weeks until 9-10 week or so. this report estimates the sac to be about the size for a 5-6 week pregnancy. also, the uterus ""decimal reaction"" and ""bulky"" ovary are also normal during pregnancy. the radiologist recommends repeating another ultrasound in a week or so to check for the development of a yolk sac and a fetus. the heartbeat is usually present by 7 weeks of pregnancy. i hope i was able to explain the meaning of this report for you, and that the information i gave you was helpful and reassuring. best wishes,"

all i see is the doctors saying heart murmurs agent harmful and if they are its just from infections and being born with it . in 19 but i ( was ) a smoker and i smoked maryland and pigs but what in asking is was it tobacco that caused my heart murmur ? and i was just jogging like 20 mind ago and my heart begin to beat very fast and irregularly so what should i do to help build a strong heart ?,1,25338,"hello and thank you for using chat doctor. i carefully read your question and understand your concern. but you should not worry, its nothing serious. as you describe, my opinion is that it might be a rhythm issue. someone can feel strong and fast heart beats for different reasons. it may be a simple sinus tachycardia. this means that the heart is beating faster than 100 beats for minute. its normal range in a resting condition is between 60-100 beats for minute. when it goes up you may feel a strong heart beat in your chest and a sensation like your body is beating too. another reason for this sensation might be what we call an ekstrasystol.these is electrical heart impulses that generates in some parts of heart different from normal sinus rhythm. this generates an escaped beat that the person feels like jumping ore bumping. it gives the sensation like a beat is skipping, may experience palpitations or an anxiety sensation that your daughter explains like trembling. this extrasistoles may happen from different reasons from simple emotional stress to other pathologies like anemia, hyperthyroidism etc. so, my opinion as cardiologist is that you have nothing to worry. it is just a simple episode, and it is quite normal in younger ages. only if these symptoms persist and begins to interfere the daily live, if i was your treating doctor i will recommend some examinations like a blood analysis to exclude anemia, the thyroid hormones, an electrocardiogram, echocardiography and of course a holder monitoring. this will help us to document and see what happens with heart rhythm. at meantime, i will recommend your daughter to avoid coffee, caffeine products because they rise heart frequency and extrasistolic beats. i encourage her to have physical training because sometimes it helps in reducing extrasistoles, tachycardia, even making them disappear. wish i was helpful. take good care. best regards"

"a just experienced some serious anxiety at a meeting a was attending that was very stressful and my heart actually jumped in my chest ... no pain but it jumped . it felt like it was in the left side of my chest , not in the middle . a am 48 years old and recently had a stress echocardiogram done because a was told years ago that a had a micro valve prolapse . the results showed nothing with my valves except what they described as a very very minor prolapse , no leakage . that could this jumping in my chest be cause by .",1,100009,"greetings! thank you for your question and welcome to chat doctor. i carefully read your query. mitral valve prolapse (mvp) is a benign condition that is estimated to be found in 16% of young ladies, and it may take up to forty or fifty years to produce symptoms, only after a chronic mitral regurgitation is installed. i would go on and say that further clinical investigation should be in order at this time, but i am quite confident that, if something was wrong with the mitral valve and the mitral regurgitation was there, it would have been told to you during the before 6 months echocardiogram. it would be only when a mitral regurgitation produced by a mitral valve prolapse that would enlarge the left atrium, when the high pressures in the enlarged left atrium would produce shortness of breath and, maybe, rapid heart rate corresponding with an atrial arrhythmia. and it would have shown in the echocardiogram, if the left atrium was enlarged. my opinion is that your problem is not being produced by the mitral valve prolapse, at this moment, at least. however, if this is a worrisome situation to you, then another echocardiogram should be done. of course, if mitral valve is found on a bad shape, after carefully measuring the function, size, and grade of regurgitation, adding to the possible symptoms, it is only then when mitral valve should be surgically replaced. as for the stress side, indeed substantial amounts of stress have their clear effect on the heart, by putting it to a significant dynamic state and by producing a chat doctor. there are a lot of natural means to reduce stress, starting from self-fighting of the stress to yoga or other methods. if this becomes problematic to you and affects your quality of life and work, i would recommend you a consult with a clinical psychologist regarding a course of sedatives to reduce it. i hope i was helpful. best regards."

"a have a question about lap whole . a had a baby 8 months ago and been having gallbladder symptoms in middle to end of pm to now . of of gallbladder good , ef=27 % . want get into dr. until oct. 5th for consult but a work with or at times and know he will want to take it out . is this a low enough of to go though surgery ? symptoms are : main in upper middle quadrant of and ( sometimes mild sometimes severe ) , nausea , occasional vomiting , constipation/diarrhea , left sided chest pain ( ekg normal ) , and fullness after eating .",1,77921,"most people who have gallstones do not have symptoms. if you have symptoms, you most likely will have mild pain in the pit of your stomach or in the upper right part of your belly. pain may spread to your right upper back or shoulder blade area. sometimes the pain is more severe. it may be steady, or it may come and go. or it may get worse when you eat. you may decide to go to the doctor because of pain in your belly. in this case, your doctor will ask you questions about when the pain started, where it is, and if it comes and goes or is always there. your doctor may order imaging tests. these take pictures of the inside of your body. an ultrasound of the belly is the best test to find gallstones. this test does not hurt. your ultrasound may not show gallstones. but if your doctor still thinks you have a problem with your gallbladder, he or she may order a gallbladder scan. in this test, a doctor injects dye into a vein in your arm. then a machine takes x-rays as the dye moves through your liver, bile duct, gallbladder, and intestine. if you do not have symptoms, you probably do not need treatment. if your first gallstone attack causes mild pain, your doctor may tell you to take pain medicine and wait to see if the pain goes away. you may never have another attack. waiting to see what happens usually will not cause problems. if you have a bad attack, or if you have a second attack, you may want to have your gallbladder removed. a second attack means you are more likely to have future attacks. many people have their gallbladders removed, and the surgery usually goes well. doctors most often use laparoscopic surgery. for this, your surgeon will make small cuts in your belly and remove your gallbladder. you will probably be able to go back to work or your normal routine in a week or two, but it may take longer for some people. sometimes the surgeon will have to make a larger cut to remove the gallbladder. it will take longer for you to recover from this type of surgery. regards and take care"

a am using the birth control yak . this is my second month on it and the first month my period came when i was on my 3rd white pill and it ended up lasting a week . a had unprotected sex while i was on my last active pill and now i am getting ready to start my new pack on sunday and i have not gotten my period . i know there is a possibility of pregnancy but how soon is too soon to take a test and get accurate results ?,1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"about a month ago a had a tooth cap put in . there was excess cement around the tooth . about the same time , a got an odd metallic like taste in my mouth along with hoarseness and at times a sore throat . the dentist has looked over the cap and sees no infection . any suggestions ?",1,29313,hello! thank you for posting here. you did not mention if you took any medication during the placement of cap and other dental treatment. some medicines like metronidazole can cause metallic taste. this will reduce in a weeks time. your dentist will remove any excess cement around the cap. do not panic. take azithromycin for 3 days. also take cetirizine for the symptomatic relief. i suggest you to see your dentist if the tissues around the cap are red or irritated. do warm saline gargle thrice daily. have more water intake.
"about a month ago a had a tooth cap put in . there was excess cement around the tooth . about the same time , a got an odd metallic like taste in my mouth along with hoarseness and at times a sore throat . the dentist has looked over the cap and sees no infection . any suggestions ?",2,87746,hi. thanks for the query. as per your complaint and explanation of symptoms if there is blister over the gum of the tooth that has a cap can be most probably due to secondary decay in tooth caused due to seepage of fluids and debris between the cap and tooth. it can also be due to deep infection in the gums leading to accumulation of bacteria deep into the gum pocket leading to pus formation and formation of a gum abscess. black discoloration around tooth along with sensitivity to hot and cold is also indication of infection in tooth and not simply tattoo. so my suggestion is to consult an endodontist and get evaluated and a thorough clinical evaluation and investigation like x-ray of both the capped teeth has to be done followed by appropriate treatment. in case of tooth decay removal of cap followed by root canal treatment can help. in case of gum infection deep scaling and curettage can help. hope your query is resolved. regards.

"air , a had unsafe sex with by girl friend and another day she had the unwanted pregnancy pill , and it a been like one week ago , and she misses her period this month and she is suffering back ache too much even she sleeps too much now . please tell me what is this ?",1,46193,"hallow dear, precum is pre-ejaculation secretion which is expelled out unknowingly. it does contain some sperms which can cause pregnancy. however, you had this experience 4 days after her period. this day is rather safe as far as the risk of pregnancy is considered. egg is released 14 days prior to next expected menses. egg has a life of 24 hours while sperms are active for 3 days. hence, a period of about a week around the day of egg release is considered as fertile window. 4 days after the menses falls quite away from fertile window. still, i would say, better to err on safer side. hence, she should take post-coital emergency contraceptive pill protection. these pills have to be taken within 72 hours after the unprotected sex. if this period is already over, she may get intrauterine contraceptive device inserted within 5 days of this unprotected sex. this will give her protection from the pregnancy and moreover will give her ongoing contraception for years to come. if 5 days also are over, you cannot do anything now. just wait for her periods to appear (which mostly she will get). if she misses her period, get pregnancy test done on her urine after one week; earlier the results may be false negative. alternatively, you may get her blood checked for beta chat doctor for diagnosing pregnancy, 10 days after this incidence. if she is pregnant, she can get the pregnancy terminated by medicines safely and effectively up to 9 weeks of gestation. however, this has to be done with gynecologists advice and prescription only. and lastly, any step she takes is to be done with her parents consent since she is minor; otherwise it will be an illegal offense. i hope this provides you detailed guidelines."

"a fell on my mouth , split my lip , and my front tooth was hurting a lot . that was a week ago . it is still not feeling normal , but the pain is gone.i am wondering if there is anything a should do about it other than just try not to mess with it ? a stopped wearing my retainer because a was concerned that it might cause damage . that should a do ?",1,35752,"hello and thank you for using chat doctor. i carefully read your question and i understand your concern. i will give you my opinion about this. you explain about fast, racing heart beats and feeling dizzy, light head. my opinion as a cardiologist is that these symptoms are related with some heart rhythm issues. it might be possible that the doctors do not find anything, because you are under normal rhythm when you meat the doctors. this rhythm problem might be different. the most important one is atrial fibrillation. this is an arrhythmia when the heart runs in a chaotic way. this is why you might feel your heart running fast. also, it doesn't wok properly, it doesn't feel normally and for this reason the person might experience dizziness, lightheaded. this rhythm issue might happen once a wile, it comes and go, and so it is difficult to catch it. so, my opinion is that you should do some examinations, where the most important one is holder rhythm monitoring for 48 h. taking the monitor for 48 h rises the possibility to catch the rhythm problem if it is any. i don't know if you already did it, but you may repeat it again to rise the possibility to catch something. also, i will recommend a cardiac echo, a blood analyze to exclude anemia or thyroid gland problems that cause this kind of problems sometimes. if all these examinations result normal, than you should not worry. only after this we might say that every thing is alright, its just stress. hope i was helpful. wish you good health. best regards."

"hello , a have a slightly swollen round area with a white spot in the middle of it . it is located on my front lower gums right below one of my teeth . by tooth doesn't hurt at all but the gum does especially when my mouth is moving . ave never had this problem and a am not sure what it is ? hope someone can help me , thank you",1,37525,"thanks for your query, i have gone through your query. the reddish white area with swollen gum is because of the gum impingement by the opposing tooth. it can be frictional keratitis along with a traumatic ulcer. consult an oral physician and get it evaluated. if it is a wisdom tooth that is impinging on the gums, then get it removed. there is no meaning in keeping the wisdom tooth when the opposing tooth is missing. i hope my answer will help you, take care."
"hello , a have a slightly swollen round area with a white spot in the middle of it . it is located on my front lower gums right below one of my teeth . by tooth doesn't hurt at all but the gum does especially when my mouth is moving . ave never had this problem and a am not sure what it is ? hope someone can help me , thank you",2,53390,hi. can understand your concern. as per your complaint the swollen gum and the white material inside it is a result of some inflammation. there can be a few reasons depending upon whether it is the second molar or the wisdom tooth. in case it is a wisdom tooth which is erupting or is impacted then the gum above it can get infected and inflamed due to either food deposition between the gum and the wisdom tooth or it can be due to gum flap bitten by the opposite jaw tooth and the condition is known as peritonitis. the white material in it is pus. in case it is second molar the swollen gum with white material in it can be as a result of infection in the gums due to deposits on the teeth like plaque or calculus or due to foreign body impaction in the gums which carries infection along with it deeper into the gums causing pus formation. it can also be due to deeply infected tooth causing pus formation below the tips of the roots of the tooth causing swelling on the gums with pus inside. i would suggest you to consult a dentist and get evaluated for the exact cause of the swelling and get treated accordingly. in case if it is wisdom tooth either excision of gum flap or extraction if the tooth is impacted followed by antibiotics and painkillers can be done. in case of gum infection professional cleaning of teeth followed by antibiotics and gum paints can help. in case of tooth infection root canal treatment or extraction depending on the condition of the tooth can be done. hope your query is solved. if you find the answer helpful please write a positive review and click on find this answer helpful as a token of appreciation. thanks and regards. chat doctor.

"i , pm 33 years old . a had undergone two surgical abortions , one i 2001 and the other in 2004.planning to conceive now again . that are the complications that may arise ? is there any chance of miscarriage ?",1,64838,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the pelvis that cannot be removed completely by surgery. the reason is that endometriosis implants can be microscopic, which is why ultimately most women are treated with hormones to suppress their menstrual cycle for 3 to 6 months after endometriosis surgery. this helps to prevent recurrence of cysts and scarring within your pelvis which may increase your chance of conceiving. however, while you are on the leuprolide (lu pron) injection, you will not menstruate regularly and is unlikely that you will become pregnant. your greatest chance of pregnancy is in the first six months after stopping the medication. because you only 32 years old, i would recommend doing a full six months of lu pron injections before trying to conceive again. so again to clarify, you do not need lu pron because you had any complications from your surgery, rather the issue is that lu pron reduces your risk of recurrence of endometriosis after surgery, which will help to maximize your chance of conceiving later. so there is no reason why you and your husband cannot have unprotected intercourse while you on the lu pron treatment, however the goal of the treatment is to reduce the inflammation your pelvis after the surgery to help you heal and also to reset your hormones so when you go off the lu pron you will be in the best shape to conceive. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that i helped clarify the role lu pron has in the treatment of endometriosis. i wish you and your husband the best of luck in conceiving,"

"a had a crown put on a tooth two years ago and now there is puss coming out around that tooth when a press on the gum below . there is not pain or anything else alarming . the dentist did not do a root canal as it was a missing filling and had no pain or sensitivity to air or water at the time . again , the tooth is still not giving me any pain or other symptoms other than the puss every morning . thanks",1,91057,"hi. can understand your concern. as per your complaint if you have pain in the gum below the tooth that was filled 3 months back there may be a few reasons for it. one can be that when the cavity was made to clear off the decay, some portion of the infection must have left out and filling was done over it. now the infection that was left out further progressed and reached pulp that is central portion of tooth containing nerves and blood vessels and through there to the root canals inside roots and finally reaching the bone below root tips causing infection and pus formation which causes pain on touching the gums. other reason can be that there could have been some leakage through the filling causing seepage of food debris below the filling and thereby causing infection which infects pulp and progresses below root tips and causes pain and pus formation. one more reason can be that the cavity made for filling is chat doctor. i would suggest you to consult your dentist and get an iop ar (x-ray)done so that the exact cause of pain is understood. in most circumstances of pain in tooth after filling the treatment to be carried out is root canal treatment in which entire pulp is extirpated and filling is done in root canals as well as crown of tooth... hope your query is solved. thanks and regards."

a had a pinkish discharge and then a started my period the same day a had unprotected sex but a went off my period for a little while then it came back the next day .. remind you a had just came off my period 2 weeks before than and a had stopped taking birth control pills 4days after a started them 2 days after my period had ended ...,1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"
a had a pinkish discharge and then a started my period the same day a had unprotected sex but a went off my period for a little while then it came back the next day .. remind you a had just came off my period 2 weeks before than and a had stopped taking birth control pills 4days after a started them 2 days after my period had ended ...,2,33341,"hi, if you came to my clinic with those complaints i would ask you to stop worrying. many women that start using the pills for the first time experience similar problems. i understand that you have taken the inactive pills first and then started on the active pills. also, you have had intercourse only after your period was over that is about 11 days ago. the chances of pregnancy occurring after a single act of unprotected sexual intercourse are only 4%. also, for women that have regular periods the chance of getting pregnant is more if intercourse occurs after 11-12 days since the first day of the period. hence, the chances of getting pregnant are low if you have had contact before this period. you are also having a sick feeling in the stomach and most probably a cramp like feeling. this may be due to the pills as some females take time to get adjusted and may improve with continuous use and by taking the pills with food. the pills are not known to cause any major effect on the baby if they are inadvertently taken in early pregnancy. since you have started taking the active pills late, i would recommend that you use a backup contraceptive measure like condoms, for the next 7 days while you still take the pills to avoid pregnancy. i would be pleased to answer any further queries that you may have, enjoy a wonderful day."

(before the pills) i recommend :-wait for another week after the placebos are over. if no period, take a pregnancy test. if negative wait for another week and see your organ to check any hormonal imbalances or functional ovarian cysts (which are benign) that could be causing the delay in periods. some irregularities in menstrual cycle and flow is expected while starting the pill (about 3 months). this regulates over time. to answer your question specifically - no it is unlikely to get pregnant while on the placebos if you have been taking the pills regularly. the timing of the placebos coincides with the period after ovulation. hence, no fertilization can occur. hope this helps. please let me know if there is anything else i can help you with. wish you good health"

a have been having a fluttering feeling in my chest that makes me feel like a need to take a big breath and it feels like my heart is skipping a beat . a am also having sharp pains in what feels like veins in my hands and a strong pulse feeling in the top of my hands . not sure what this is .,1,25338,"hello and thank you for using chat doctor. i carefully read your question and understand your concern. but you should not worry, its nothing serious. as you describe, my opinion is that it might be a rhythm issue. someone can feel strong and fast heart beats for different reasons. it may be a simple sinus tachycardia. this means that the heart is beating faster than 100 beats for minute. its normal range in a resting condition is between 60-100 beats for minute. when it goes up you may feel a strong heart beat in your chest and a sensation like your body is beating too. another reason for this sensation might be what we call an ekstrasystol.these is electrical heart impulses that generates in some parts of heart different from normal sinus rhythm. this generates an escaped beat that the person feels like jumping ore bumping. it gives the sensation like a beat is skipping, may experience palpitations or an anxiety sensation that your daughter explains like trembling. this extrasistoles may happen from different reasons from simple emotional stress to other pathologies like anemia, hyperthyroidism etc. so, my opinion as cardiologist is that you have nothing to worry. it is just a simple episode, and it is quite normal in younger ages. only if these symptoms persist and begins to interfere the daily live, if i was your treating doctor i will recommend some examinations like a blood analysis to exclude anemia, the thyroid hormones, an electrocardiogram, echocardiography and of course a holder monitoring. this will help us to document and see what happens with heart rhythm. at meantime, i will recommend your daughter to avoid coffee, caffeine products because they rise heart frequency and extrasistolic beats. i encourage her to have physical training because sometimes it helps in reducing extrasistoles, tachycardia, even making them disappear. wish i was helpful. take good care. best regards"

by sister in law suffered a massive heart attack 7 days ago . the had to be revived and want breathing for awhile . they took her off of sedation about 3 days ago but she is still on a ventilator . the has pain feeling in her feet and legs but nothing else . now long will they keep her on ventilator if she doesn't show signs of improvement .,1,30569,i think that the swollen feet are a direct function of her walking about as much as all day long possibly. because she is in the middle stages of alzheimer's she is likely not easy to keep down or to get to stay still for any length of time in order to elevate her feet. it doesn't sound as if she has a primary congestive heart problem or kidney failure from the way you're describing things. she simply walks over abundantly and does not take the time off to get her feet up. there are specific medications for alzheimer's disease (non-tremendously affective i might add) but all the same you may check with your doctor to see if any of them may be of some benefit to her in terms of getting her to be a little more settled so that she can take appropriate breaks and help the swelling of the feet down.

a am a 46 y/o female with c/o localized chest pain in the left side of my chest close but to the right of my sternum . is this cardiac pain or pectoral pain ? a feel like a can put my finger on the pain and it will just start to be noticeable for no reason . to a go see a cardiologist ? thanks !,2,44855,"greetings. welcome to chat doctor, and thank you for your question. i understand your concern. your age would help me a lot in constructing a differential diagnosis. however, i will explain some forms of chest pain, which we aim to exclude first, as the main and most dangerous organic causes of it. first, there is angina. angina is a moderate-to-severe chest pain, more characterized like a heaviness or tenderness or ""squeezing"" feeling, localized in the mid-chest, and then radiates to the both sides of the chest, the jaw, left shoulder and left arm. this is the pain originated from one or more blockages within the coronary arteries (arteries that supply the heart muscle with oxygen and nutrients). if this is your case, you should perform an ekg and an echocardiogram, and, depending on these two tests, a cardiac stress test. second, there is sharp, stabbing pain. this kind of pain can come from an enlargement of the root of the aorta and/or from aortic aneurysm. it is severe in intensity, and radiates to the back, between the wings. also, it can be caused by an acute or chronic inflammation to the linings within the rib cage, i.e. the pleura (lining of the lungs) and pericardium (the lining of the heart). this kind of pain - pleuritic pain - is less severe than that caused by aortic aneurysm, and relieves or aggravates from switching positions or the respiratory cycle. if this is the case, then echocardiogram (for pericardium and root of the aorta), chest x-ray (for the pleura and the lungs), and computed tomography of the aorta (in case we suspect that there is a problem with the aorta, higher than its root), should be performed. there is always a possibility of intercostal (between ribs) muscle or pectoral (chest) muscle soreness, and pain originated from problems with ribs and rib joints. if this is the case, you can use over the counter painkillers. i hope i was thorough with my answer. best regards."

i a am being weaned off citalopram and am on 10mg every other day and have just been put on the mini pill . a few months ago the combination made me really tearful so a came off the pill and put a halt on sex . a be gone back on the pill again and it does to seem so bad this time but is this normal ? should they effect each others effectiveness ? a don to really know what to do my up just told me to use a condom and nothing else but a a rather not take any risks .,1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"hi , its a little hard to sum up but i have been having lower stomach pains and diarrhoea for about 1 and a half months i went to the doctors and had a urine test and stool test and blood test but everything was ok. its gotten unbearable because i cant go out because i constantly need the toilet ...",1,76471,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the most common sign of pregnancy is a missed menstrual period. if you have been having unprotected sex, you are risk for pregnancy. pregnancy symptoms vary widely between women, and symptoms of breast tenderness, vaginal discharge, mood changes, spotting, bloating and the like can be present both in pregnancy and in a premenstrual state. the best way to figure out if you are pregnant or not is to perform an over-the-counter urine pregnancy test. these tests are accurate to the same degree as a urine test performed in the doctor's office, and/or positive within three weeks of conception. so in summary, if you have been having unprotected intercourse, i recommend that you perform a urine test to rule out pregnancy. if you are not pregnant, and have missed your menstrual cycle for three months, it would be prudent to see a local gun physician because hormonal imbalances and other causes may be the reason you have not menstruated for such a long time and the symptom should be evaluated. i hope that i've adequately answered your question today, and that this advice was helpful. best wishes,"

a have been diagnosed with an enlarged aorta ( also have high blood pressure and high cholesterol ) . a have read about supplements of vitamin a and omega 3 but see very different dosages suggested . now much per day is recommended of each for someone with my condition ?,2,46747,"hello, thanks for writing to chat doctor, i am chat doctor. the best option of treatment for an aortic tear, we call aortic dissection is to get a surgery done and remove that part of aorta which has a tear. along with that is very, very important to control his blood pressure to a maximum of 130 systolic, even below that. because blood pressure can cause tear to proceed further and cause more problems, even after surgery a high blood pressure causes risk of creating a new tear in the india of aorta. if religious standpoint does not allow surgery then there are very limited reliable options available, stenting has been tried, but result have been controversial. most cardiovascular interventionists prefer surgery, stents have their own problems, and they are usually ok for aortic narrowing but in a widened torn aorta they usually don't settle well and don't show good long term results. in this case scenario i would suggest that the patient should keep strict control over his blood pressure and can talk to a vascular surgeon who can do minimally invasive procedure, in this way a surgery with very little bloodshed will be possible, here i want to mention that even stenting will cause some bloodshed so for the sake of saving life this much will have to be discussed. in a nutshell, surgical repair is the best option, if the surgeon can do it with minimally invasive technique it will need much less blood loss. i hope this answered your question, if you have more queries i am happy to answer you. regards."

"a had a nexplanon place this morning , and a was told to finish my current pill pack . the told me not to have intercourse for at least a month after the pill back ended . by question is , can a still have protected intercourse between now and the time my pill pack ends ?",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

a am 20 years old and a have been taking birth control pills constantly for about a year . a never miss a dose and always take my medication on time . the medication has never affected my period and a get a heavy 5 day period every month . about 23 days ago is the last time that a had sex . a was supposed to start my period this past sunday . however a have only been having light brown spotting since tuesday . a am concerned but a never miss my birth control pills . should a be worried about pregnancy ?,1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

a shave my pubes and a couple days ago a noticed a medium sized round red irritated bump that itches and hurts when a close my legs a be had a partner for over a year but we recently split and a had sex with one other person what are my possibilities of having genital warts a be had bumps before like this but not as big as this one . this one does to show any signs of like a puss head or like a hair in it so a a scared . there a only one . me and my partner are back together of one year and he had sex with someone else too so maybe a might have caught something from him but a normally get bumps when a shave so a feel like this is a razor bump how do a know ? a take birth control and recently missed a day or two so if had some reddish discharge,1,52747,"hello, and i hope i can clarify this for you. you are absolutely correct in the fact that the length of your cycle is related to when you ovulate... and your ovulation date is 14 days back from when you got your period, rather than counting 14 days from the start of your period. it is typical for most women to have a 14-day luteal phase, as you suggested. you absolutely may ovulate later in your cycle. i do not know how long you and your partner have tried to conceive before trying closed. i would not recommend trying closed at all unless you have tried for a year (meaning unprotected sex at least 2-3 times per week) and not become pregnant. a reproductive endocrinologist is an appropriate referral if you have a history of infertility for one year, and if you fail at least 3 cycles of closed. they can prescribe closed and combine it with intrauterine insemination, which can increase the success rate. even though you may have had a child together before, there can be an issue with the male partner too, and it would be advisable he gets his sperm count evaluated. but you can still have conceived this cycle if you ovulated on the closed, and continued to have unprotected sex at least a week after your ovulation kit showed positive. your progesterone level pre-ovulation is not relevant at all. so- if you don't get a period by day 35 or so, do a pregnancy test. and if you didn't conceive this cycle, a reproductive endocrinologist might be a better choice to manage your closed. i hope this answered your question, and best of luck in getting pregnant. take care,"

"i , a actually have an orthodontic question . a had a permanent retainer on my top row of teeth . and my right side just broke . the left side is still attached , but its making eating rather difficult . a don to believe a will be able to see an orthodontist for a few days . is there anything a can do ? an a possible remove some of it so its not hanging from my teeth ?",1,26186,hi. welcome to chat doctor ... i have gone through your query and can understand your concern. as per your complaint retainer is an orthodontic appliance that is used to maintain the aligned position of the teeth after completion of the orthodontic treatment to align the teeth. if the retainer is not pressing on the teeth and has become loss it may be possibly due to movement of the teeth due to not wearing the retainer for a long time. it is of no use to wear it as until it is able to apply pressure it will not give any positive results and if you wear it there can be relapse of misalignment of teeth. you should consult your orthodontist and get evaluated for whether you further need retainer or not and if required you need to either get it adjusted or a new retainer may be needed to be fabricated for you that applies appropriate forces over the teeth and helps in maintaining its alignment. hope this information helps. thanks and regards. chat doctor. .

"by fifth toe on my right foot got caught on something and was quickly pulled away from the other toes on that foot , the toe is slightly swollen and has a bruise on the inner part . as been hurting consistently for several hours . should a wrap it up in tape ? ice it ?",1,13930,"hello, and thank you for your question. fortunately, you probably do not have fibromyalgia. there are several possible causes of pain just in the toe. if there is a pinched nerve in the lower spine, it can cause pain that can be just in one toe. if this is the case, you may find that the pain is worse with change in position, such as lying flat or standing up. pain in the toe, typically the big toe, is common in a disorder called gout, in which the body has too much uric acid. the pain usually lasts a few days at a time, and is usually associated with redness and swelling. pain in the toes can be caused by corns or other skin problems that look small but feel very severe. pins and needles, shooting, on-and-off pains can be caused by irritation to a nerve by diabetes, by lack of vitamins such as b12, or by pressure - similar to the ""foot falling asleep"" feeling we sometimes get if we cross our legs too long. fibromyalgia, on the other hand, is usually a ""pain all over"" problem - back pain, neck pain, arm pain, knee pain, without another cause such as arthritis. it usually does not cause just one part of the body to hurt - most patients say that ""everything hurts"". in my practice, i start with finding out as much as i can from the patient about how the pain feels and how long it has been going on, and if it seems related to anything else. then we examine the foot to look for anything going on with the skin, check if the nerves of the foot are normally sensitive, not as sensitive as usual, or more sensitive, and then we may check blood tests to detect diabetes or vitamin deficiency or other problems as needed. fibromyalgia is diagnosed by obtaining a careful history of where the patient is having pain, other medical problems, and completing a physical exam including what is called a ""painful point"" exam where the doctor pushes at certain places in the body - on the back and near the joints - to see if this causes pain. i hope that my answer to your question is helpful. if you have any further questions, please check back with us. i hope your toe is much better soon."

pm experiencing dull pain in the left side of my chest and my focus always seems to be on my insides like i think there something wrong with me but really nothing is it also feels at times that its hard to breath and like there a belt wrapped tightly around my head please in not sure what to do,1,52313,those are expected symptoms from the bleeding incident and some may even be side effects of the medications...hard to know for sure. it is important to always discuss possible effects of medications with the doctor who is prescribing to make sure they don't think something else could be happening. but nifedipine is commonly used in situations where bleeds occur into tissues (such as the heart in the case)...it is often used when aneurysms in the head also burst or even if there is simply a bleed secondary to the presence of amyloid commonly seen in patients with hypertension. the medication is supposed to be a preventative for spasms to be occurring in the blood vessels which can happen after a bleed and this could lead to tissue infarction. send more questions to chat doctor. so don't just top the medicine after reading this....talk it over with the doctor.

"i doc , by dad was diagnosed with uti and physician asked him to go for ultrasound . is ultrasound results shows that his right kidney is 91 * 35mms and left kidney is 97 * 40mms . the report says there is an increase in size of kidneys . hence the physician asked my dad to consult a nephrologist . would you please let me know what could be the cause for this increase in size ? and is this increase is normal with age ?",1,41308,"hi, thanks for writing in. a right kidney size of 91 x 31 mm is acceptable. a normal kidney should be measuring more than 80 mm in length and your right kidney measurement is above normal. the left kidney is usually larger in measurement than right one in everyone. the difference in size of both kidney should be within 2 cms. please do not worry about size of your kidneys. coming to your serum creatinine report a value of 1.66 is in the upper limits of normal as per some laboratories. please check with your laboratory for reference range and after discussing with your doctor, you can get it repeated at a standardized laboratory and compare serum creatinine levels. the urine culture test is normal, and you do not have any bacterial infections. you do not need any medications for that."

how can protein in urine and water retention be cured in a post kidney transplant patient ? my mother is 50 yrs old had kidney transplant 2 yrs back but now though is normal on test reports -- urine routine -- protein 4+ ( from last 4 months ) as this is little alarming so i am worried to know how to treat / control it,1,107643,"hi, kidney disease is broadly classified as two types. acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease. in aka, the chances of long term dialysis is less and patient recovers with time with normal kidney function. but in ckd, patient is on regular hemodialysis for long time or frankly say for lifetime. in that condition, we should consider kidney transplant. because dialysis is not a cure, it only prolongs the life expectancy along with some patient well-being. so for permanent cure, you have to think about kidney transplant. but kidney transplant is not so easy process. before it a battery of investigations are done to find out how is the risk benefit ratio. if all important factors are favorable then we proceed for transplant. in your case, one major risk is heart so first cardiologist asses the heart function, and then he will tell you about how risky is this process?there is no specific criteria for creatinine level for transplant. if creatinine level is stable without dialysis and patient has no symptoms then better you can wait for transplant. but if he needs regular dialysis to control creatinine level then better you think for transplant. heart failure patient can be taken for transplant if he has good ejection fraction. so you can go for kidney transplant if he has ckd with good ejection fraction of heart. thank you"

"yes greetings to all , about 6 months ago a went in for a regular check up , everything turned out good , the doctor sent me in for a prostate sonogram because there was a very small amount of blood in my urine , she mentioned it could be nothing serious but just to make sure . after the sonogram everything looked fine she said there was only a small 3 my cyst and said it was up to me if a wanted to check it out but that it looked ok. is this something a should worry about ?",1,58987,"his am chat doctor. i have read your message. i think i can help you. first, a package test means that multiple tests are included that correlate to the test. cpk and spe can both be package tests as there are many related tests needed in a diagnosis. the symptoms that you seem to be facing as per the query is basically severe backache that increases on lying down or bending-in other words, anything that causes the spine to be under pressure. now she itself can cause the symptoms. the muscles and bone problems can arise in she itself and thus possibly one will feel that there is nothing more to do. however, in many situations, the doctors may get biased my a diagnosis. so, i think it is good that your doctor did not get biased with your pre-existing diagnosis of she and continued to look for other causes of backache. a severe backache can happen due to muscle disorders, a condition known as myopathy. the cause of myopathy may be she itself. the test commonly done to test myopathy is cpk or creatine phospholipase. this is a test done from blood. the idea is if the cpk is raised, it suggests myopathy. in this situation, your doctor will need to modify the therapy. i am unaware of your medication from the query. so i cannot really comment upon it. but some medicines themselves cause myopathy. and sometimes, the dose of existing medicines need to be stepped up for treatment of myopathy. so i presume your doctor wanted to check that. second test was spe or serum protein electrophoresis. this is one of the tests for multiple myeloma. this is a type of malignancy that affects the bones and causes bone pains and should be ruled out in middle-aged to elderly commonly if the backache is worsening and is specially bad when lying down. if the test is negative, there is nothing to worry about. if it does come out to be positive, multiple myeloma can be treated. so again you need not worry since the treatment is available. why the doctor did not tell you about the tests is something i can only speculate about. i guess it was because these are just doubts, considering you already have she- in medicine, the usual dictum is that one disease can explain the symptom, the other condition should not be sought. having said that, it's a folly to miss another diagnosis due to a pre-existing condition. i think he would have told you if the tests came out positive. so there should be nothing to worry about-the doctor was just making sure that there is no other problem. possibly since there was nothing else diagnosed, he did not tell you about it. i have tried to make it as simple as possible to understand the situation. in case there are still doubts, feel free to contact me for further details. best of luck,"

a was told in the of last night that there is a lump in my lung along with severe inflammation of my respiratory system . a am waiting for the biopsy results and wondering what this could turn out to be . just trying to prepare myself for any other options than cancer .,1,33931,"hi michele jacobi the first thing that has to be done once you find a lump in the region of the chest wall is to confirm what it is. in your case a biopsy has already been done and let us await its result. you're understanding that cancerous lumps don't bleed after biopsy is correct. but i think your presumption that if it was scar tissue it would have bled is not correct. scar tissue also need not bleed. needle biopsies do not usually cause any bleeding unless a blood vessel is ruptured during the procedure since how long have you noticed this lump. is the size of the lump increasing ? if the biopsy comes as positive for cancer then you will have to undergo a series of investigation to find out he the extent of the disease. ? whether it is confined to the chest wall only or whether it has gone beyond the chest wall to other regions. treatment decision will depend on the results of this if the biopsy comes as negative for cancer then there are 2 options 1- if your physician thinks it is insignificant then you need to follow it up. just keep a check on your lump to see whether it is increasing in size and also get it checked by your physician regularly2- the second option (and my preference) is to do an open biopsy especially if the lump was detected recently and is increasing in size and also if the lump is firm to hard (and not very soft). the reason is needle biopsy can be negative, but this does not always mean there is no cancer especially if the tissue sample taken is not adequate. also time factor is important. you may lose time keeping the lump under follow up to see whether it is increasing in size hope you are satisfied with my reply. anyway don't worry. follow your doctors' advice chat doctor."

"has doctor , am trying to get pregnant.i was prescribed to take progesterone softer tablets for 15 days at night time orally.but i missed to take 1 and on the second day i got spotting and sometimes a little heavy bleeding.why ? and what should i do ? should i continue the pill ?",1,1425,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, i want to tell you that the antibiotics you took in the first pack should not interfere with the birth control you took, and the fact that you got a normal period on time means you do not have to worry about pregnancy. missing two or more pills in a row usually causes some breakthrough bleeding a few days after the missed pills, even if you make them up. this is the bleeding you are experiencing now. it most likely will stop eventually, but may continue until you finish this pack. you maximize the possibility of stopping the spotting by trying to take your pills at the same time every day. a way you can help remember your daily pill is to take it at the same time as some routine activity you do every day, for example brushing your teeth, or having a morning coffee. carrying your pills in your purse all the time can also help if you do not consistently stay in the same place every night. i hope i was able to answer your question today and that this information was helpful. best wishes,"
