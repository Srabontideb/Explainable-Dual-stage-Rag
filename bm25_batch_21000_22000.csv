key i have been experiencing numbness and pains in my head for a few weeks now and twitching in my lips and stiffness in my jaw and stabbing pains on the my right side of my chest for the last few days and have been having memory problems swell i am 18 thank you,1,16934,"dear-thanks for using chat doctor and i read your question with care. the back and neck pain is secondary to the fall and can last few days. due to the fact that you did not hit the head, we don't have to worry about a subdural or brain hematoma. however, the headache is because the acute body trauma, you can take analgesic as acetaminophen or ibuprofen for that. if your headache persists for more than 48 hrs or if you start having neurological changes as memory deficit, blurred vision or changes in the strength or numbness of your extremities, you should go to er for a ct scan of the head. otherwise, this is part of the result of a fall and should see the improvements in 72hrs. i hope that my advice has been helpful chat doctor."

(regular use of emergency pill is harmful)conception occurs if she was in 10th to 18th day of her cycle(in a regular cycle of 28 day duration). you can ask her at what day she is in and wait for next cycle to occur. if it delayed by 7 days then get done upt to diagnose if pregnant and then the required treatment can be taken. regards"

a have difficulty swallowing dry mean/dry bread . it always come back up but when it finally goes down a no longer have problems finishing the meal . a also have eczema ... a researched something called eosinophilic oesophagitis ... a condition people with eczema who usually have allergies get . is there a home remedy for this until a get to see a doctor ?,1,77921,"most people who have gallstones do not have symptoms. if you have symptoms, you most likely will have mild pain in the pit of your stomach or in the upper right part of your belly. pain may spread to your right upper back or shoulder blade area. sometimes the pain is more severe. it may be steady, or it may come and go. or it may get worse when you eat. you may decide to go to the doctor because of pain in your belly. in this case, your doctor will ask you questions about when the pain started, where it is, and if it comes and goes or is always there. your doctor may order imaging tests. these take pictures of the inside of your body. an ultrasound of the belly is the best test to find gallstones. this test does not hurt. your ultrasound may not show gallstones. but if your doctor still thinks you have a problem with your gallbladder, he or she may order a gallbladder scan. in this test, a doctor injects dye into a vein in your arm. then a machine takes x-rays as the dye moves through your liver, bile duct, gallbladder, and intestine. if you do not have symptoms, you probably do not need treatment. if your first gallstone attack causes mild pain, your doctor may tell you to take pain medicine and wait to see if the pain goes away. you may never have another attack. waiting to see what happens usually will not cause problems. if you have a bad attack, or if you have a second attack, you may want to have your gallbladder removed. a second attack means you are more likely to have future attacks. many people have their gallbladders removed, and the surgery usually goes well. doctors most often use laparoscopic surgery. for this, your surgeon will make small cuts in your belly and remove your gallbladder. you will probably be able to go back to work or your normal routine in a week or two, but it may take longer for some people. sometimes the surgeon will have to make a larger cut to remove the gallbladder. it will take longer for you to recover from this type of surgery. regards and take care"

"hi i am 35 weeks pregnant and is having high blood pressure since yesterday , i have also been coughing for a month and two weeksago was diagnosed with chest infection and have amoxicillin , this morning while coughing i noticed fresh blood , can you help",1,94539,thanks for your question on chat doctor. i can understand your concern. you are having upper lobe infection and emphysema. upper lobe infection is common with tuberculosis. you are not improving with two antibiotics (amoxicillin and levofloxacin) and still have coughing. so we should definitely rule out tuberculosis in your case. so get done sputum and bad (bronchoalveolar lavage) examination for afb (acid fast bacilli-bacteria causing tuberculosis). if both are negative then no need to worry about tuberculosis. sometimes uncontrolled emphysema can also cause coughing. so you may need inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ics) to control emphysema. so consult pulmonologist and discuss all these. hope i have solved your query. i will be happy to help you further. wish you good health. thanks.

"a am six weeks pregnant . two days ago a passed a small , light red discharge with what looked like tissue . a have not had any other symptoms since then . a called my doc and she said no big deal ... didst sound like anything to be worried about . everything online says differently . that is your opinion ?",1,78134,"hello, i went through your symptoms. there is nothing alarming, let me answer your questions one by one.1. chronic bronchitis is when you have a cough with sputum production on most days of the month for 3 months of the year for 2 consecutive years. your symptoms do not sound like chronic bronchitis.2. yes, it does sound like a bacterial infection since your symptoms have lasted for about 6.5 weeks now. green colored sputum is seen in infections caused by a bacterium called pseudocodes aeruginosa and is usually acquired from hospitals.3. since you have a sore throat, cough with sputum production for 6.5 weeks, it's likely that you have upper respiratory tract infection. 4. your symptoms could also be due to acute bronchitis. a visit to a general physician would be sufficient in my opinion. you may need to take antibiotics and cough suppressants. i hope you find the advice useful."

"a am a 20 year old girl . a have been experiencing difference in the temperatures of body parts . usually , my feet have different temperatures ; right foot colder than the left . this has also started happening with my hands now . is it something to worry about ?",1,38972,"hi, thank-you for providing the brief history of you. as you have flat feet, and using the shoe inserts though swelling is the issue now we need to have a thorough clinical examination and x-ray of the lower limb. in most cases of flat feet seen in my clinical practice have suggested understanding that the bodies natural mechanism shouldn't be altered and the change in the normal anatomy of the feet bones will lead to swelling. also, since you stand static at one place for 12 hours of work, this could be required to have a vascular insufficiency which is common in many of the cases to be assessed to rule out other conditions. also, how is your bp, dm, etc. as this is also going to play a role in your swelling. having a medial arch for the feet is not a bad thought but understanding the actual mechanism and change in the normal body due to medial arch needs a thorough understanding. as body functions as one unit one should not injure other parts of the body while treating the single joint. in my clinical practice the training of the muscles needs an attention along with the medial arch for flat foot as to balance the basic requirements of the body, so we refer to physical therapy. regards jay in chat doctor."

(hide scan) is a nuclear imaging procedure to evaluate the health and function of the gallbladder. a radioactive tracer, usually technetium-99 m, is injected through any accessible vein, then allowed to circulate to the liver, where it is excreted into the biliary system and stored by the gallbladder and biliary system. in the absence of disease, the gallbladder is visualized within 1 hour of the injection of the radioactive tracer. if the gallbladder is not visualized within 4 hours after the injection, this indicates either cholecystitis or cystic duct obstruction. so it depends on the time at which image is taken. diagnosis also varies according to the variation in image n the time of taking an image after injection of radiotracer. so your radiologist who did the procedure n saw the images of hide scan can answer your question better. i hope this will be helpful to you."

my granddaughter has had a very bad case of diarreah pale yellow and will only take in a small amount of food a day where as before was eating 3 junior size jars of baby food a day plus snacks . the has just gotten over the hands mouth and foot virus about 3 weeks ago.should she be seen by a why ?,1,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"hello dr. ira . a am at the ninth week of pregnancy and the doctor says that he does to hear the baby a heart beat . since this is my second pregnancy , a was wondering if there is any chance that he might be wrong or if there are case in which you can to hear the heart beat . thank you .",1,106734,"hello. thank you for your question and welcome to chat doctor. i carefully read your query. this extra heart beat, with the highest probability, is what we call extrasystole (a skipped heart beat). it is a premature heart beat that is generated from another area of the heart, not from the normal pacemaker of the heart. after this, there is a pause, as the heart ""resets"" and the next beat if more forceful and perceived from the individual experiencing it. this is called a palpitation. they can happen when you are tired, when you exerted vigorously, when you have had alcoholic beverages, and they can happen to anyone. in most of the cases, they are totally benign. however, it is not a good sign if they happen often. therefore, i would recommend you a 24-hour holder rhythm monitor, to check how many times these phenomena happen throughout a day, and if they exceed the ""normal"" limit, proper treatment should be started. my opinion is that you should not hold back from everyday activity. i hope i was helpful with my answer. wish you a good health. best regards,"

i i am a 44yr old female & i have a dull aching pain on my right side that seems to go from front to the back ... it started when the skin on my back ( just where you would put you hands on your hip ) became sensitive to touch ( & still is ) .... i also feel bloated and constipated ... live been awake with it all night ... can you help please ? a thought it might have been appendicitis but the pain has remained constant and not sharp ! ! !,1,56450,"hello, sorry to hear that our team in the medical was not able to help you out. it would have been perfect if you had mentioned the details of the mri reports as we could have understood something from it. if you have any issue with the intervertebral disc and nerve entrapment. now since you are mentioning pain in the hip, thigh, leg and back, i would like to know if the pain symptom is radiating in nature? also, how is the back pain? is the nature of the pain sharp shooting or dull aching. if dull aching then it will be related to muscle but if sharpshooting than it will be for nerve. now coming to an analysis of you, you mentioned your age is 38, so we can look for some degenerative changes in the lumbar spine. due to which there might be changes of back pain and nerve getting trapped. for this i will recommend you to try out the exercise for the core, back and lower limbs on both sides. it is mandatory to do exercise in any back pains or radiating pains as due to pain there is a muscle weakness which gets build up over a period of time and once the muscles are weak there is instability of the spinal column. i wish you check for your blood glucose levels along with uric acid too, so we can have a differential diagnosis made to rule out the possibility because. if you can still mention in detail about the mri it will be really kind of you. in my clinical practice of over 12 years, many back cases associated with leg pain are doing well with conservative management. like - exercise, physical therapy and yoga. outcome score is almost as desired to be. please start the exercise, and you will get a difference in the overall physical well-being. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further. take care jay in chat doctor."

"when a was younger a was diagnosed with a heart murder . in recent times , a be discovered that sometimes ( usually when a a stressed ) my heart gets extremely tight and feels like it a being squeezed . it a not happening in my whole chest , it a very centralized . a be also had a couple recent experiences where it happens and in addition the pain kind of spreads across my chest and in my arm . not sure if this is related . is this reason to consult my doctor and have anything looked at ?",1,25338,"hello and thank you for using chat doctor. i carefully read your question and understand your concern. but you should not worry, its nothing serious. as you describe, my opinion is that it might be a rhythm issue. someone can feel strong and fast heart beats for different reasons. it may be a simple sinus tachycardia. this means that the heart is beating faster than 100 beats for minute. its normal range in a resting condition is between 60-100 beats for minute. when it goes up you may feel a strong heart beat in your chest and a sensation like your body is beating too. another reason for this sensation might be what we call an ekstrasystol.these is electrical heart impulses that generates in some parts of heart different from normal sinus rhythm. this generates an escaped beat that the person feels like jumping ore bumping. it gives the sensation like a beat is skipping, may experience palpitations or an anxiety sensation that your daughter explains like trembling. this extrasistoles may happen from different reasons from simple emotional stress to other pathologies like anemia, hyperthyroidism etc. so, my opinion as cardiologist is that you have nothing to worry. it is just a simple episode, and it is quite normal in younger ages. only if these symptoms persist and begins to interfere the daily live, if i was your treating doctor i will recommend some examinations like a blood analysis to exclude anemia, the thyroid hormones, an electrocardiogram, echocardiography and of course a holder monitoring. this will help us to document and see what happens with heart rhythm. at meantime, i will recommend your daughter to avoid coffee, caffeine products because they rise heart frequency and extrasistolic beats. i encourage her to have physical training because sometimes it helps in reducing extrasistoles, tachycardia, even making them disappear. wish i was helpful. take good care. best regards"

"hello , in 17 & i started using the birth control patch tho via to regulate my irregular period . a started yesterday & live been on it for two days now & i have been feeling nauseous and with strong back pain that i cant stand or sit for a long period of time . is this normal to have strong back pain from this birth control ? a haven had my period in 2 months so my doctor proscribed hormonal birth control to help my system i hope i can have a regular period soon . any thoughts if this is normal ? ?",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

(would you be having it then?) now your cycle is of 30 days period. so the expected date of ovulation should be 07 january. hence, if the conception takes place on 07 january, the due date of delivery would be 30 september. the hitch here is that you should have ovulation taking lace on 07 january. moreover, we have noticed that all the pregnancies do not last for 280 days. the delivery can take place any time between 3 weeks earlier to 1 week later than the expected due date of delivery. keeping these facts and calculations in mind, you may plan your sexual relations accordingly. i hope this will help you."

"hello there .. i need an advice on presa news , what time of period should we have to take presa news for test .. i mean me and my partner have an doubt , that we are unable to take that much precaution to avoid pregnancy .. now my question is , we have mingled tomorrow , and i want sure result about my partner pregnancy test.can she use it today in morning , is that much time gap enough for test .",1,40763,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the clearblue test is not very accurate in predicting gestational age. the amount of pregnancy hormone in a women urine can vary depending on the time of day she did the test and how much water she had to chat doctor. furthermore, many women have some bleeding in the first trimester of pregnancy, so the bleeding she had in december and january may not have been her real period at all. the most accurate way to test the age of a pregnancy, is an ultrasound exam to measure the fetus. this is normally done during the course of her routine prenatal care. an ultrasound is also necessary to determine if there is more than one fetus present. in your sisters case, if she conceived in november, the measurements of her uterus at this point would be accurate. so i would recommend that she have an ultrasound exam (which i am sure will be done soon as part of her routine prenatal care) to confirm her due date and the viability of the pregnancy. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes to your sister for her pregnancy,"

by husband was due to have surgery recently and it was cancelled at the last minute due to his heart medication . be recently had 2 stents in his heart . it has something to do with platelets and has been told he will have to wait 6 months until he can operation ( elective surgery on foot ) an you please explain . regards judy,3,105897,"hi. to begin with, the treatment that your husband has undergone seems to be correct medically, more or less. to begin with he was suffering from locally advanced prostate cancer which was downstage and then surgically removed. however, he had a relapse of his disease in the bones and was placed on hormonal treatment. he seemed to be suffering from hormone resistant prostate cancer which can occur in 10% patients to start with. thus, he failed to respond to most of the treatments and eventually died of his disease. at every stage of progression, doing a scan is not mandatory. just a rising psa and symptoms are enough to know that the disease is progressing. doing a scan only documents that the disease has spread to a particular part. it will neither change the treatment nor the outcome. the blood was basically because of 2 reasons. one the disease in the lung which can commonly lead to bleeding on its own of varying quantity. added to that was the fact that he was in liver failure which further increases the chances of bleeding from any site. zynga has many side effects and one has to weigh the risks against the benefits and take a call. i assume, and you should to that the call to give zynga despite liver failure by your doctor was in good faith and based on sound judgement. i think the only part where your doctor failed you entirely was by not keeping you informed at every step the prognosis, the treatment options, the disease status and the likely outcome. it is something that i would have done and is nothing but unfortunate. while it would not have changed the outcome of your husband, it might have left you in peace after his demise. hope my answer takes care of your unrest in some measure, and you find strength enough to move on in life. take care"

2 months ago a was diagnosed with low platelet count . was sent to the dermatologist and all they keep doing is rechecking my platelet count and not doing any treatment . last month started having chest pain thought it could be due to the low platelet . went to of they could not find anything . my regular doctor sent me to have stress test the first one came back slightly abnormal in the nuclear stress test came back normal . did not have no chest pain when having both tests done . today a have had burning in my chest off and on and overtime get the burning in chest also get a pain close to my left wrist,1,72978,"hi ! good morning. i am chat doctor answering your query. i am not aware if an intestinal mucosa biopsy was done during the endoscopy and colonoscopy or not, which was a must. if done, you did not mention the report of the biopsy. when all the tests mentioned by you came out to be normal, this compels me to think of possibility of celiac disease/gluten sensitivity which goes very often unsuspected and missed, specially if your daughter was used to eat fried, oily, and fast food from outside. this is not easy to diagnose, and the best way is to exclude all kinds of fast food you consume in outside eating joints. gluten sensitivity could give rise to all the symptoms you have described including your weight loss, abdominal pain, nausea, and over and above, low platelet count which might have resulted in the bruises. a platelet count and clotting profile is indicated in this case. it is usually not thought of and is under diagnosed. also, if you are from a developing country, tuberculosis not infrequently could give rise to such symptoms of your daughter. i suggest you to consult a gastroenterologist along with a dietician on this aspect of the diagnosis, which possibly might not have been considered until now. the gastroenterologist will be able to diagnose with few biochemical tests along with a possible repeat endoscopy with biopsy of the intestinal mucosal wall, while the dietician can guide you on your daughters' food that she can consume pleasantly. i hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts. thanks for choosing chat doctor to clear doubts on your health problems. i wish you an early recovery. chat doctor."

had tooth out this monday as had bad infection under tooth . have rinsed with warm salt water every 4 hours and used corsodyl daily as advised after brushing and meals . but tonight checked the area where the tootchatdoctore out and found a brown meaty looking lump that has given me concerns as i know this is not food as have made sure to not chew on this side of the mouth and wondering if there is cause for concern .,1,110385,"hello and thank you for your question. what you had pop out was either the blood clot that had formed when you had the tooth extracted or old food debris. this is the same way the other parts of your body shed a scab. this one happened to be in your mouth. you are experiencing the sensitivity and throbbing because now you have raw tissue exposed to the outside environment. this is a normal part of healing. i would suggest rinsing your mouth out with warm salt water to help keeping the area clean and reduce the swelling. 10oz warm water, 1/2 tsp salt swish and spit 4-6 times a day especially after eating. also, you can take nsaids such as ibuprofen, at this point i would take 600 mg every 6 hours as needed for pain. if the pain continues or gets worse, go into your dentist to be evaluated for infection formation. best wishes and good health"

"i , i did have a miscarriage and took the pill on may 30th . the bleeding was heavy the first 15 days , then a only had brown spots till the middle of june when everything stopped . the end of june the brown spots appeared again and only one day a did have blood . now , a have brown discharges and sometimes they are yellow . is something a have to worry about ?",1,88474,"hallow dear, doing pregnancy test on urine on 2nd june after having sex on 1st june was too early for detection of pregnancy. these tests give reliable tests when the conception is 3 weeks or more old; i.e. about 8-10 days after missed period. so you should have done it after 21st june. you were expecting your period on 12th. it means your egg release was due on 30th may. egg has life of 24 hours and the sperms are active for 72 hours. in short, your intercourse was on very fertile day. so it is most likely that you were pregnant. it is likely that severe abdominal pain followed by brown bleeding and then subsequently heavy bleeding is due to the abortion process. if the clots you passed contained some white clots also, it means they are products of conception. the best option for you is to undergo ultrasonography. this will reveal whether you have any products of conception still left in the uterine cavity or whether the cavity is empty. if some products are still in the cavity (incomplete abortion), you may have to undergo surgical evacuation of the uterus. if there is any evidence of blood in the pelvic cavity, you have to keep the possibility of the pregnancy outside the uterine cavity (ectopic pregnancy) in mind. this is a very serious bleeding emergency and calls for immediate medical help with blood transfusion. so please report to your gynecologist for appropriate diagnosis and management if required. i hope this helps you."

"hello , it has been over 3 years since live been to the dentist for a check up , i have had teeth problems in the past which required me to wear braces as well as get fillings , however i stopped going for check ups which in hind sight was wrong but i just totally forgot to make an appointment . recently though i have noticed a hole in one of my upper front teeth which has turned black ... is there a chance they can save my tooth or will it have to be removed ?",1,78347,"hello, i can understand your concern and think of two possibilities for the grayish line you have described on the front teeth. firstly, if you took iron supplements during pregnancy or after childbirth, it may have entered the children bloodstream in uterus or through breast milk. the front teeth are developing in the uterus and matures in bone during initial months after birth, which may cause development of such lines. however, if this was the case, the line should have been present when the tooth erupted into oral cavity. as she has history of falling, it is quite a possibility that she may have damaged her front teeth. the teeth may not break or crack, but the pulp inside the tooth may have died making the tooth appear dark. invariably, this pulp would be infected and should be treated as the tooth is going to stay in oral cavity till your daughter ages 8-9 years. if this is the case, then she might need to go for lumpectomy procedure for the affected teeth. one more possibility is presence of plaque on the teeth due to inadequate oral hygiene and lack of proper tooth brushing. this can be removed by ultrasonic scaling procedure performed by the dentist in any case, i would recommend you to visit a dentist for examination of the line as confirmed diagnosis can be made only after physically looking at the teeth and the line you have described. if it is developmental, then no treatment is needed, and it will be gone with the milk tooth shedding. in case of any other reason, treatment will be required as described. i hope this information helps you. thank you for choosing chat doctor. take care. best,"

"been having left side chest pain for over a year . main gets worse when laying on my stomach and subsides when standing . main will last anywhere between 3 min and 10 hours . had an ekg , heart ultrasound and holder monitor with no signs of heart issues . tried many antacids with no response to them . main is not influenced with exercise . have mad multiple blood tests all showing normal . forcing gas out as what feels like an inside burp seems to relieve some of the pain.pushing on my left rib cage and breast also seem to help .",1,44855,"greetings. welcome to chat doctor, and thank you for your question. i understand your concern. your age would help me a lot in constructing a differential diagnosis. however, i will explain some forms of chest pain, which we aim to exclude first, as the main and most dangerous organic causes of it. first, there is angina. angina is a moderate-to-severe chest pain, more characterized like a heaviness or tenderness or ""squeezing"" feeling, localized in the mid-chest, and then radiates to the both sides of the chest, the jaw, left shoulder and left arm. this is the pain originated from one or more blockages within the coronary arteries (arteries that supply the heart muscle with oxygen and nutrients). if this is your case, you should perform an ekg and an echocardiogram, and, depending on these two tests, a cardiac stress test. second, there is sharp, stabbing pain. this kind of pain can come from an enlargement of the root of the aorta and/or from aortic aneurysm. it is severe in intensity, and radiates to the back, between the wings. also, it can be caused by an acute or chronic inflammation to the linings within the rib cage, i.e. the pleura (lining of the lungs) and pericardium (the lining of the heart). this kind of pain - pleuritic pain - is less severe than that caused by aortic aneurysm, and relieves or aggravates from switching positions or the respiratory cycle. if this is the case, then echocardiogram (for pericardium and root of the aorta), chest x-ray (for the pleura and the lungs), and computed tomography of the aorta (in case we suspect that there is a problem with the aorta, higher than its root), should be performed. there is always a possibility of intercostal (between ribs) muscle or pectoral (chest) muscle soreness, and pain originated from problems with ribs and rib joints. if this is the case, you can use over the counter painkillers. i hope i was thorough with my answer. best regards."

by other who is 50 yrs old is having of 100/140.doctor has observed unspecified changes in her ecg and has recommended tmt test . may a know the preparations or precautions to be taken before the test . the is also suffering from thyroid . her angiography was already done in of pgi lucknow .,1,105243,"hellothanks for posting at chat doctor. your wife has symptoms of chest pain and discomfort on exertion which are very typical for angina sectors or ischemic heart disease. this means there are some blocks in the heart arteries. when a patient with such blocks walks or exercises, the heart rate increases and its blood and oxygen demand increases. since the arteries are blocked, they cannot cope up with the extra demand of blood and oxygen while exercising or walking. this causes the chest pain/discomfort. this same principle is used in a tmt. you are made to exercise on a treadmill while your ecg is continuously being recorded to see whether the ecg shows changes while walking corresponding to her chest pain. hence, it is called provocable ischemia since we provoke the event. before a tmt, a target heart rate is set for the patient till which the patient is usually made to walk on the treadmill. this target heart rate is usually 220 - age of the patient. your wives tmt showed changes of ischemia or deficiency in blood supply at 74% of this target heart rate. hence, this is a positive test and indicates a strong possibility of blockages in the heart in view of typical symptoms and a positive tmt. your cardiologist will advise a coronary angiography for her which is an invasive test done through a small hole in the hand or the leg. this will show the blockages in the heart and their severity. on basis of the angiography findings, further treatment (medical management vs angioplasty vs bypass) can be discussed. my feeling is she would require an angioplasty. please go ahead with an angiography and revert with the findings. wishing her good healthregards"

a have had 3 vertebral subluxations from an accident in 2001 . a am wondering if the pain a have experiencing more and more is considered chronic or not . a have not had any help with it for years and it seems it a getting worse . a don to want to take pain pills for it either,1,26171,"i read your question and i understand your concern. generally speaking vertebral fusion is a predisposing factor for back pain because the limited mobility between the fused vertebrae means more strain to other vertebral levels which do suffer degenerative changes in time.however, it would be a gradual process due to vertebral change with the passing of the years, so if it started acutely only after the accident then it is not the only cause. although no visible fracture, other supportive components of the spine such joints, ligaments, muscles have been affected by the accident but don't need specific treatment apart from painkillers and muscle relaxants and hopefully will gradually heal in time. i hope to have been of help."

"a take movicol once a day . a am on pregabalin and amatriptoline because i suffer from chronic pain . a previously took diclophenac , a had to stop because of the side effects on my stomach . a now take omeprazole for my stomach as a think a had/have a stomach ulcer . would the movicol contribute to sore stomachs ?",1,97433,"hi, after reviewing your question i assume you mean a positive breath test for h. pylori? i am sorry to hear the amount of discomfort that you've been through. this is how i would proceed to look at your case:1. your symptoms are very peculiar for peptic ulcer disease or gastritis. both are different ways of getting damage done to your stomach. an ulcer is like a crater which may or may not be prone to bleeding. gastritis is a bit like having multiple pinpoint sore spots, causing pain and discomfort. a positive breath test may mean that you have h. pylori infection. as uncomfortable as this is, it is usually very treatable. were you on many painkillers because of the spinal fusion? if yes, then they would certainly have contributed. 2. i don't think a mask has anything to do with this. a sterile nasogastric tube taken out of the bag is very unlikely to bring infection to the insides of the stomach. nasogastric tubes, however, do cause a bit of irritation in the stomach lining. while they could have a very small contribution, i doubt they have had a significant effect. 3. the problem at hand seems to be the h. pylori infection which is a bacterial infection of the stomach lining which causes wear and tear in the stomach. this bug is acquired by the orofacial route. what this means is that someone with h. pylori sheds the bacteria through their stools. sometimes, because of poor hand hygiene, they may pass it on to others, especially through food. the new victim ingests these bugs and in this way h. pylori finds a new home to infest. i don't think your husband having a breath test will add to anything if he does not have symptoms. 4. an unintentional weight loss may signify a gastric ulcer (in opposition to peptic ulcer)5. you may benefit from a look down into the stomach through gastrostomy. it will give a great deal of information. your weight loss is also an indication of getting you a ct scan of the abdomen to ensure that there is nothing dangerous in play. 6. treatment would include amoxicillin, azithromycin and an acid tablet such as omeprazole for a 10 to 14-day course. since these recommendations include a gastrostomy, you will eventually have to visit a physician or a gastroenterologist to have it done. gastroenterologists are also excellent at managing h. pylori infections, along with ulcers and gastritis."

"a had my last period on time , started my new pack of pills on sunday and everything was fine . when a missed 2 pills and began having brown discharge . now it is time for me to have my period again , a am on the placebo week . should a start a new pack ? or continue wait ?",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"yesterday a noticed a fairly large soft lump just below my knee cap . there is no pain or redness , and a had not bumped it . when a woke from sleep the lump had decreased in size , but once up and walking around , it came back . that do you think is the problem ?",1,33931,"hi michele jacobi the first thing that has to be done once you find a lump in the region of the chest wall is to confirm what it is. in your case a biopsy has already been done and let us await its result. you're understanding that cancerous lumps don't bleed after biopsy is correct. but i think your presumption that if it was scar tissue it would have bled is not correct. scar tissue also need not bleed. needle biopsies do not usually cause any bleeding unless a blood vessel is ruptured during the procedure since how long have you noticed this lump. is the size of the lump increasing ? if the biopsy comes as positive for cancer then you will have to undergo a series of investigation to find out he the extent of the disease. ? whether it is confined to the chest wall only or whether it has gone beyond the chest wall to other regions. treatment decision will depend on the results of this if the biopsy comes as negative for cancer then there are 2 options 1- if your physician thinks it is insignificant then you need to follow it up. just keep a check on your lump to see whether it is increasing in size and also get it checked by your physician regularly2- the second option (and my preference) is to do an open biopsy especially if the lump was detected recently and is increasing in size and also if the lump is firm to hard (and not very soft). the reason is needle biopsy can be negative, but this does not always mean there is no cancer especially if the tissue sample taken is not adequate. also time factor is important. you may lose time keeping the lump under follow up to see whether it is increasing in size hope you are satisfied with my reply. anyway don't worry. follow your doctors' advice chat doctor."

a am 36years old male.i am having pain in my chest-just to the left of my chest inside 2nd rib bone from top.sometime the pain is around 3-4 rib bone.it from the front and sometime from the back.i have severe gastric.some time i feel ball of air just above stomach to the left . might there be connection between the pain and gastric.toady i am having continuous pain at the said point.thank you .,1,41649,"hello. thank you for your question and welcome to chat doctor. i understand your concern. well, i am going to try and explain the differences between various origins of the pain which can arise from the rib cage. there is angina. it is described more like mid-chest heaviness or squeezing sensation, that is triggered by exercise and relieved by rest, which radiates to the both sides of the chest, to the jaw and left arm and shoulder. it is indicative of a blockage within one or more coronary arteries and reflects the lowering of blood supply to the heart muscle. an ekg obtained in the moment of chest pain, if it fills this description, would be helpful. then there is pleuritic chest pain. this kind of pain is sharp, stabbing pain that can happen in any part of the chest area. no radiation like in anginal pain. it arises from acute or chronic inflammation of the linings that are within the rib cage: pleura (lining of the lungs) or pericardium (lining of the heart) or both. in this regard, i would recommend a chest x-ray for pleural inflammation or effusion. in case of pericardial pain and anginal pain, echocardiogram is helpful, by evaluating the size, motility and function of heart muscle and valves, and also by assessing the pericardium and whether there is fluid build-up within it, or not. other causes of chest pain are related to the locomotion system of the rib cage: muscle soreness, bone and cartilage-related pain. in the end, stress can also cause chest pain. i hope i was helpful with my answer. best regards,"

i . i would like to ask . be and my girlfriend have unprotected sex during the 7th and 8th day after her period . a just penetrate not more than 1.5cm till 2cm inside and a absolutely did not ejaculate inside her . that is her chance of getting pregnancy ?,1,102839,"hi, i guess your concern is about getting pregnant of your girlfriend from pre-ejaculatory liquid near vagina. so my straight forward answer is, yes. there are chances but it's very, very less to getting her pregnant. usually chances of getting pregnant is more when ejaculation occurs when penis is inside the vagina. but in your case as you told that your penis did not go inside the vagina, and you were just rubbing it against her outer vagina. so there is very, very less chance of getting pregnant. so don't worry, relax. you also told that u didn't have condom on that time. and there is pre-ejaculation occurs around her vagina. so there is little chances having for getting pregnant. for that you do not need to take tension because your girlfriend can use emergency contraceptive pill (i-pill) within 72 hrs of unprotected intercourse. as told by you that you people had intercourse 2 days ago. so there is sufficient time to take emergency contraception. this is usually available your nearby medical store at affordable prices. with this above discussion you can try out my suggestions-1. don't waste time and get the i-pill as early as possible. ask your girlfriend to take it. wait till her next menses. if she gets menses on her expected or delay date, she will not be pregnant. 2. you can do urinary pregnancy test after 5-6 days of her missed period. it is available at affordable prices your nearby medical store. buy it and ask your girlfriend to do it by herself. if it is negative, she's not pregnant. if it is positive visit to nearby gynecologist for further help. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further. chat doctor."

a was hit in the face on friday . there was significant swelling and now most of it has gone down and it is just black . there is numbness in the cheek down towards my mouth . a was looking into blowout fractures of the orbit but i don to think that is the case here cause there is no double vision or sinking of the eye right now . any possible explanations ?,1,37966,"hit hanks for the query. as per your explanation of symptoms and location of the swelling as you told that it is located right under the jaw shows that the lump is due to swelling in the sub mandibular salivary gland which is located just below the lower jaw. the swelling can be due to obstruction in the ducts of the salivary gland due to formation of crystalline stones in the ducts of the gland, and they are formed from the minerals present in the saliva. it leads to back flow of saliva into the gland leading to swelling. it can also be due to formation of cysts or tumors into the glands. it can also be due to infection in the gland, but an infection most commonly causes painful and tender swelling. if there is already any infection in any part of the mouth, face or any other body part and if the swelling is round and mobile can be mostly a lymph node swelling.you need not get panic as it is most commonly a non-cancerous swelling. i would suggest you to consult an oral pathologist and get evaluated for the exact cause of the swelling and get treated. obstruction in the ducts can be cleared by locating and removing the stones either by palpating and pushing the stone towards canal opening and in case of large stones a small incision placed inside mouth and stone is removed. infections in gland or lymph nodes can be treated by antibiotics. hope this helps. regards."

"hello , question can a gum infection make your nose feel numb . only one side of my nose feels numb and a few months ago when a had my wisdom tooth removed before that procedure my nose felt slightly numb . would this be a sign of a gum or tooth infection ?",1,5711,hi. thanks for the query as per your complaint sore throat can be seen associated with wisdom tooth related infection and inflammation as the area of wisdom teeth is very close to throat and inflammation from wisdom tooth can even make the throat sore and painful. but runny nose is not commonly seen with sore throat if it is related to wisdom tooth and can be due to other causes like sinus infection or upper respiratory infection. so for this you can consult a physician and get evaluated. for tender gum around wisdom tooth that seems to be due to peritonitis which is inflammation of gum flap due to food accumulation and infection between gum flap and tooth. whether tooth is impacted or not can be ruled out with x-ray. for this consult an oral physician and get evaluated and an x-ray of the tooth will be done.first to reduce infection the area will be irrigated with antiseptic solution followed by a course of antibiotics like augmenting and anti-inflammatory painkillers like ibuprofen. warm saline gargle will also help. once the inflammation reduce then if the wisdom tooth is not impacted then it will be left to erupt. in case if the tenderness recurs then the gum flap will be removed to prevent recurrence. if the tooth is impacted then extraction is the best line of treatment. hope this helps. regards.
"hello , question can a gum infection make your nose feel numb . only one side of my nose feels numb and a few months ago when a had my wisdom tooth removed before that procedure my nose felt slightly numb . would this be a sign of a gum or tooth infection ?",2,103470,"thanks for your query, i have gone through your query. the swollen gums can be because of the deposits below the gum resulting in gum infection, or it can be from the erupting wisdom tooth causing gum infection(peritonitis). if it is because of the deposits, get your teeth cleaned. consult an oral physician and get a radiograph done to rule the amount of space present for the tooth to erupt if space is there for the tooth to erupt then the gum covering over the wisdom tooth can be removed. if the space is not available then you have to get the wisdom tooth removed. meanwhile you can take a course of antibiotics like amoxicillin and metronidazole for 5 days (if you are not allergic). do saline gargling. i hope my answer will help you, take care."
"hello , question can a gum infection make your nose feel numb . only one side of my nose feels numb and a few months ago when a had my wisdom tooth removed before that procedure my nose felt slightly numb . would this be a sign of a gum or tooth infection ?",3,95182,"hello, yes, you could have a condition of peritonitis. you are describing a difficult location to clean, and may have had some tartar along with inflamed tissue there. do not chew on this side of your mouth to avoid getting anything caught in the pocket between the gum and the tooth. i would suggest vigorous rinsing and continue gentle cleaning. warm salt water used multiple times a day is an excellent choice. you can take some pain relief and anti-inflammatory medication. tissue is more fragile if inflamed, so it can be traumatic with escaping of this unhealthy tissue causing bleeding and possible slight ripping. this should resolve if you keep the area clean to allow it to heal. if the tissue does not start to feel better and seem closer to the gum soon, you will need to return to the dentist to evaluate. if symptoms get worse, especially swelling, see the dentist. antibiotics may be required. it is possible there is some tartar deep under the gum that could not be removed with a simple cleaning or something afterwards has gotten caught below the gum. a deep scaling while numb may be required to clean deeper into the pocket. probing the area determines a measurement which will help determine if the area is able to heal, tissue needs to be removed or extraction of the wisdom tooth should be considered. if your wisdom tooth is in the process of erupting, or you do not have room for the tooth to fully erupt out of the tissue, you have a situation that can reoccur. i hope this answer is helpful to you. i would be glad to discuss your situation further if you have any additional details or questions. thank you for your inquiry."
