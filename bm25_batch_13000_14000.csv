"a have episodes or spells to where a numbness tingling that goes from my head to my arms all the way to finger tips but no further not below chest area then pass out live had two or three episodes where my daughter in law finds me in floor , then i have diarrhoea and vomiting after or while in out i have diarrhoea",1,34928,"hello. welcome to chat doctor, and thank you for your question. i understand your concern. pain in the chest can have different origins, which include also the locomotion system, i.e. muscles, joints and ribs. now, every time we work out, even if we do not include the between rib (intercostal) muscles, suffices that we have heavy breathing and this can cause intercostal muscle soreness, which is mostly reflected as pain. if you try to cough, and you get the pain, then it is probably this diagnosis. as all other episodes with muscle soreness, no special treatment is required, as it goes away in few days. according to your age, my opinion is that cardiac and pulmonary origin of this pain is less likely. however, just to be secure and ""in the safe"", i would recommend you to do an ekg, as there sometimes are inflammations of cardiac lining (pericardium) which do not have an age predilection and can happen in all ages, especially after an episode with flu or other forms of infection. just to be clear, my suspicion that this is the case is very low, but i recommended the ekg to securely exclude this as an origin of your pain. as about the waves of dizziness, i would be more comfortable answering this question if i had more details, because dizziness is a symptom that may have various origins. it probably is, in this case, from over loading of physical activity and, in this case, no further examination is required. i would recommend you to take two to three days off from working out, and see if these bouts of dizziness happen again. i hope this helps. take care. best regards,"

in two and half months pregnant and have a serious head cold . ave had it for over a month now and doesn't seem to be getting better . by nose is either constantly or running . a was just wondering if there was anything i could take to help relieve some of the pain and discomfort .,1,77227,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, i want to clarify, if you are virgin and have not had sexual intercourse or ejaculation directly in the opening of your vagina, your chance of pregnancy is really nonexistent. sperm die when exposed to air, so there is no way that you can become pregnant from sperm that ejaculated outside the vagina. furthermore, is very uncommon to find women who ovulate during their menstrual cycle. therefore, you were most likely not at the fertile time of your cycle when you and your boyfriend had genital contact. furthermore, irregular bleeding can be caused by travel, changes in weight, hormonal imbalances and stress, especially the stress of worrying about getting pregnant. just because your period was light this month does not mean that there was anything wrong. now omens menstrual cycle is exactly the same every month, and as long as you got a period at the usual time, there is no reason to suspect pregnancy if the bleeding was different in quality than what you usually see. so i think that it is fine to be reassured that you did not conceive from this encounter with your boyfriend. if you continue to have irregular menstrual cycles for more than three months, you may want to visit your local physician as some hormonal imbalances can cause these problems and should be tested for. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was reassuring. best wishes,"

"hi , a have a question , what could that be and what a should do about it ? by toes , rather between toes on one foot , the center of my palms , the back of the neck , where neck meets head get very itchy every day . ave had this condition on and off for a few years , but now it became unbearable . would that be an allergy , lack of vitamins ? please , help . thank you",1,13930,"hello, and thank you for your question. fortunately, you probably do not have fibromyalgia. there are several possible causes of pain just in the toe. if there is a pinched nerve in the lower spine, it can cause pain that can be just in one toe. if this is the case, you may find that the pain is worse with change in position, such as lying flat or standing up. pain in the toe, typically the big toe, is common in a disorder called gout, in which the body has too much uric acid. the pain usually lasts a few days at a time, and is usually associated with redness and swelling. pain in the toes can be caused by corns or other skin problems that look small but feel very severe. pins and needles, shooting, on-and-off pains can be caused by irritation to a nerve by diabetes, by lack of vitamins such as b12, or by pressure - similar to the ""foot falling asleep"" feeling we sometimes get if we cross our legs too long. fibromyalgia, on the other hand, is usually a ""pain all over"" problem - back pain, neck pain, arm pain, knee pain, without another cause such as arthritis. it usually does not cause just one part of the body to hurt - most patients say that ""everything hurts"". in my practice, i start with finding out as much as i can from the patient about how the pain feels and how long it has been going on, and if it seems related to anything else. then we examine the foot to look for anything going on with the skin, check if the nerves of the foot are normally sensitive, not as sensitive as usual, or more sensitive, and then we may check blood tests to detect diabetes or vitamin deficiency or other problems as needed. fibromyalgia is diagnosed by obtaining a careful history of where the patient is having pain, other medical problems, and completing a physical exam including what is called a ""painful point"" exam where the doctor pushes at certain places in the body - on the back and near the joints - to see if this causes pain. i hope that my answer to your question is helpful. if you have any further questions, please check back with us. i hope your toe is much better soon."

(as you said he has difficulty in walking now). you can also say to his parents that --- they can continue with all religious customs along with medicines, may be then they will agree... with medicine, he will start showing improvement in few days only... it is psychosis and patients will not agree to go to any doctor willingly, so you might need to take him forcefully. this is well accepted as it is for his benefit only. even if he doesn't agree for oral medicine there are injectables which are given to such patients... take the right step, take him to a doctor. hope the reply is useful feel free to ask more questions"

(as you said he has difficulty in walking now). you can also say to his parents that --- they can continue with all religious customs along with medicines, may be then they will agree... with medicine, he will start showing improvement in few days only... it is psychosis and patients will not agree to go to any doctor willingly, so you might need to take him forcefully. this is well accepted as it is for his benefit only. even if he doesn't agree for oral medicine there are injectables which are given to such patients... take the right step, take him to a doctor. hope the reply is useful feel free to ask more questions"

had my id taken out first day of my period last month my period then only lasted 2days which is short compared to the usual 5-7 days ... had unprotected sex approx 4 times since and about a week ago started having classic pregnancy symptoms .... book a test 3 days ago in the morning with neg results then later that day started period . last normal from the start ... had thick stringy mucus when going to the bathroom that was so thick it wouldn't come out until a had to wipe it away ... thus went on the whole first day with nothing in the pad ... second day was normal flow and day 3 nothing but when wiping just on tissue ... would pregnancy be possible ? still having all the symptoms,1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"pm 29 years old male and had a recent cat can show that : calculus at the upper portion of the left kidney , measuring 1mm . to hydronephrosis or renal mass . unremarkable ureters and urinary bladder . that does this mean ?",2,34445,"hi, thanks for writing in. the collecting system of the kidney is made of renal calyxes and pelvis. this collects the urine formed in kidney and transports it through the ureter (tubes connecting kidneys and urinary bladder) to the urinary bladder. the pelvicalyceal system is the mouth of the kidney where it connects with the upper end of the ureter. i guess that you have got ultrasound scan done, and it shows mild fullness of the pelvicalyceal system in the left kidney, that is a term applied to increase in diameter of the collecting system in your left kidney. it is not a critical situation, and please do not worry if you do not have any urinary symptoms. since it is mentioned as mild fullness and no kidney stones have been found, therefore(i) it can be that your bladder was completely full at the of ultrasound scan(ii) your kidney pelvicalyceal system is appearing full by itself (extrarenal pelvis) and is an extension of normal appearance.(iii) rarely an infection of urinary system and kidneys (recent or old) can cause such a finding, but this is likely only if you have symptoms like pain in the region of kidney and problems like burning urination or discoloration of urine or any kidney infections in the past.(iv) stones in kidney or ureter can also cause fullness of pelvicalyceal system and since you do not have any stone therefore this does not apply to you. it is important to know if your scan was repeated after passing urine and still there was persistent mild fullness of the pelvicalyceal system on left side. this can also be confirmed by doing an mvp which is injecting a contrast and taking 5 to 6 x-rays to study the functioning of the kidneys in a better way. please consult the urologist."

(as you said he has difficulty in walking now). you can also say to his parents that --- they can continue with all religious customs along with medicines, may be then they will agree... with medicine, he will start showing improvement in few days only... it is psychosis and patients will not agree to go to any doctor willingly, so you might need to take him forcefully. this is well accepted as it is for his benefit only. even if he doesn't agree for oral medicine there are injectables which are given to such patients... take the right step, take him to a doctor. hope the reply is useful feel free to ask more questions"

"of , i have been off birth control demo shot since march , only took the shot for 2 maybe 3 months and i cant seem to get pregnant ? hi , i took the demo birth control shot 2 months maybe 3 , but the last time i took it was march and i wan a get pregnant and i cant ?",1,47706,"hi, dont get worried reading unfounded stories. demo shot does not damage your fertility. although the demo shot needs to be repeated 12-16 weeks, when it is stopped usually it does not lose its effect in that time period. the effect can last longer because the microcrystals of depot injection sometimes dissolve very slowly. therefore, there is some delay in ovulation and conception. although pregnancy can occur as early as three and half months after the last shot, the average time for ovulation to start is about five and half months. but the time for becoming pregnant takes a little longer, the average being about 10 months from the last shot. for some women it may take up to 18 months. i hope i have answered your concerns. if you have any further queries, do contact me through chat doctor"

i a am 29 years old and a mon of two and a half old son . a am planning to conceive again but my periods have been always irregular . when a wanted to conceive first time a was in india and by doctor asked me to take folic acid tablets 5mg dosage once a day and glucophage metformin tab thrice a day and also removal 2.5 my letrozole tablets starting from day 3 of my periods til 7th day . and a have conceived in 5 months . should a start taking it again to conceive .,1,12366,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, i want to reassure you that it commonly can take up to a year from healthy couples to conceive. you are not diagnosed as infertile unless you and your husband have been trying to conceive (which means having unprotected intercourse at least two or three days a week) for at least a year. folic acid is a b vitamin that does not help you to get pregnant, however it is recommended to take during early pregnancy because it helps prevent birth defects. siphene, also known as camphene citrate, is a fertility medication. it can help induce ovulation in women who are infertile because they do not ovulate. however, if your periods normally come every month, there is no reason to suspect that you are not ovulating. because you are under the age of 35, i recommend that you and your husband to not take any more fertility medications and try to conceive for another six months on your own. normally, your most fertile time is between the time your period stops until you start to feel premenstrual symptoms. for most couples, that means having sex every other day from about the seventh day of your cycle until the 23rd to 25th day. if you and your husband have not conceived in another six months, i recommend both of you see fertility specialist, as 50% of the time lack of pregnancy can be a problem with the men sperm as well. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful, and you and your husband are able to have a baby soon. best wishes,"

"is it wise for a daughter to tell her mother that she has borderline personality , and point to behavior the child remembers from growing up ( i.e . telling the mother that she thinks her mother has lived her life in emotional turmoil , when the mother does not feel that way at all )",1,27023,"hi, thanks for writing to us, as you have explained, your daughter has had a difficult childhood being brought up by a single mother. she also might have witnessed her fathers' attitude towards the family or towards you who is her mother and as you say he was promiscuous. she has not had a father figure in her life and may have had improper parental supervision for many of these stated reasons. all this can have a negative impact on the development of a children personality. a person can have deviant personality traits which make them more vulnerable to problems like addiction or excessive usage of things like the internet and mobile phones to an extent of neglect of routine activities, seeking fulfillment of emotional needs from strangers, especially of the opposite gender or confabulating or manipulating by making up stories in order to get what they want. firstly it would be advisable to get a detailed psychiatric evaluation at this point to rule out the possibility of any underlying mental illness. to make sure she does not truly believe the stories she has been telling people. you also need to make sure she is not having any genuine adjustment problems in the hostel. if this happens to be her way of manipulating you into getting her out of hostel then it would be advisable to keep her in the hostel till she gets used to it eventually. get in touch with her hostel authorities and try to be aware of her behavior and also see if they can help you out by keeping her constantly engaged in some activities by making a schedule for her daily activities till late in the evening, by including sports, studies, projects, monitoring etc. this would help her a great deal. hope this helps, chat doctor."

(would you be having it then?) now your cycle is of 30 days period. so the expected date of ovulation should be 07 january. hence, if the conception takes place on 07 january, the due date of delivery would be 30 september. the hitch here is that you should have ovulation taking lace on 07 january. moreover, we have noticed that all the pregnancies do not last for 280 days. the delivery can take place any time between 3 weeks earlier to 1 week later than the expected due date of delivery. keeping these facts and calculations in mind, you may plan your sexual relations accordingly. i hope this will help you."

"i , may a answer your health queries right now ? please type your query here ... a have had a partial and since then a have had many urinary tract infections and yeast infections and white discharge that is thick but no door or pain or itching . that could it be menopause ?",3,945,"hello, klebsiella is mostly and primarily found in not immunocompetent individuals, usually in hospital settings and cause the so-called hospital-acquired infections (hai). they could cause opportunistic urinary tract infections, pneumonia and other respiratory infections, bacteremia, infection of surgical wounds, etcetera. in diabetics, people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, etcetera. due to their particular structure, klebsiella species are naturally resistant to penicillin-type antibiotics, some aminoglycosides (gentamicin, kanamycin, streptomycin, etcetera.). often their treatment is possible only through the use of carbapenems and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, etcetera.). klebsiella is considered part of the normal flora in various parts of intestine and colon. recent studies have reported that recurrent klebsiella urinary tract infections are caused by persistent klebsiella found in the urinary tract even after appropriate antibiotic treatment and all persons with recurrent infections were elderly and diabetics. recurrent strains of klebsiella also had increased adhesion and invasiveness compared to colonization strains (those causing infection for the first time) and this might explain their tendency to cause repeated infections. now, it is known that frequent sexual intercourse is the strongest risk factor for recurrent urinary tract infections in healthy women, and it is why your disease comes back each time you have sex with your partner. the fact that the disease comes back after you have sex with your partner puts in high risk of future urinary tract infections. in your case the following measures could be of benefit: 1. continuous antibiotic prophylaxis for six months, by using low doses of the antibiotic that is more effective in your case. you have to consult with your doctor about which antibiotic you will use and for how long.2. post-coital therapy, by applying a single dose of the most effective antibiotic each time after having sex. you again have to consult with your doctor about the dose and type of antibiotic. 3. apply the so-called post-coital voiding that is: urinating immediately after sex.4. you should maintain high genital hygiene as it could help as well. it is also important that you have a thorough evaluation by radiological examinations in order to rule out abnormalities of the urinary tract (anatomical or functional) that could boost infection recurrence. lastly, klebsiella is not transmitted sexually, thus clearly your partner has nothing to do with your recurrent infections. but, during each intercourse, it is easier for the bacteria to get contact with your urinary tract (remember that klebsiella is a normal part of intestinal tract and colon). hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

for about a week now a have an increasing stabbing pain between my shoulder blades with stiff neck and left sided migraine . a am experiencing some tightness around my ribcage . a have some shortness of breath and dizziness . a do not have a fever or high blood pressure .,2,1409,"pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium with occasional pericardial effusion. about 90% of the causes are unknown. most people will have viral type symptoms such as fever, myalgic, and malaise. pericarditis can also cause cute, sharp, stabbing chest pain that can last hours to days. some people will also get shortness of breath and pain with breathing. i am assuming you had a pretty extensive work up before being diagnosed with pericarditis. the work up should've included blood work with inflammatory markers and cardiac markers, as well as ekg changes. the first line treatment is usually ibuprofen several times daily for about two weeks. there are other anti-inflammatories that work just as good if you cannot tolerate ibuprofen. steroids are actually a second line treatment but work just as good as ibuprofen. generally, about 7 to 10 days of ibuprofen can significantly decrease your symptoms and pericarditis. you should also get plenty of rest. some people have will have recurrent pericarditis. you should also have an ultrasound of your heart to make sure there is no fluid around the heart. if you do not get better with ibuprofen in 10 days, i would recommend having a further work up to make sure you do not have my own pericarditis which involves the heart muscle."

"hi i had a baby 3 yrs ago after being diagnosed with pcs , i done have the syndrome just the over problem . i got pregnant naturally and very out of the blue ! i was just wondering what my chances of conceiving again would be ? i did an ovulation test last month and done think i ovulated ? than a",1,87829,"hif you have had sex on the ovulation day, then pregnancy test can be done on the 7th day after sex. the logic is implantation of baby into uterus occurs on the 6th-7th day after ovulation. with implantation, pregnancy hormone is secreted, and it can be detected by tests. this is the earliest time to do pregnancy test. urine test may not detect it. you need to do blood pregnancy test. so only when you have sex at the time /just after ovulation pregnancy test can be done after 6-7 days. what you have heard is right. the first week and the last week of a menstrual cycle are safe. a woman cannot get pregnant if she has unprotected sex during this period. i hope i have answered your concerns."

a am a teenager and lately a have been experiencing pains in the center of my chest . it first it was discomforting and shortened my breath a little but the last time it increased and made my chest very tight and made me unable to hardly breathe . a laid down and the pain settled although a was unable to get up because the pain was so bad . lately a have taken up some exercising . would that have a reason to why this is happening ?,1,103171,"hello friend, thank you for posting your query through chat doctor. i also think that you were affected by a virus for the last one week. but that virus is not what you are talking about. virus is a biological waste particle in your body as a result of the disease and not the cause of diseases. i am a homeopath and so you be prepared to hear something different about your diseases. the virus i meant was something in the dynamic level, a mental conflict. since in your opinion these mental influences have no significance, you did not mention anything about that in your query. these mental conflicts made you sick to the level of reducing your immunity. this made you susceptible to diseases. the first disease was a conjunctivitis, a relatively harmless affection. but when you started suppressing it with local application, it went to a deeper level producing deeper affections. your conjunctivitis was in the epidermal level but the period problem and the unusual tiredness was in the euro endocrine level. that is why you had a very bad period this time. all your hormonal system got shattered, and you suffered unusually bad this time. now my suggestion is that you should stop external application or medication to control conjunctivitis. it can be managed simply by frequent washing of eyes with pure cold water. you are advised to have constitutional treatment to strengthen and cleanse your constitution. i can confidently suggest you to take homeopathy for that. you have proved that your health is not very good because you have the history of cancer and getting periods only once in a year after chemotherapy. my concern is more about your constitution which reacts badly to any stimulation and my advice is to get homeopathic treatment from an expert. i can also help you provided you ask a premium question, or you contact me directly with more details about you because homeopathy never treats your diseases but treats only you. with best wishes, chat doctor. j. varese, homoeopath,"

a am 8 weeks pregnant . this is my 3rd pregnancy in a year miscarried the first two at 6 weeks . last week a went in for some minor spotting and the heartbeat was 157 bpm and or said baby looked great . a am still bleeding a little nothing major and scared . is it common to miscarry after seeing and hearing a strong he ?,1,95293,"thank you for the question. while the morning after pill is very effective, it is not 100% effective. if you got pregnant, then a pregnancy test will turn positive about two weeks after conception. also, the symptoms you are describing are possibly related to pregnancy as you can have cramping and spotting. yes, this might be implantation bleeding. if you check a pregnancy test, and it is positive then get checked out immediately to make sure that this is a normal pregnancy or possibly a pregnancy in one of your tubes (called an ectopic pregnancy). that being said, it is much more likely that you are not pregnant and bleeding or spotting in the week after taking the morning after pill is also very common. finally, this pill will also likely delay the next period. i hope that this helps and good luck!"

"a have had the contraceptive implant for nearly 2 years , in the last 2 months live had my first period since the implant was inserted and been having irregular periods since . my breasts are sore also , is it time to change my implant and also if i was to have the implant removed what alternatives that are similar to the implant could i have that would stop or regulate my periods ?",1,79682,"hello there. implant is a hormonal device. side effects of implant use include lighter, irregular and infrequent bleeding. sometimes there are no periods at all which is not accountable to pregnancy if the device was used in the right way. so your pink discharge can be due to the side effect of implant. nausea, headache, sore breasts and weight gain are also seen with implant use. smoking does not affect the contraceptive efficacy of implant, but it does predispose you to serious side effects associated with implant like stroke and blood clots. so it is better if you stop smoking with implant in situ. you can test for pregnancy just to be sure. secondly i want you to visit your gynecologist for an internal examination to rule out other causes of unexpected vaginal bleeding (pink discharge). a pap smear is also mandatory if you have not done in the past one year. take care."

"a actually really scared ... = [ its over a year since i discovered this lump near my vagina , well it in the crease between my vagina and my thigh . it started as a small skin coloured lump and it just got bigger . within the last month or so this lump has become red and today it has changed completely . it is now an actual whole in my skin , its bright red inside and is oozing a liquid a bit like puss . pm sorry for being so graphic in just really scared and would like some answers .",1,95340,"hi, i understand your concern and your problem. this may happen in the following scenarios. 1. the nova ring is broken; sometimes the joint of the ring is broken, so it may not regain back its desired shape once inside the vagina and slips out. in this case try a new ring.2. the vagina is lax and roomy. sometimes vaginal laxity may interfere with holding the ring in place, this is very rare and unless the vagina is too lax, it does not slip.3. ring not pushed far enough; sometimes women do not push it far enough inside so that it remains at the vaginal opening and slips out. the first and third are common likely causes. check to see if any of this is happening to you. if the ring is broken use a new one and use some other method like condom for next 7 days. if you are scared to push it in, i want to reassure you that don't be afraid. this ring is safe and will not go anywhere other than the vagina. it does not cause any trauma, so it is safe. just push it way inside, so it will not slip. the best position to do this is lying down and slowly pushing it inside towards your buttocks that is backwards. a tilted uterus will not affect the position of the ring and neither will it have any effect on its insertion. another word of caution is that if the ring has been lying outside for more than 3 hours, use another method like condom for the next seven days after correctly inserting the ring. hope i was able to help you, thank you for using chat doctor and have a nice day."

"i or , a am a 32 or old women , and quite recently in started feeling a pricking pain on right side of my abdomen , just besides navel . the pain is more is more severe when a bend my self to pick something or get up from bed even . a feel something sharp is hurting me from inside . a need help for this . that it could be and what shall a do ?",1,50838,hi.thanks for your query. you have got a pulsating cramp in lower right abdomen below bellybutton slightly to the right of it. it happens just after ejaculation and last for about 10 minutes. the pain is fairly severe when it is happening and if you bend forward it gets much worse. and it is slightly alleviated when you stand up straight or bend back slightly. the possible causes are:prostatitisepididymitis or obstruction in the pathways of semen. this can be diagnosed by ;ultrasonography and color doppler examination of the abdomen and scrotum. clinical evaluation to see the probable reason and correct surgically.

"a am a 21 year old female and my partner is 36 years old . be are trying for a baby but nothing has happened yet . would this be down to a low sperm count ? a have been pregnant before and had a termination . be has 2 children . to i know we can both conceive , but i think he may have a low sperm count , what is the best thing to do ?",1,43820,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, i want to reassure you that no matter what your endometrial measurement may be, 80% of couples will conceive within one year naturally. couples are not diagnosed as infertile until you have been trying and been unable to become pregnant for over one year. endometrial thickness is really only relevant in the context of couples trying to get pregnant through in vitro fertilization. the thickness of your uterine lining is somewhat related to your estrogen levels. when couples are undergoing ivf, treating with additional estrogen can thicken the uterine lining. however, because you've been only trying to get pregnant for four months, your endometrial lining may have absolutely nothing to do with the reason why you have not yet conceived. furthermore, unless your husbands' sperm count has been shown to be decreased, magazine should not have any effect on fertility nor should affect any health of a developing baby should you conceive. medications taken during pregnancy by the mother can affect the fetus, but not any medication taken by the father, because medication cannot be transmitted before fertilization through sperm. so unless the medication causes the sperm count to be low or abnormal, there is no medical reason why your husband needs to be off his medication for colitis in order for you and need to conceive successfully. i suggest that if he needs the medication for his health that he continue to take it. as for is maximizing your chance of healthy pregnancy, the best thing you can do is get plenty of sleep, eat a well-balanced diet, take prenatal vitamins, and tried to have regular(at least 2 to 3 days a week) unprotected intercourse from the time your menstrual period finishes until you begin to feel premenstrual symptoms. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and i wish you and your husband the best of luck in conceiving. best wishes,"

"hi ... a 23 year old , a a having a lump in a left breast .... doctors said its fibroadenosis .... hong medicine since then but no relief .... fear dat it may not turn into adenoma .... can i get rid of it forever ? ? ? with or without surgery ? ? ? a if i go for surgery i fear dat i int get by permanent deformity in a breast",1,82366,"hello friend, thank you for posting your query through chat doctor. i am a homeopath answering your query and the answer which i am going to give you may contain several thoughts which may appear strange or new for you. this i say because homeopathy is a new system of medicine and is almost unheard by the majority of the population. therefore, due to the high influence of the conventional medicine the people at large are brainwashed to believe and act according to the health education given by them. coming back to the fibroadenoma of your left breast in the year 1979, you had a psychological conflict in the mind level. you are a sensitive individual and that is why your left breast was affected. it must have been related with your child chat doctor. the sensitivity is genetic, and you reacted to the conflict through the brain according to a genetic programming. mind-brain - organ affection resulted in the development of a lump in your left breast in 1979. you consulted your gynecologist, and he suggested that it may turn to become cancerous in future and so it is better to remove it, and you subdued to his suggestion. actually the lump in the breast was an attempt of the body to cure you, or it was the result of a self defense mechanism. since you had not resolved the conflict in the psychological level, the lump remained there without getting resolved. but the body kept the lump protected in a cyst with minimum amount of inflammation called chronic cystitis. by removing the fibroadenoma or chronic cystic mastitis, you were not cured, but your lump in the breast was removed. in 1995 also you are the same person, you are the same sensitive person, and you underwent another more serious psychological conflict and the same left breast was again affected in a more serious manner. instead of recognizing the mass as a defense mechanism, you got the fear in you that you have cancer. the tissue changes also suggested that there is more serious pathology, and they labelled your lump this time as cancer and suggested removal of your left breast. if you could have recognized the lump as a defense mechanism and if you had no fear of cancer, you could have retained your breast. but the fear of cancer is such that it is associated with death and so you lost your breast. in no case, either by removal of lump in 1979 or by removal of your breast in 1995, you are not cured only your disease is cured. hope by this time you have got the answer for your query. both are related to each other because they are in the same individual, same sensitivity, same program. homeopathy cures the person and once the individual is cured all his diseases will be cured. with best wishes,"

"a received the tetras the next day i felt like my heart or something was really sore .. i had also stated running lot recently ... today the opposite arm of where i got the shot is in so much my shoulder , and i cant really mover it too much cause it hurts so bad",1,11625,"ok, the top question i do not see the milligram of gabapentin. 800 mg three times a day is the usual top dose. however, a key point on medications is the dose dependence of bad things happening. the relationship between chat doctor. gabapentin is extremely low risk, high safety, but, its side effect curve (sleepiness) is weird in that it starts at about 1 in three people at the low dose having sleepiness and it doesn't really change much with higher dosing. bad stuff doesn't seem to happen with much higher doses as opposed to most things (like water) where going up 3 to 5-fold is dangerous. flexeril is dangerous above the recommended dose which is the maximum safe dose. it affects muscle including heart. bad. narcotics are the more usual case. low low doses don't do much. average doses have some risks and some help. going above the recommended dose increases both some pain relief but vastly increases the danger of stopping breathing, addiction, etc. cant say about the back injections because i do not know what is injected. steroids would typically stick in any space they are put into for weeks not days, but this depends on if it is steroids injected and what type of steroid. lidocaine wouldn't last as long but its quite safe except for the needle which can hit something each time. steroids in theory weaken muscle, tendon, bone, but i've never seen anyone who's gotten 10 injections in their entire lives so, i cannot comment on actual problems. the near 100% risk of local minor bruising and local pain and significant risk of spinal fluid leak with spinal injections are the biggest risk (of minor seriousness). back muscle injections....the injections themselves are really close to zero risk; we do antibiotic shots daily. thousands. not much risk. oh, wait flu shots. tens of thousands. not much risk."
"a received the tetras the next day i felt like my heart or something was really sore .. i had also stated running lot recently ... today the opposite arm of where i got the shot is in so much my shoulder , and i cant really mover it too much cause it hurts so bad",2,90027,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. overactive thyroid is actually normal in some women during the first trimester of pregnancy, because the pregnancy hormone stimulates the thyroid and its levels are highest in the first trimester. it is not dangerous unless your levels are very high, and you have symptoms (like a racing pulse or heart palpitations). severe overactive thyroid can lead to a condition called thyroid storm, which can cause heart failure and other complications; but again, this danger is only to the mother. your ob provider should refer you to see a specialist if your levels are so high that you may need medication. when the baby is born, it is important for the babies pediatrician to know about your thyroid history, as sometimes the babies hormone level can be too low after birth because it has received so much thyroid hormone from you while it was inside. i want to reassure you that treating your thyroid hormone level really depends on how high it is, and many patients do not even need medication. discussion with your prenatal care provider should help in determining if you need medication. you may need to see an endocrinologist who can prescribe medication to lower your levels of thyroid hormone if they are at a dangerous level. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was reassuring to you. best wishes, and good luck with the rest of the pregnancy,"

"i , my baby is 8 months old , and she had septic enteritis at 1 month age , and had blood stool . the get recovery from that time , and now it comes again after 2 days diarrhoea . be did the rotavirus test , it shows negative . the looks fine everyday , so i done know how i could do for her .. what do you suggest ?",1,59118,"thanks for asking on chat doctor. let me ad chat doctor. breast milk is the best food for a baby and there can be no alternatives to that. formula milk like lactose are cow milk based and hence hard to digest for a baby. it may lead to greenish stools. but reddish is not normal, and you should get the stool tested for routine microscopy and occult blood. passing stool 10 times a day is equally normal as passing stool once in 10 days, and you need not bother about it unless the stool is very hard. lactogen 3 is unsuitable for a baby of this age and can be given only after 1 year of age. so stop giving it. i would like to ask what do you mean by normal food. a baby is supposed to receive only breast milk and nothing else till the age of 6 months. in case breast milk is inadequate, supplementation with formula milk can be given, but that should be age appropriate. although it is not a dangerous situation, it needs to be managed properly, and you need to get guidance on this from a pediatrician. visit a doctor with the stool report or post a query directly to me with the report and i would try to help you further."

"is it normal for a girl to miss her period when on birth control ? my girlfriend jus started take birth control for the first time and they finished on saturday and the is the week she should get her period , but today makes 4 days now and she still haven got her period . since she been on them we had sex only once and we used a condom .",1,46870,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. bleeding after sex can occur in women of all ages, but it is not unusual at all when a girl is in her teen years because her own menstrual cycle is still maturing and also chafing inside from sex can occur. furthermore, any bleeding from the uterus can produce cramps, even if it's at the incorrect time. condoms are extremely effective in preventing pregnancy if they were applied before any genital contact and remain on during intercourse and when you pull out. furthermore, the most common sign of pregnancy is a missed menstrual period, so if your girlfriend has not actually missed a cycle she really does not need to worry about pregnancy. if your girlfriend herself is also on birth control pills, irregular bleeding and spotting can be a side effect of the pill as well. so in summary, there are lots of reasons why your girlfriend could be bleeding irregularly, but if you are using proper contraception and condoms, pregnancy is not really one of the things you need to be concerned about. if your girlfriend starts to bleed regularly after sex she really should be evaluated by a doctor, as inflammation or infections of the cervix can cause postcoital (after sex) bleeding as well. i hope that i was adequately able to answer your question today, and that my advice was reassuring. best wishes,"

"i i have a history of polycyclic ovary with irregular periods , i got married last year , tried for a year to conceive but failed , this feb i have done a laparoscopy and ovarian drilling and galloping tube clearing too .... can you you tell me by when generally conceiving will happen after this operation ?",1,52747,"hello, and i hope i can clarify this for you. you are absolutely correct in the fact that the length of your cycle is related to when you ovulate... and your ovulation date is 14 days back from when you got your period, rather than counting 14 days from the start of your period. it is typical for most women to have a 14-day luteal phase, as you suggested. you absolutely may ovulate later in your cycle. i do not know how long you and your partner have tried to conceive before trying closed. i would not recommend trying closed at all unless you have tried for a year (meaning unprotected sex at least 2-3 times per week) and not become pregnant. a reproductive endocrinologist is an appropriate referral if you have a history of infertility for one year, and if you fail at least 3 cycles of closed. they can prescribe closed and combine it with intrauterine insemination, which can increase the success rate. even though you may have had a child together before, there can be an issue with the male partner too, and it would be advisable he gets his sperm count evaluated. but you can still have conceived this cycle if you ovulated on the closed, and continued to have unprotected sex at least a week after your ovulation kit showed positive. your progesterone level pre-ovulation is not relevant at all. so- if you don't get a period by day 35 or so, do a pregnancy test. and if you didn't conceive this cycle, a reproductive endocrinologist might be a better choice to manage your closed. i hope this answered your question, and best of luck in getting pregnant. take care,"

a had the flu recently which lasted longer than normal for me ( 3 weeks ) but 2 weeks ago a noticed my lower ribs hurting . a assumed a strained them coughing but we are now 2 weeks later and the pain is getting worse . is there anything a can do or do a need to see my up ?,1,85262,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. there are two possibilities of what may be going on if you do not yet see a heartbeat with your pregnancy. the first, even though you are sure of your lmp, conception can take place at a different time in your cycle than you expected. the egg can live inside you up to 72 hours after ovulation, and sperm can remain alive inside you for up to 5 days. so you actually may have conceived a week later than you thought, which means that you are only 6 weeks pregnant. it can be normal to not see a heartbeat at 6 weeks. the other possibility is that the fetus died already at 6 weeks, which is a miscarriage that has not come out yet. the way we can figure out what is going on is to check another ultrasound in a week or so. if there is no heartbeat by 7 weeks, then the diagnosis of a miscarriage is correct. so i know it is hard to be patient, but there is nothing that can be done to prevent miscarriage. one of every 10 pregnancies are miscarriages, meaning 90 percent of the time after a miscarriage women go on to have a healthy baby. i hope i was able to answer your question and that this information was helpful to you. best wishes, and good luck with the pregnancy,"

"hi , my question is regarding blood in urine . i never had a problem with it , but today i thought i saw it while showering . and i should mention i did get hit in the genitals with a soccer ball very hard prior to the shower . i still feel pain in the lower abdomen and occasional pain while walking in the area between the anus and the testicles . should i see my doctor or will it get better with time ?",1,91332,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the complication of getting blood clots in the legs, called a dvt, or groin is uncommon but not rare during pregnancy. normally, the clock will gradually disappear with the aid of blood thinners. it actually takes somewhere between one even more than three months for the clock to actually dissolve and be reabsorbed by the bloodstream. therefore, the symptoms of pain, and swelling in the leg where the blockage occurred are not unusual while this is taking place. the most dangerous complication of a blood clot in the legs for pregnant woman is if a piece of the clot actually breaks off it can travel through the bloodstream towards the lungs and cause serious complications for breathing and sometimes even death. so symptoms your daughter-in-law should watch out for our shortness of breath, chest pain, or feeling very anxious with a rapid heartbeat. in terms of pain control for right now, applying a hot water bottle (comfortably hot) to the groin or soaking in a warm bath can help to relieve the pain symptoms at this time. your daughter-in-law should discuss the further management of her blood clot with her doctor but in the meantime it is much too early to see improvement in the pain. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was helpful. best wishes to your daughter-in-law for the rest of her pregnancy,"

(the amount of platelets in the bloodstream is reduced because the spleen is busy trapping them). so usually people with cirrhosis end up having a problem with portal hypertension and an enlarged spleen, and a reduced platelet count in the bloodstream. as time goes by, the liver may try to repair itself by growing new cells. if there is a lot of scar tissue already present the new cells grow between scar tissue (and result in abnormal nodules). the nodules and scar tissue further interfere with blood flow through the liver. so over time people with advanced cirrhosis can end up having a problem with more and more abnormal nodules and scar tissue forming which interferes even more with blood flow through the liver which makes the spleen continue to enlarge, and the platelet count continue to chat doctor. the splenomegaly is usually not reversible. please go for regular medical follow up. hope this helps"

hello . ave had chronic fatigue/lyme disease for 8 years . not sick at 13 and pm 21 now . a was on anti biotic for 8 months with moderate relief . however when a got on the pale diet and started supplementing high doses of zinc and b6 as recommended by a naturopath a felt 90 % better within weeks . pm not sure why though . is there any connection between the two supplements and disease ?,1,59679,"hello dear. lyme disease is related to painful rashes on armpit and thigh, but may not be related to brain scarring. lyme disease is usually curable with antibiotics. this is so true that some authors of lyme disease research have stated that the most common cause of lack of response of lyme disease to antibiotics is a lack of lyme disease to begin with! the type of antibiotic depends on the stage of the disease (early or late) and what areas of the body are affected. early illness is usually effectively treated with medications taken by mouth, for example, doxycycline (tobramycin), amoxicillin (mobil), or cefuroxime acetic (certain). these generally result in a rapid cure of lyme disease. therefore, if a person finds a typical bulls-eye skin rash (described above) developing in an area of a tick bite, they should seek medical attention as soon as possible. generally, antibiotic treatment resolves the rash within one or two weeks with no long-term consequences. later illness such as nervous-system disease might require intravenous chat doctor. there are no home remedies to treat lyme disease. in those people with two or more episodes of erythema migrant rash, even years apart, it is felt that the episodes represent different infections or reinfection rather than persistence of the original infection. for relief of lyme disease symptoms, pain-relieving medicines might be added. swollen joints can be reduced by the doctor removing fluid from them (arthrocentesis). an arthrocentesis is a procedure whereby fluid is removed from a joint using a needle and syringe under sterile conditions. it is usually performed in a doctor's office. rarely, even with appropriate antibiotics, the arthritis continues. it has been suggested by researchers that sometimes joint inflammation can persist even after eradication of the lyme bacteria. this complication has been explained as an ongoing autoimmune response causing inflammation of the joint that was initially stimulated by the original bacterial infection. oral medications such as ibuprofen (motrin, turin) can also be used to reduce inflammation and improve function. there is no evidence that nonspecific fatigue that persists after treatment for lyme disease is related to persistent infection. the risks of prolonged treatments with antibiotics are far greater than any benefit in this situation. of note, recent research was done to study whether longer-term antibiotic treatment of persistent symptoms of lyme disease led to any better outcomes than shorter-term treatment. the study found that longer-term antibiotic treatment did not have additional beneficial effects on health-related quality of life beyond those with shorter-term treatment. specifically, the researchers determined that this longer-term antibiotic treatment had no more beneficial effect on fatigue, or musculoskeletal, neuropsychological, or cognitive symptoms and disorders from lyme disease than placebo hope i have answered your question. feel free to contact me if you have any more questions. i'll be glad to help you. all the besting warm regards"

hi doctor .. me and my husband are trying to conceive for 3 months now .. 1st month my period was 2 days late and the send month it was one day before and then on last month a had my periods 5 days late and lasted only for 3 days .. i did hpt and it was negative .. i sometimes feel pain in my breasts . is there any problem with me getting pregnant ?,1,49266,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. if you last had your period on september 12th, and today is october 5th, your period is not yet late for october. most women have a 25-35 day cycle, so until you actually miss your period for october, there is no reason to assume you are pregnant. the folic acid and zinc you are taking are just extra vitamins that provide health to a growing pregnancy; these should not affect or change your menstrual cycle or its symptoms. if your period is late in october, you should purchase and perform an over-the-counter pregnancy test. modern pregnancy tests are very accurate and can be positive even 10 days after conception. if you do find out you are pregnant, there is nothing that needs to be done immediately as pregnancy is not a disease- it is a normal state for women in the reproductive phase of their lives. so it is important only to keep taking your vitamins, get plenty of rest, eat a balanced diet and avoid alcohol, caffeine and chat doctor. if your period is mate, but you are not pregnant, the delay in your cycle can have a number of causes, including hormonal imbalances, certain medical conditions like thyroid disease, and even the stress of worrying about pregnancy. if you miss more than 2 months of your cycle (no bleeding for 3 months) and your pregnancy test is negative, you should see a physician for a hormonal evaluation. so in summary, a late menstrual cycle can be caused by pregnancy, but there are other causes as well. i suggest you perform a pregnancy test if you are late, and if it is negative, try to be patient, and you will likely get it before another month goes by. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"hello doctor,5 years back i had a severe headache followed by visual disturbance in my left eye lasted for few minutes.i am diagnosed with a calcified lesion at right occipital lobe . taken albendazole for a month and extol for 2 years . recently i had a visual disturbance again without headache . during last 4 months i have a feeling of right knee tingling intermittently . why is this tingling happening . should i have to continue extol .. then for how much time . is there any procedure to remove lesion . will today i done have any record of seizure .",1,13874,"hi, thank you for posting your query. a calcified lesion is most often due to a healed tape worm infection, called as neurocysticercosis. since the worm is already dead, as suggested by calcification, albendazole is not necessary. the visual symptoms could be a sign of seizure, and it may be due to the location of lesion in the occipital lobe. so, extol may have to be restarted and continued for long. tingling in knee is an unrelated problem. best wishes, chat doctor."

yes a am a 32yr old male . a am having difficulty urinating and have been having difficulty for some time now . when a do go and think a am done a continue to have a small amount come out . a am also unable to get an erection . for the past couple of weeks a have been experiencing pain in my lower back and hips that seems worse at night . by father had prostate problems and a am concerned ..... however a know it would be very rare at my age ...... is it possible ? a see my doctor next week monday,1,90927,"hi, i am chat doctor. i have read your message. i think i can help you. first, the symptoms that you have described are highly suggestive of seizures. here is why- 1. they come in night-seizures are commonly triggered when the patient sleeps or just around the sleep. of course, they can occur at other times too.2. they start from the leg and move up and then spread to the rest of the body.3. the episodes last 3-4 minutes and then resolves. i assume (you have not mentioned it) that it is never remembered by him, the episode that is. i think you should both take it very seriously. there is a high possibility that there is an intracranial problem that he is having which is extending and progressing undetected in the brain just because you do not want to visit a neurologist. i think you should meet a neurologist as soon as possible and request an mri brain (with spectroscopy if needed) and video eeg. if he does turn out to have a pathology, treatment will have to be initiated for the pathology in addition to regular anti-epileptic medicines. i suggest taking a video of these episodes that he is having. it may help convince him that he needs to visit a doctor, and it may be helpful to the doctor in seeing the condition that your husband has. yes, you need to visit a neurologist as soon as possible. ideally, i would also like to know if he has been having headaches for the past years? does he seem to be having episodes where he does not recollect what he has been doing for a certain duration of time? you may need to talk to his colleagues at work and find out if he has been having seizures or any abnormal behavior at work. there is a high chance that he knows that he has been having seizures at work and not telling you about it. i have tried my best to help you. unfortunately, i cannot initiate / suggest medicines as long as the diagnosis is not confirmed because the anti-epileptics may have severe side effects. best of luck,"

"by big toe feels just like ave gotten stuck with a large needle . it keeps happening out of the blue over and over . a read online some folks talking about fibromyalgia , but a have never been diagnosed with it or had any of the other symptoms . very healthy otherwise ! this just keeps happening .",1,13930,"hello, and thank you for your question. fortunately, you probably do not have fibromyalgia. there are several possible causes of pain just in the toe. if there is a pinched nerve in the lower spine, it can cause pain that can be just in one toe. if this is the case, you may find that the pain is worse with change in position, such as lying flat or standing up. pain in the toe, typically the big toe, is common in a disorder called gout, in which the body has too much uric acid. the pain usually lasts a few days at a time, and is usually associated with redness and swelling. pain in the toes can be caused by corns or other skin problems that look small but feel very severe. pins and needles, shooting, on-and-off pains can be caused by irritation to a nerve by diabetes, by lack of vitamins such as b12, or by pressure - similar to the ""foot falling asleep"" feeling we sometimes get if we cross our legs too long. fibromyalgia, on the other hand, is usually a ""pain all over"" problem - back pain, neck pain, arm pain, knee pain, without another cause such as arthritis. it usually does not cause just one part of the body to hurt - most patients say that ""everything hurts"". in my practice, i start with finding out as much as i can from the patient about how the pain feels and how long it has been going on, and if it seems related to anything else. then we examine the foot to look for anything going on with the skin, check if the nerves of the foot are normally sensitive, not as sensitive as usual, or more sensitive, and then we may check blood tests to detect diabetes or vitamin deficiency or other problems as needed. fibromyalgia is diagnosed by obtaining a careful history of where the patient is having pain, other medical problems, and completing a physical exam including what is called a ""painful point"" exam where the doctor pushes at certain places in the body - on the back and near the joints - to see if this causes pain. i hope that my answer to your question is helpful. if you have any further questions, please check back with us. i hope your toe is much better soon."

my 1 or old son had a fever 104 for 3 days with swollen red gums his fever is now gone and he acts normal but his gums are still very swollen and red and bleeding now a done know what i should do the dry said might need to take him to a dentist what could be wrong his gums a only swollen where his 4 teeth are on the top and bottom,1,85685,"hi. welcome to chat doctor . i have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. as per your complaint low grade fever with swollen and bleeding gums seems to be most probably due to causes like viral infection leading to gingivostomatitis while similar symptoms can also be experienced by kids who are teething. during teething also there is inflammation and swelling of the gums due to pressure and breaking of the gums for letting teeth erupt in the mouth by cutting through the gums and the child can experience slight temperature rise also. so my suggestion is to give him acetaminophen [paracetamol or tylenol] for fever and pain and do cool compresses over the gums. you can use a very soft toothbrush to clean his teeth and also be gentle and careful, not to touch the gums... give him a soft and semisolid diet. hope this information helps. thanks and regards. chat doctor."

"hello , a am scheduled for surgery to have a partial pariodectomy for a geomorphic adenoma . a am worried about facial nerve paralysis following this and would like to know would it be possible to use a ems device which exercises the facial muscles following this surgery to help the facial nerve get back to normal ?",1,13983,"hello, i can understand your concern. as you are going for partial parotidectomy, there is a chance that facial nerve can be saved by the surgeon if it is not involved by the tumor. in that case, you will not face any symptoms of facial nerve paralysis. however, if the nerve is involved in the tumor, then it will have to be removed by the surgeon. even if it will not be removed, there is a chance that the tumor may press on the nerve in future and may cause facial nerve paralysis. if the nerve is damaged, you can give it about 6 months to regenerate on its own. sometimes it takes about a year or longer to get the sensation back. in any case, facial massage will sure help to regenerate the nerve faster. you can use ems device after the initial healing of the surgical site (about 3 weeks) and consulting with your surgeon in the follow-up appointment with the surgeon. if the tumor reappears, as that is the case with partial parotidectomy, you may have to go for total parotidectomy in future to remove the entire parotid gland to eliminate the chances of recurrence. i hope this information solves your query. thank you for choosing chat doctor. i wish you recover soon! best,"
