hi in janice 28 yrs old after birth i have a problem with of and in having treatment with it .. in taking derain for 5 months ... last month i checked my of i noticed that in having a pulse rate more than 100 and today 121 .. what this could possibly mean ? what must i do ?,2,77098,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. many women who have been on birth control for many years can develop a tolerance of sorts for the pills' ability to control your menstrual cycle, especially after they have not menstruated for a long time due to pregnancy or another cause. this can also occur to the fact that you did relatively recently give birth, especially if you were breastfeeding. bleeding when you are not supposed to have your period on the pill is called breakthrough bleeding. it does not mean the pill is ineffective as a contraceptive, but having some irregular bleeding in between periods or a different bleeding pattern that you may have had before the pregnancy is not unusual. having heavy bleeding in the morning is likely due to the blood accumulating in your vagina during the night, and then it all comes out at once when you get out of bed due to gravity. your cycle may get back to normal after a few more months on the pill, and taking it as close to the same time every day will help to reduce the risk of breakthrough bleeding. if it continues for more than 3 months, you may benefit from changing your birth control brand to one with a slightly higher dose of estrogen, as the estrogen in the pill is the ingredient that controls your menstrual cycle. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"hello doc , i have a one year old baby . the has got high cup levels more than 90 mg/l . by paediatrician has given her some injections . two months back her tic was high more than 22,000 .. she used to get fever sometimes 103 and 104f before getting treated . when csc was done her haemoglobin was only 6 .. then she got blood transfusion after which her haemoglobin was 16 .. but now again her haemoglobin has got down to 10 after two months . that is causing this .. ? ? a a really worried abut her ? ? please help me .",1,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

hi live been on the implants jus going onto 6months now .. but ova the past week live been having these constant tummy aches .. feeling a bit sick and falling asleep at weird times during the day.i took a home pregnancy test on thursday but came up negative.i a not sure as to weather i am or not as live been having irregular periods.if i was would it pick it up and what are the chances of being pregnant .,1,99504,"hi, well the fact that she took a pill after having sex was a good idea, as it greatly reduces the chances of getting pregnant while having unprotected sex or on the breakage of a condom. now, you must understand this, even though your girlfriends period is generally regular there are times when it is irregular for everyone, which means she can have her period later or earlier than normal. the fact that the home pregnancy test has given a negative result 3 weeks in a row is a good thing and in all likelihood means that she isn't pregnant. but if you're still having doubts about the results you can go to a doctor and ask them to test your girlfriends blood, it is by far one of the most efficient and accurate tests around, but takes time, since you have to make an appointment and see a doctor. i hope this answered your question."

"3 months ago , a suddenly got pain in my lower left back region and it now affects the whole left flank area . its impossible for me to bend over to dry my legs after a shower or get up and down using my abdominal muscles . pm getting very down from the constant immobility and now the doctor says its depression that causing the pain . help ? ? ! ! what has happened to my abdominal muscles ?",1,40606,"my dear friend, i think in the playground your fall has caused your muscles in the low back region to overstretched.these muscles are attached to vertebral column and are responsible for holding the column straight. so unnecessary stretching or bending forwards can cause the intervertebral disc to slip outside the vertebra.in this case the nerves which lies in between the vertebra get affected and causes pain. and the nerves whicchatdoctors out of the hip area goes down along the back side of both legs. so when you bend you feel pain because the muscles here are already fatigued and nerves are getting pressure while lying in between these muscles. so now you should take a rest for a couple of days, stsrt a home regimen of physiotherapy consisting of back muscle strengthening exercise and try to avoid bending too much forward. hope in this way you will be cured.thank you."

a am currently taking flucloxocillin for a boil that i have i know about the side affects but did not see anything about my period being late or missing altogether . a am 6 days late and have done a pregnancy test and it came back negative . could this be because of the antibiotic,1,7470,"hallow dear, i would have appreciated knowing when did you have your last menses and whether you have missed your period. missing a period is the first cardinal symptom of pregnancy. the other symptoms like nausea & vomiting, frequent urination and breast changes like engorgement and tenderness, dark discoloration of nipples & areola with increase in the size of areola and secretions through the nipples appear later - may be about 8-15 days after missing a period. from your history, i could not get the information about whether you are having any of these symptoms. only weird feeling in the abdomen cannot be attributed to pregnancy. nausea and weird feeling in the abdomen without missing a period could be due to the stress of (?unwanted) pregnancy! well, if you have missed your period, 8-10 days after that, please do pregnancy test on your overnight first morning urine examined; earlier, these tests may give false negative results. alternatively you may get beta chat doctor test done which is reliable even few days before the missed period. if you do not have facility of undergoing either of this test, you can go for ultrasonography about 10-15 days after missing a period which will give you direct visual evidence of your pregnancy status. clinical examination from obstetrician about 10 days after missing period also can give you clue about your pregnancy status. somehow, you have to opt for one of the diagnostic measures mentioned above for diagnosing your pregnancy. of course, if you have not missed your period as yet, please wait for the period to appear. if you get the period, no dilemma about pregnancy. i hope this helps you."

a a having very sharp waves of pain in my upper abdomen that rolls upwards towards the chest . this happens overtime i eat something . symptoms started when a took psyllium dusk day before yesterday and that very night i be had severe stomach pain . towel movements started today . but the pain is still there . help,1,26411,"hi. thanks for your query and an elucidated history, although very atypical in nature. the probable cause of the pains you had at the 36 weeks of pregnancy in the upper abdomen is :the loaded colon goes up as there is no space for this to be in the normal position. the stomach rotates upwards a bit and causes the pain like you described. do not worry. take lots of fibers in the diet, you can use dulcolax suppository to evacuate the colon, and you will be dined. do not use cathartics as this is contraindicated in late pregnancy."

(would you be having it then?) now your cycle is of 30 days period. so the expected date of ovulation should be 07 january. hence, if the conception takes place on 07 january, the due date of delivery would be 30 september. the hitch here is that you should have ovulation taking lace on 07 january. moreover, we have noticed that all the pregnancies do not last for 280 days. the delivery can take place any time between 3 weeks earlier to 1 week later than the expected due date of delivery. keeping these facts and calculations in mind, you may plan your sexual relations accordingly. i hope this will help you."

"hello , a a wondering if a could be pregnant . a a on the birth control pill , and have never missed it or had unprotected sex . however a am having a lot of pregnancy symptoms , and my body feels different recently . a had my last period , but it was very different to normal , it would normally last 5-6 days and a would bleed heavily every day , but this time it only lasted 3 days with very little blood . by symptoms are increased urination , tiredness , nausea , breast tenderness , more prominent veins on breasts and light cramps in lower stomach and back . please help !",1,81036,"hallow dear, pregnancy symptoms never appear so early. the first cardinal symptom of pregnancy to appear is missed period. all other symptoms like nausea & vomiting, frequent urination and breast symptoms appear about a week after that. posting 1 is a post-coital emergency contraceptive pill. it contains progesterone hormone. this pill is to be consumed within 72 hours after the unprotected sexual intercourse. if you have taken it within that stipulated time, you need not worry about pregnancy as it has got more than 90% success rate. being a progesterone medicine, it can cause some discomfort like engorgement and/or tenderness in the breasts. even there is likelihood of having some with chat doctor. it increases acidity in the stomach and hence may cause some abdominal discomfort to pain also. i feel you should wait for your menses to appear in their scheduled time. if they are delayed, still it could be due to posting which can delay it by about a week or so. so you can safely wait for 3 weeks after posting 1 has been consumed. if you do not get menses after that, you may perform pregnancy test on the first morning urine sample to find the status of pregnancy. alternatively, you may opt for beta chat doctor test which is very sensitive and can detect the pregnancy even few days before missed period. if any of this test reports that you are pregnant, and it is unwanted pregnancy, you can terminate it by medicines. please get rid of the stress of pregnancy. stress also can delay menstruation. i hope this helps you."

"of mother of 77 years old and of diabetic and going of dialysis , lately she has been sleeping alot and feeling weak . she goes of dialysis 3 times a week sometime she will miss 1 day out of that week , and want of eat whatever she wants , she wont listen of anyone when of comes of food she wants of eat , whatever she want of eat",1,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"a have been on birth control for over a month . last month , a took the entire pack correctly at 5:30 pm . due to nausea , a switched the time a take my pill to right before a go to bed , or 11:30pm/midnight right at the start of my new pack , around 4 days ago . should a be worried about the decreased effectiveness of my pill ? should a run to get an emergency contraceptive if a have had a sexual encounter within the last couple of days ?",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

by wife a endometrium thickness is very low and her e2 level is also low approx less than 30 units . she has pcod now she is taking glycomat for insulin resistant and doctor has suggested nominal plus and cipher 100 after her period . that is effect of these tabs on e2 or endometrium thick ?,1,687,"hello and i hope i can help you today. insulin is used to treat diabetes during pregnancy at all stages and is safe and effective. the disease of diabetes and high blood sugar is the part that is dangerous for the baby, and good glucose control is the best way to ensure a healthy child. good blood glucose levels should be less that 95 for fasting levels and less than 120 after meals (2 hours). if this is the way your wife checks her sugar, and you test at least 4 times daily, she is under very good control and should not need further adjustment of her insulin if her levels stay at the current level. she should be checking her sugar fasting and then 2 hours after every meal. so in summary, insulin is safe and absolutely necessary for the health of the baby if your wife has diabetes. please discuss the dosing regimen with your treating physician on a regular basis and make sure your wife checks her readings at least when she wakes up in the morning and then 2 hours after every meal. she should also write down what she eats, so her doctor can also know if any changes need to be made in the diet. i hope this information was helpful and answered your question adequately. best wishes to you and your wife for the rest of the pregnancy. sincerely,"

"a was experiencing a prickly tingly sensation in my chest yesterday up underneath my left breast that had me clutching my chest . a want feeling anything else , such as shortness of breath of tightness in my chest , but this feeling a had was enough to stop me in my tracks . what could this possibly mean ?",1,15046,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. feeling short of breath is not unusual while you're pregnant because the hormones of pregnancy actually have a way of telling your brain to breathe faster. this is to ensure that your baby gets enough oxygen, because as your belly gets bigger your lungs are not able to expand as well. so many women feel the sensation of needing to catch their breath all the time when they breathe when they are in the third trimester. in addition, because you would have been on bed rest for so long, you probably are not in very good cardiovascular shape. another possible reason why you could be feeling short of breath is that there is a possibility that you are anemic. normally, as part of routine prenatal care we check your blood count as well is a test for gestational diabetes somewhere between 24 and 28 weeks. if you've not yet had this test, it might be a good idea to mention your symptoms to your doctor. of course, there can be some serious, dangerous things that can cause shortness of breath; like blood clots that spread to your lung, or fluid in the lungs and other pulmonary problems. if you experience any chest pain or severe shortness of breath or start developing a productive cough, you should notify your doctor immediately and possibly go to the hospital for evaluation. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

sent to the dentist got a novocain shot on the upper left quad area and a blood vessel was punctured ... it was to until a couple of days later a was black and blue and swollen in my left jaw and tender .... still have some swelling could it be blood settled in the area ? it a been like a or and half ...,1,18055,"hi dear, welcome to chat doctor. understanding your concern. as per your query you have swollen bump on upper left side of palate which is painful and causing difficulty in swallowing is nothing just an irregular shaping of the hard palate bone. it is a palatal torus, which is a normal overgrowth of bone on the roof of mouth. sometimes food or toothbrush can scrap the tender tissue stretching over the torus causing pain. if it is very near to tooth and gingival recession is there then it could be due to calculus deposits in and around tooth of that area. need not worry. it is a self-correcting pathology if it is a palatal torus and will attain normal shape soon. if it is really troubling you then removal is the best treatment option in that case. upper denture is also made to cover this torus area to prevent irritation and ulceration on it again and again. visit dentist once and get it examined properly. if it is calculus related proper cleaning and scaling is required in that area. antimicrobial mouth wash is required on daily basis. once that area will be clean swelling will subside and your symptoms will resolve immediately. hope your concern has been resolved. get well soon. best wishes,"

hello my dad was recently diagnosed with stage 2 non small cell carcinoma with poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma he under went a biopsy of his left lung where a 6cm tutor was found sitting next to his pulmonary artery and of course they did washings that came back negative for cancer but the doctors decision was to go in there and remove the lung on dec 1st well now its the 5th on the day of the surgery we found out that they count remove the lung because the more was wrapped around the artery and i guess invading the heart sac and the doctor said he was thinking it is stage 3a my question is can the tutor being wrapped around his artery kill him over time ? they plan to do some treatments after 6 weeks of him healing from the surgery i just want a straight answer what can happen please let me know thanks,1,105897,"hi. to begin with, the treatment that your husband has undergone seems to be correct medically, more or less. to begin with he was suffering from locally advanced prostate cancer which was downstage and then surgically removed. however, he had a relapse of his disease in the bones and was placed on hormonal treatment. he seemed to be suffering from hormone resistant prostate cancer which can occur in 10% patients to start with. thus, he failed to respond to most of the treatments and eventually died of his disease. at every stage of progression, doing a scan is not mandatory. just a rising psa and symptoms are enough to know that the disease is progressing. doing a scan only documents that the disease has spread to a particular part. it will neither change the treatment nor the outcome. the blood was basically because of 2 reasons. one the disease in the lung which can commonly lead to bleeding on its own of varying quantity. added to that was the fact that he was in liver failure which further increases the chances of bleeding from any site. zynga has many side effects and one has to weigh the risks against the benefits and take a call. i assume, and you should to that the call to give zynga despite liver failure by your doctor was in good faith and based on sound judgement. i think the only part where your doctor failed you entirely was by not keeping you informed at every step the prognosis, the treatment options, the disease status and the likely outcome. it is something that i would have done and is nothing but unfortunate. while it would not have changed the outcome of your husband, it might have left you in peace after his demise. hope my answer takes care of your unrest in some measure, and you find strength enough to move on in life. take care"

"are there any doctors who are familiar with games disease and its treatment in the binghamton , of area ? by son has had a bulls eye rash for 2 weeks and its beginning to fade . of it is games , what is the correct treatment if he was bitten 2 or 3 weeks ago ?",1,59679,"hello dear. lyme disease is related to painful rashes on armpit and thigh, but may not be related to brain scarring. lyme disease is usually curable with antibiotics. this is so true that some authors of lyme disease research have stated that the most common cause of lack of response of lyme disease to antibiotics is a lack of lyme disease to begin with! the type of antibiotic depends on the stage of the disease (early or late) and what areas of the body are affected. early illness is usually effectively treated with medications taken by mouth, for example, doxycycline (tobramycin), amoxicillin (mobil), or cefuroxime acetic (certain). these generally result in a rapid cure of lyme disease. therefore, if a person finds a typical bulls-eye skin rash (described above) developing in an area of a tick bite, they should seek medical attention as soon as possible. generally, antibiotic treatment resolves the rash within one or two weeks with no long-term consequences. later illness such as nervous-system disease might require intravenous chat doctor. there are no home remedies to treat lyme disease. in those people with two or more episodes of erythema migrant rash, even years apart, it is felt that the episodes represent different infections or reinfection rather than persistence of the original infection. for relief of lyme disease symptoms, pain-relieving medicines might be added. swollen joints can be reduced by the doctor removing fluid from them (arthrocentesis). an arthrocentesis is a procedure whereby fluid is removed from a joint using a needle and syringe under sterile conditions. it is usually performed in a doctor's office. rarely, even with appropriate antibiotics, the arthritis continues. it has been suggested by researchers that sometimes joint inflammation can persist even after eradication of the lyme bacteria. this complication has been explained as an ongoing autoimmune response causing inflammation of the joint that was initially stimulated by the original bacterial infection. oral medications such as ibuprofen (motrin, turin) can also be used to reduce inflammation and improve function. there is no evidence that nonspecific fatigue that persists after treatment for lyme disease is related to persistent infection. the risks of prolonged treatments with antibiotics are far greater than any benefit in this situation. of note, recent research was done to study whether longer-term antibiotic treatment of persistent symptoms of lyme disease led to any better outcomes than shorter-term treatment. the study found that longer-term antibiotic treatment did not have additional beneficial effects on health-related quality of life beyond those with shorter-term treatment. specifically, the researchers determined that this longer-term antibiotic treatment had no more beneficial effect on fatigue, or musculoskeletal, neuropsychological, or cognitive symptoms and disorders from lyme disease than placebo hope i have answered your question. feel free to contact me if you have any more questions. i'll be glad to help you. all the besting warm regards"

a used a razor to shave a patients dry chest and than accident touched the razor with the hair pulling some of the hair off . an a get hiv/hepc this way ? a dining see any cuts initially but now 1 day later after i showered i see small nicks in fingertips . not sure from that contact or from myself after i shaved this am,1,40712,"hi, thanks for writing in. it is possible that since you had sex soon after shaving, if you have not shaved properly then there were small ends of hair sticking out of the skin which caused irritation during sex especially if the razor had an old blade. there is also the possibility of shaving itself causing such bumps if you are new to shaving and do not do shaving regularly. ingrown hair follicles can also cause a similar pattern of bumps and irritation. itching after shaving is common if you do not apply moisturizers in the region. this is because the small hairs irritate the skin. unprotected sex causing the bumps overnight is less likely a reason for your problems."

"hello , a made an implants in my lower jaw to the right side .. 2 implants .. and the doctor had to open my gum surgically to remove the remaining roots of the tooth .. this was 3 days ago .. then the doctor applied sketches and my gum is now swollen but becoming less swollen .. my main question is that i have a numbness at my lip on the right side for the previous 3 days .. is it related to the swollen gum or the implant is pressing on the nerve ? .. i called the dentist and he told me its of should be fine just take it . b12 ! and that he didst drill anything as he just put in on the place of the tooth ! ! and if it will press on the nerve it should be also with numbness in tongue .. is it true ? ? i am 33 years old .. and healthy thank god",1,44715,"hello, i can understand your concern. it would have been helpful if you had mentioned which tooth was treated for root canal. as you are mentioning that the tooth was black and had cracks in it, i am assuming that the tooth is in the lower front region, and you had had some trauma to the lower jaw area which made the tooth dead and also hurt the chin and lip. other possibility is that if the tooth was dead for many years, it may have developed a periapical cyst in relation with the tooth which might be pressing on the mental nerve supplying lower lip and chin and may cause numbness of those areas. alternatively, the numbness may have started after taking local anesthesia in the lower front area for some tooth problem and the injection might have been given deep. in any case, it seems that the nerve supplying sensation to the lower front area of jaw along with lower lip and chin (mental nerve) is damaged. usually, if the nerve is damaged, it can regenerate in 3-6 months and the sensations can return. if you are not sure regarding the crown on the tooth, you can avoid it for some months and take care not to bite hard things with that tooth so that it does not fracture. you can get the crown after the numbness is solved. i would also advise you to visit an oral and maxillofacial surgeon for the examination of the area and regarding numbness. he/she might take an x-ray to rule out presence of periapical lesion or cyst in relation with the tooth. crown should surely be postponed until this possibility is ruled out. i hope this information helps you. thank you for choosing chat doctor. i wish you feel better soon. best,"

(there's nothing much you can do to avoid, but just be vigilant to identify things early).2. get regular usg to make sure the left kidney is fine.3. it is possible for the right kidney function to reduce further as the child grows. this is because the left kidney will grow normally while your right won't. most of the time, the left kidney will enlarge and take up the extra-work. just monitor his bp and if it goes out of range, get him treated."

my son is 2 and was diagnosed with an eye virus . i can not remember the name of it . the or said it was like pinkeye but worse . the infection started as a small red blood shot spot on his eye and 24 hrs later the entire eye was blood red then 24 hrs later the other eye was completely red . no white of the eye can be seen now . we continue to use the eye drops he prescribed . i am just wanting to know the name of the virus for research . thank you,1,78380,"i am pleasure to answer your question. the red spot you see is most likely a small blood vessel. in medical terms, it is called a subconjunctival hemorrhage. small blood vessels lie underneath the conjunctiva, the clear coating that covers the sclera, the white part of the eye. but most often feel no pain, irritation or light sensitivity. a subconjunctival hemorrhage can occur if a person has too much pressure on the upper part of the body or head. pressure can be created by straining too hard while lifting something very heavy or coughing or sneezing. straining during constipation can also cause enough pressure to burst a blood vessel in the eye. other causes are high blood pressure, diabetes, trauma or a high dosage of blood thinners, such as aspirin. if a red spot in your eye lasts for longer than a few days, you should schedule an eye exam. your eye doctor will try to determine the cause of the subconjunctival hemorrhage. hope it is helpful."

a have a burning pain in my right pinky toe . it feels like a lighter is held to my toe and then pulled away . this has been going on for over 1 year . a also have swelling in both my feet on occasion . a a really frustrated cause a be been telling my doctor and he keeps prescribing gaza something which has no effect on my pain at all . an you suggest a treatment ?,1,13930,"hello, and thank you for your question. fortunately, you probably do not have fibromyalgia. there are several possible causes of pain just in the toe. if there is a pinched nerve in the lower spine, it can cause pain that can be just in one toe. if this is the case, you may find that the pain is worse with change in position, such as lying flat or standing up. pain in the toe, typically the big toe, is common in a disorder called gout, in which the body has too much uric acid. the pain usually lasts a few days at a time, and is usually associated with redness and swelling. pain in the toes can be caused by corns or other skin problems that look small but feel very severe. pins and needles, shooting, on-and-off pains can be caused by irritation to a nerve by diabetes, by lack of vitamins such as b12, or by pressure - similar to the ""foot falling asleep"" feeling we sometimes get if we cross our legs too long. fibromyalgia, on the other hand, is usually a ""pain all over"" problem - back pain, neck pain, arm pain, knee pain, without another cause such as arthritis. it usually does not cause just one part of the body to hurt - most patients say that ""everything hurts"". in my practice, i start with finding out as much as i can from the patient about how the pain feels and how long it has been going on, and if it seems related to anything else. then we examine the foot to look for anything going on with the skin, check if the nerves of the foot are normally sensitive, not as sensitive as usual, or more sensitive, and then we may check blood tests to detect diabetes or vitamin deficiency or other problems as needed. fibromyalgia is diagnosed by obtaining a careful history of where the patient is having pain, other medical problems, and completing a physical exam including what is called a ""painful point"" exam where the doctor pushes at certain places in the body - on the back and near the joints - to see if this causes pain. i hope that my answer to your question is helpful. if you have any further questions, please check back with us. i hope your toe is much better soon."

i have 3 genetic blood clotting disorders . a got a dot in my calf when i was pregnant with my last child almost 4 yrs ago . a took lovenox during the remainder of pregnancy and for 2 myths after . a now take a baby aspirin a day and fish oil . by question is : is it safe for me to take over the counter chatdoctor drops ? or will they increase my risk for clots ? a need to lose 80-100 lbs,1,10194,"hello and i hope i can help you today. baby aspirin (81 mg dose) is literally an aspirin dose that is safe for child chat doctor. it is commonly prescribed during pregnancy as a mild blood thinner for prevention of different disorders during pregnancy, like recurrent miscarriage, preeclampsia and others. it is very safe and even though it is not recommended to take adult dose aspirin during pregnancy, this dose is safe and also may help the prognosis of your current pregnancy. so you need not worry at all about the medication and its effects on the baby. however, it concerns me that you are being treated with this medication without actually knowing the cause of death of your last child. i do not know if an autopsy was performed on the baby or if you had any tests after the baby died. stillbirth can be caused by a number of factors, some due to maternal clotting disorders, infection, birth defects or complications with the pregnancy itself that may not be helped or prevented by just taking aspirin. in addition, many practitioners would recommend monitoring of your babies heartbeat in the doctor's office on a regular basis (non-stress test) to watch for any signs of distress before the baby is born. so in summary, the aspirin you were prescribed is safe but may not be beneficial to you if the death of your baby was unexplained. tests like screening of your blood for thrombophilia (inherited disorders of blood clotting) and infections (torch liters) really should be done if you haven't done so already to make sure that your aspirin treatment is not the only thing that can be done to help prevent complications with this pregnancy. consultation with a high-risk pregnancy doctor (also called a dermatologist) may be helpful in figuring out if you have a condition that can adversely affect this pregnancy. i hope that this information was helpful and that i was able to answer your question. best wishes for the rest of your pregnancy,"

hi my mon just had a surgery about a week ago . today she had went to the or because she was bleeding from the vaginal area . they said she was an acute infection of female upper reproductive tract and postoperative vaginal bleeding . can this be cause by a dog ?,1,90582,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. unfortunately, there are many kinds of viral illnesses that can make you shiver and feel cold even if the body temperature is not elevated, however a fever needs to be ruled out, especially if her admission to the hospital was a few days ago. so i suggest someone in the home purchase a thermometer and take her temperature. if it is above 38 degrees celsius (or 100.4 fahrenheit) she should call her ob provider to see if she needs to go back to the hospital. if her fever is not elevated, she may just be cold, so lots of blankets, hot tea and warm clothing will make her feel better, and it may just take time for her to get over this illness. make sure she chat doctor. if the baby isn't moving like usual, or if she has any abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding or leakage of fluid, she should return to the hospital to be evaluated. i hope i was able to answer your question today and they my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"i , a have 5-6 days to go before my next period , but 10 days ago , we tried to conceive . this is my 10th day after unprotected intercourse ( around ovulation time ) and a have a reddish urine and stool in the early morning . is it indicative of implantation bleeding ? it did not pain and a have never experienced this before . , however a am concerned . should a wait for a missed period to get a pregnancy test or get to a doctor ?",1,31972,"hallow dear, there is a lot of misconception. firstly, if you had menses from 10th to 15th, 18th is the day 8 of your cycle. the fertile window usually lies between day 10 to day 20 of the cycle (see below). so the chances of becoming pregnant are very remote. moreover, it is impossible for the nurse to diagnose a pregnancy on day 10 of the cycle after menses. the egg is yet to be released. the egg is released (ovulation) 14 days before the next expected menses. egg lives for 24 hours and sperms are active for 72 hours. hence, a period of about 8 to 10 days around this day of ovulation is considered as fertile window. so on 20th your ovulation also had not taken place. how can you become pregnant? no test for pregnancy will reveal pregnancy as it is not there. please wait for the menses. if you have few more intercourse in the fertile window, you will have chances to conceive and then 8-10 days after the missed period, your urine test for pregnancy will detect it. of course, beta chat doctor tests can give reliable results within 2-3 days of missed period. best wishes,"

"hi my name is kat and i have a question i would like to ask.me and my husband have been trying to have a baby for the past month or so , i haven went to find out whether i am pregnant or not but i would like to know if i can be pregnant at the moment and still have the symptoms i have before my period comes on such as , discharge or sore breast and mild cramps .",1,76471,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the most common sign of pregnancy is a missed menstrual period. if you have been having unprotected sex, you are risk for pregnancy. pregnancy symptoms vary widely between women, and symptoms of breast tenderness, vaginal discharge, mood changes, spotting, bloating and the like can be present both in pregnancy and in a premenstrual state. the best way to figure out if you are pregnant or not is to perform an over-the-counter urine pregnancy test. these tests are accurate to the same degree as a urine test performed in the doctor's office, and/or positive within three weeks of conception. so in summary, if you have been having unprotected intercourse, i recommend that you perform a urine test to rule out pregnancy. if you are not pregnant, and have missed your menstrual cycle for three months, it would be prudent to see a local gun physician because hormonal imbalances and other causes may be the reason you have not menstruated for such a long time and the symptom should be evaluated. i hope that i've adequately answered your question today, and that this advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"by period started thursday , november 21st and ended on monday of this week . a just got prescribed the pill today , and would like to start taking them this sunday . that is technically 1 week later than pm supposed to start , is this of ? not planning to be sexually active for at least three weeks if that makes a difference . please help !",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"i , i had braces at my age of 25 for 8 months and retainer for next 8 months . before wearing braces my face shape was square but now it has become oval . a had braces for correctingthe upper jaw side wise teeth extended ( upper bite problem ) .can i correct this using braces or cheek implantation ?",1,31038,"hi! welcome to chat doctor. i read your query. open bite can be due to jaw relation disturbance or occlusion disturbance. extracting front four teeth won't provide a solution for this. you need to visit an orthodontist, who will study your jaws and teeth, take few x-rays and then decide the treatment. usually teeth alignment is done using braces for 9-12 months varying from case to case. extraction of one or more premolar may be required for making space. then fixed braces will be attached to teeth exerting required force to move teeth in desired alignment.nowadays composite braces are available, which are esthetically better. hope the answer helps you. thank you!"

(the amount of platelets in the bloodstream is reduced because the spleen is busy trapping them). so usually people with cirrhosis end up having a problem with portal hypertension and an enlarged spleen, and a reduced platelet count in the bloodstream. as time goes by, the liver may try to repair itself by growing new cells. if there is a lot of scar tissue already present the new cells grow between scar tissue (and result in abnormal nodules). the nodules and scar tissue further interfere with blood flow through the liver. so over time people with advanced cirrhosis can end up having a problem with more and more abnormal nodules and scar tissue forming which interferes even more with blood flow through the liver which makes the spleen continue to enlarge, and the platelet count continue to chat doctor. the splenomegaly is usually not reversible. please go for regular medical follow up. hope this helps"

"i my husband a are trying to conceive our second child . be is currently taking levothyroxine ( hypothyroid ) , trileptal ( seizures ) and losartan potassium ( high blood pressure ) . by question is does any or all of these drugs interact with his sperm count , shape , motility , etc ? be have a 4 year old daughter which we conceived pretty easy , but now with the second we seem to be trying harder . be is 39 , a am 34 . thanks for any advice .",1,43820,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, i want to reassure you that no matter what your endometrial measurement may be, 80% of couples will conceive within one year naturally. couples are not diagnosed as infertile until you have been trying and been unable to become pregnant for over one year. endometrial thickness is really only relevant in the context of couples trying to get pregnant through in vitro fertilization. the thickness of your uterine lining is somewhat related to your estrogen levels. when couples are undergoing ivf, treating with additional estrogen can thicken the uterine lining. however, because you've been only trying to get pregnant for four months, your endometrial lining may have absolutely nothing to do with the reason why you have not yet conceived. furthermore, unless your husbands' sperm count has been shown to be decreased, magazine should not have any effect on fertility nor should affect any health of a developing baby should you conceive. medications taken during pregnancy by the mother can affect the fetus, but not any medication taken by the father, because medication cannot be transmitted before fertilization through sperm. so unless the medication causes the sperm count to be low or abnormal, there is no medical reason why your husband needs to be off his medication for colitis in order for you and need to conceive successfully. i suggest that if he needs the medication for his health that he continue to take it. as for is maximizing your chance of healthy pregnancy, the best thing you can do is get plenty of sleep, eat a well-balanced diet, take prenatal vitamins, and tried to have regular(at least 2 to 3 days a week) unprotected intercourse from the time your menstrual period finishes until you begin to feel premenstrual symptoms. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and i wish you and your husband the best of luck in conceiving. best wishes,"

live been taking birth control pills for three months now . i was on my period for two of those three it recently stopped a few days ago until i had unprotected sex last night ( no condom ) he pulled out but this morning i started spotting again but it started out as brown discharged and its only blood when i pee . is that something i should be worried about or is it normal . pm calling my doctor tomorrow to set an appointment for more birth control . but i was wondering if it could mean that i might end up pregnant and he might not of pulled out quick enough or if its just my body because i was on the repro shot for two years . i done know and i cant ask my parents for help because they will freak on me and i would really like an answer like really soon please . a just want to know if it could mean that i might end up being pregnant or not . i know its way to early to test . unless blood tests could be done and they could tell this early or not . i done know in new to all of this . in 20 and he is the 3rd guy live ever been with and live had sex many times but it was our first time together and live never once had this problem before .,1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"i , well this is hard to explain , my gum is a little swollen and it hurts , only in one spot though , in the very back , and i noticed that between my tooth and the gum there was something stuck there , as soon as i take it out it was something white that did to have a normal smell , i don to know if it could be rests of food or what , i need help , also i would like to know , i be been very paranoid because some of my tooth feel just a little bit loose , should i be worried ?",1,53390,hi. can understand your concern. as per your complaint the swollen gum and the white material inside it is a result of some inflammation. there can be a few reasons depending upon whether it is the second molar or the wisdom tooth. in case it is a wisdom tooth which is erupting or is impacted then the gum above it can get infected and inflamed due to either food deposition between the gum and the wisdom tooth or it can be due to gum flap bitten by the opposite jaw tooth and the condition is known as peritonitis. the white material in it is pus. in case it is second molar the swollen gum with white material in it can be as a result of infection in the gums due to deposits on the teeth like plaque or calculus or due to foreign body impaction in the gums which carries infection along with it deeper into the gums causing pus formation. it can also be due to deeply infected tooth causing pus formation below the tips of the roots of the tooth causing swelling on the gums with pus inside. i would suggest you to consult a dentist and get evaluated for the exact cause of the swelling and get treated accordingly. in case if it is wisdom tooth either excision of gum flap or extraction if the tooth is impacted followed by antibiotics and painkillers can be done. in case of gum infection professional cleaning of teeth followed by antibiotics and gum paints can help. in case of tooth infection root canal treatment or extraction depending on the condition of the tooth can be done. hope your query is solved. if you find the answer helpful please write a positive review and click on find this answer helpful as a token of appreciation. thanks and regards. chat doctor.

(pleuritic). it is important to have it checked out promptly to assess the extent of damage. in certain cases, your airways may also get inflamed and will compromise your breathing (life-threatening). other causes include a local infection of the lung, or a muscle pull. if this continues for more than a few hours or worsens, and you experience and breathing difficulty or air hunger (you cant seem to breathe enough), dizziness, swelling of your eyes, tongue, mouth, face, visit the er right away and do not chat doctor. hope this helps. please contact us if you have further questions. wish you good health"

"husband had severe chest pain yesterday . prove himself to of . tabs , ekg and a ray all normal . follow up with of in the morning . had more chest pain in the afternoon yesterday that lasted about 20 minutes . today on and off nausea as well as dizziness . should we return to of right away ? or see of in the morning ?",1,34928,"hello. welcome to chat doctor, and thank you for your question. i understand your concern. pain in the chest can have different origins, which include also the locomotion system, i.e. muscles, joints and ribs. now, every time we work out, even if we do not include the between rib (intercostal) muscles, suffices that we have heavy breathing and this can cause intercostal muscle soreness, which is mostly reflected as pain. if you try to cough, and you get the pain, then it is probably this diagnosis. as all other episodes with muscle soreness, no special treatment is required, as it goes away in few days. according to your age, my opinion is that cardiac and pulmonary origin of this pain is less likely. however, just to be secure and ""in the safe"", i would recommend you to do an ekg, as there sometimes are inflammations of cardiac lining (pericardium) which do not have an age predilection and can happen in all ages, especially after an episode with flu or other forms of infection. just to be clear, my suspicion that this is the case is very low, but i recommended the ekg to securely exclude this as an origin of your pain. as about the waves of dizziness, i would be more comfortable answering this question if i had more details, because dizziness is a symptom that may have various origins. it probably is, in this case, from over loading of physical activity and, in this case, no further examination is required. i would recommend you to take two to three days off from working out, and see if these bouts of dizziness happen again. i hope this helps. take care. best regards,"

a had a root canal a few days ago a was in extreme pain and went to see what the cause was he did two rout canals for two very deep cavities the next day my jaw was still hurting and had become swollen the dentist gave me antibiotics and sent me home a went to the or that night because a kept throwing up the antibiotics they put an of of water and pain pills and a dose of antibiotics and sent me home a now a have a giant puss ball under my gums this is two days after the or visit what shut a do,1,57412,"hi, i couldn't help respond after reading your post. i have eczema and had the same problems you described. approximately two years ago, i contracted a steph infection from working in the hospital. i had this infection for the least two years. i went to several specialists, and they all kept saying it was contact dermatitis and gave me anti-inflammatory creams and steroids. after becoming very weak and itchy all over, i couldn't take it anymore. i finally chat doctor. i was finally diagnosed with a skin steph infection. he said it was caused from me itching from my eczema that the bacteria entered my skin and it's not uncommon for doctors to misdiagnose. i was given bacterium antibiotic cream to put on the affected areas and also bacterium antibiotics pills. i was told that the doctor should have known that there was an infection going on because my skin was warm to the touch and also my c-reactive protein level in my blood was high. it does sound like you might have an infection. treat it with antibiotics, bacterium the for a month or so and you should find yourself feeling better. good luck"

"by husband suffers ( extremely ) from pseudo gout . that caused too much calcium in the blood & is there anything other than prescription beds to help get rid of , or prevent this ? it is getting to be almost a weekly occurrence . is joints are becoming permanently damaged .",2,13930,"hello, and thank you for your question. fortunately, you probably do not have fibromyalgia. there are several possible causes of pain just in the toe. if there is a pinched nerve in the lower spine, it can cause pain that can be just in one toe. if this is the case, you may find that the pain is worse with change in position, such as lying flat or standing up. pain in the toe, typically the big toe, is common in a disorder called gout, in which the body has too much uric acid. the pain usually lasts a few days at a time, and is usually associated with redness and swelling. pain in the toes can be caused by corns or other skin problems that look small but feel very severe. pins and needles, shooting, on-and-off pains can be caused by irritation to a nerve by diabetes, by lack of vitamins such as b12, or by pressure - similar to the ""foot falling asleep"" feeling we sometimes get if we cross our legs too long. fibromyalgia, on the other hand, is usually a ""pain all over"" problem - back pain, neck pain, arm pain, knee pain, without another cause such as arthritis. it usually does not cause just one part of the body to hurt - most patients say that ""everything hurts"". in my practice, i start with finding out as much as i can from the patient about how the pain feels and how long it has been going on, and if it seems related to anything else. then we examine the foot to look for anything going on with the skin, check if the nerves of the foot are normally sensitive, not as sensitive as usual, or more sensitive, and then we may check blood tests to detect diabetes or vitamin deficiency or other problems as needed. fibromyalgia is diagnosed by obtaining a careful history of where the patient is having pain, other medical problems, and completing a physical exam including what is called a ""painful point"" exam where the doctor pushes at certain places in the body - on the back and near the joints - to see if this causes pain. i hope that my answer to your question is helpful. if you have any further questions, please check back with us. i hope your toe is much better soon."

"hi my name is aaaaa from trinidad & tobago both of my tubes have cysts and i tried birth control to regulate my periods but i don to see my periods every month and i haven to seen it or the year i am 25years old and i want to know what i can take to bring my periods regular and get me pregnant , i was and have never gotten pregnant all the try i tried please help me doctor the safe way to please thank .",1,15745,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. first, if you are late for your shot and have had unprotected sex, even if you are bleeding, you should do a urine pregnancy test. if your pregnancy test is negative, many women do not have regular periods come back after discontinuing the depo-provera injection for even up to 6 months. this, however, does not mean that you cannot become pregnant. if you are not actively trying to get pregnant, a good way to help regulate your cycles until your own body resumes a regular cycle is by taking birth control pills. birth control pills make you get a light, regular, predictable cycle every month and will help control breakthrough bleeding (the brown staining you have all the time). many women have irregular bleeding in the first 6 months to a year of using the shot, and unfortunately the same thing can happen after you discontinue it. so, in summary, all the irregular bleeding you are having is likely due to your discontinuing the demo shot. if you need contraception, the monthly cycle birth control pill would be a good option that can also help you have regular cycles. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"hello . that heath implications can come from impacted wisdom tooth ? have lower on its side under gum . been ill for past 3 or so months , tinnitus , sore ears , throat at times , sore eyes , headaches , light headed , very fatigue . wanting to know how much may me related . passed week had smelly like discharge of blood . been rinsing with salt water . small gum lump over impacted tooth . any help good . surgery is booked in a month time .",1,5711,hi. thanks for the query as per your complaint sore throat can be seen associated with wisdom tooth related infection and inflammation as the area of wisdom teeth is very close to throat and inflammation from wisdom tooth can even make the throat sore and painful. but runny nose is not commonly seen with sore throat if it is related to wisdom tooth and can be due to other causes like sinus infection or upper respiratory infection. so for this you can consult a physician and get evaluated. for tender gum around wisdom tooth that seems to be due to peritonitis which is inflammation of gum flap due to food accumulation and infection between gum flap and tooth. whether tooth is impacted or not can be ruled out with x-ray. for this consult an oral physician and get evaluated and an x-ray of the tooth will be done.first to reduce infection the area will be irrigated with antiseptic solution followed by a course of antibiotics like augmenting and anti-inflammatory painkillers like ibuprofen. warm saline gargle will also help. once the inflammation reduce then if the wisdom tooth is not impacted then it will be left to erupt. in case if the tenderness recurs then the gum flap will be removed to prevent recurrence. if the tooth is impacted then extraction is the best line of treatment. hope this helps. regards.

"i sir , one month before i was bitten by a dog , but there was no bleeding and very minute skin was ruptured ( not easily seen ) at that day i rushed to the hospital and doctor prescribed me for antibiotic tablets at that time the small puppy was looking like good but within 10 days it was died . so i am fearing that i could be a patient of rabies , what should i do ? can i be infected ? are there any chances of such condition ? should i get vaccinated ? which vaccine and how many doses ?",1,79223,"hi & welcome. i can understand your concern for your beloved mother. since, at the time of bite your dog was not vaccinated so there's a possibility of being infected with rabies. dogs uniformly begin to sicken and die within 10 days of spread of rabies virus from the cns to the salivary glands. that's why a healthy domestic dog that bites a person should be confined and observed for 10 days. dogs that exhibit any sign of illness should be evaluated by a veterinarian and reported to the local health department. if your dog does develop any signs of illness, it should be euthanized and its head shipped under refrigeration to a laboratory certified to perform rabies testing (most often a public health laboratory). if your dog remains healthy for the full 10 days, then it did not have rabies virus in its saliva at the time of exposure. besides, your mother should be given 4 doses (injections) of anti rabies vaccine on day 0, 3, 7, & 14. if the dog remains healthy after 10 days, the fourth dose of 14 days need not be given. hope this answers your query."

"a done have a final diagnosis yet . a thought a was having rib problems , but when they took rays , my rib was fine and a appear to have swollen nodules on my left lung . a have pain on the left side of my chest . it started with a burning pain just under my left breast . by left side is swollen from under my left breast around to to left side of my back . a have the burning pain almost all the time and sharp stabbing pains occasionally . they are going to do a cat scan , but a admit to being scared . by step-father died of lung and liver cancer and it want pretty . it takes two vicodan at night to sleep .",1,82366,"hello friend, thank you for posting your query through chat doctor. i am a homeopath answering your query and the answer which i am going to give you may contain several thoughts which may appear strange or new for you. this i say because homeopathy is a new system of medicine and is almost unheard by the majority of the population. therefore, due to the high influence of the conventional medicine the people at large are brainwashed to believe and act according to the health education given by them. coming back to the fibroadenoma of your left breast in the year 1979, you had a psychological conflict in the mind level. you are a sensitive individual and that is why your left breast was affected. it must have been related with your child chat doctor. the sensitivity is genetic, and you reacted to the conflict through the brain according to a genetic programming. mind-brain - organ affection resulted in the development of a lump in your left breast in 1979. you consulted your gynecologist, and he suggested that it may turn to become cancerous in future and so it is better to remove it, and you subdued to his suggestion. actually the lump in the breast was an attempt of the body to cure you, or it was the result of a self defense mechanism. since you had not resolved the conflict in the psychological level, the lump remained there without getting resolved. but the body kept the lump protected in a cyst with minimum amount of inflammation called chronic cystitis. by removing the fibroadenoma or chronic cystic mastitis, you were not cured, but your lump in the breast was removed. in 1995 also you are the same person, you are the same sensitive person, and you underwent another more serious psychological conflict and the same left breast was again affected in a more serious manner. instead of recognizing the mass as a defense mechanism, you got the fear in you that you have cancer. the tissue changes also suggested that there is more serious pathology, and they labelled your lump this time as cancer and suggested removal of your left breast. if you could have recognized the lump as a defense mechanism and if you had no fear of cancer, you could have retained your breast. but the fear of cancer is such that it is associated with death and so you lost your breast. in no case, either by removal of lump in 1979 or by removal of your breast in 1995, you are not cured only your disease is cured. hope by this time you have got the answer for your query. both are related to each other because they are in the same individual, same sensitivity, same program. homeopathy cures the person and once the individual is cured all his diseases will be cured. with best wishes,"

"i , a a 27 years old . a a trying for a baby for the last few months .. a have regular period ( 26-27 days ) . by last cycle date is 29th november . by doctor said that an egg has released on 15 day of my cycle . since last two weeks a have a pain over my left ovary . by period is actually due between 24-25 december . but nothing has come out yet . should a wait further ? regards noumea",1,72620,"hallow dear, the duration of pregnancy when counted from the last menstrual period is 280 days or 9 calendar months and 7 days. in fact the egg is released (ovulation) 14 days prior to the next expected menses; i.e. if the cycle is of 30 days the egg will be released on day 16 of the cycle. the egg has 24 hours life while the sperms are active for 72 hours. hence, the conception can happen about a week around the day of ovulation. considering this, for practical purpose we consider 2 weeks less from the day of ovulation (or conception). so the pregnancy precisely is of 266 days. however, for the sake of convenience, we calculate it as 280 days from the last menstrual period date. considering these facts, if the delivery date is to be expected on september 30, the last menstrual period date should be 23 december. (would you be having it then?) now your cycle is of 30 days period. so the expected date of ovulation should be 07 january. hence, if the conception takes place on 07 january, the due date of delivery would be 30 september. the hitch here is that you should have ovulation taking lace on 07 january. moreover, we have noticed that all the pregnancies do not last for 280 days. the delivery can take place any time between 3 weeks earlier to 1 week later than the expected due date of delivery. keeping these facts and calculations in mind, you may plan your sexual relations accordingly. i hope this will help you."

"for about three days now my chest has had a mild pain on the left side . when a do certain movements , for example , bending over , i can feel a sort of sloshing or gurgling inside . also a get a pain in my neck when my blood gets pumping from doing physical activity .",1,48791,"hi, thank you for providing the brief history of you. a thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised. as your chief complaint is that when you walk there is a sharp pain in the lateral side of the left foot, i suspect it to be muscular pain or either neuropathic pain for which a thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised. also. when there is a nerve impingement in the lumbar spine, it all starts with the pain in most cases on the lateral side of the foot. as you even mentioned that you had a bony injury in the past, there might be a tendency of abnormal gait during that time and shortening of muscles of the spine due to walking in pain. as i feel, by strengthening the muscles of the core, spine, pelvic floor and lower limbs on both sides you should be able to walk. since the nerve impingement gives the initial symptoms as pain in the lateral side of the foot and progresses over a period of time. so before it gets more on future you can get an mri of lumbar spine and them proceed with physical therapy for the lumbar spine. in my clinical experience i see cases who initially comes with this sort of pain and later with nerve impingement diagnosis. so, from past couple of years i have noticed that this is the first alerting symptom of the neurological pain, so now i deal with first an mri of spine and core stability. results come on 3-4 weeks of time and post which in future complaints are less regards jay in chat doctor."

in the year 2009 gall blooded operated .after that operation my health is not good . stool passes 4/5 time in a day . off and on loose motion is there . what type of food is to be taken and what is the solution ? my hair also disturbed . it is gradually thin .,1,70703,your child could have got a gastrointestinal infection which is the likely cause of his loose motion. it is also possible that he is still not used to the new kind of food and hence the passage of loose stools. the bubbles are due to bacterial degradation of undigested food in the intestines and hence support this fact. let me assure you that the child can pass stool after every feed due to a phenomenon called gastronomic reflex which is absolutely normal and there is nothing to be worried about. zinconia or zinc supplements help in the repair of the thin inner lining of the intestines (intestinal epithelium) which gets damaged during episodes of loose stools and hence needs to be given for a few days. enterogermina contains beneficial bacteria that reside in our intestines and may help in controlling the loose stools.

if any patient a ca-125 result is showing 465 u/ml . how swear it is ? is this result is curable ?,1,45991,"welcome to chat doctor ca-125 465 u/l is quite high. it is not possible to interpret the meaning of an abnormally high ca 125 without additional information about the particular patient being evaluated. the reason is that blood levels of this protein can be increased in many benign and malignant conditions. in the patient who is being evaluated for a pelvic mass, a ca 125 level greater than 65 is associated with malignancy in approximately 90% of cases. however, without a demonstrable mass, the association is much weaker. if it is due to ovarian cancer treatment depends upon stage of cancer. treating gynecologist/oncologist will be in better situation to comment on prognosis(curability). take care."
if any patient a ca-125 result is showing 465 u/ml . how swear it is ? is this result is curable ?,2,35929,"hello, thanks for using chat doctor. ca 125 as you already know is a marker for cancer. it increases in cancers of the digestive system and those of the reproductive system including the ovaries, fallopian tubes, endometrium of uterus etc. it is highly used in the diagnosis and follow-up of ovarian cancer. ca 125 is not specific to a particular disease and does not necessarily indicate a malignant disease. it could be elevated in benign conditions such as uterine fibroid as well. from your history; heavy menses, anemia, enlarged uterus etc., there is a good chance that what you have is a uterine fibroid. the only problem is that the ca 125 level is far above the normal which is 35 (300 in your case). the appearance of uterine fibroid on ultrasound is particular, and you should see your ultrasonographer to say if the mass was not well round and with borders and characteristic of fibroid. if it's a fibroid or none metastasized cancer, hysterectomy will be just fine. best regards and hope this helps. chat doctor."
if any patient a ca-125 result is showing 465 u/ml . how swear it is ? is this result is curable ?,3,83238,"hi, thanks for writing in. cancer antigen 125 is a substance that is produced in the ovary, fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, and the lining of the chest and abdominal cavities (the pleura and the peritoneum). the ca 125 level measures a sugar protein that may be released when cells are inflamed or damaged. ca 125 levels under 35 ku/ml are considered normal. since the ca 125 rise can occur in inflammation therefore a common cold and sinusitis can certainly cause a slight rise in the level. i suggest that she takes treatment for the sinusitis and repeats the ca 125 level after a month when she is free of symptoms. this will help guide her during the next follow-up visit with the oncologist. please do not worry."

a had undergone a acute appendicitis operation approximately a month ago . it was a open surgery and the stitches were of the dissolvable type . after my operation i feel fine no pain in my stomach area but like recently from last two days live been having itching sensation along the stitches and today there was pus not much but very little almost a drop . should i be worried ?,1,21659,"hello. and i hope i can help you today. you had an incision made in the opening of your vagina to help your baby pass, called an episiotomy. it was sutured at the delivery and normally takes 6 weeks to heal completely. the stitches dissolve by themselves by 6 weeks, so they do not need to be removed. being on your feet is not really a risk for injuring your sutures, so you do not need to worry about your visits to the nicu. symptoms of infection in the area include increased pain over time, green pus discharge and redness. so as long as you keep the area clean, and refrain from sexual activity, the area should heal normally in 6 weeks. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"
