i have a history of kidney stones and lately over the last 3 days or so i have become very sleepy nauseated and its hard to pee . i have had pain in both sides of my back near the kidneys mostly on my right side wrapping to the front a mild fever ... is this a kidney stone ?,2,34445,"hi, thanks for writing in. the collecting system of the kidney is made of renal calyxes and pelvis. this collects the urine formed in kidney and transports it through the ureter (tubes connecting kidneys and urinary bladder) to the urinary bladder. the pelvicalyceal system is the mouth of the kidney where it connects with the upper end of the ureter. i guess that you have got ultrasound scan done, and it shows mild fullness of the pelvicalyceal system in the left kidney, that is a term applied to increase in diameter of the collecting system in your left kidney. it is not a critical situation, and please do not worry if you do not have any urinary symptoms. since it is mentioned as mild fullness and no kidney stones have been found, therefore(i) it can be that your bladder was completely full at the of ultrasound scan(ii) your kidney pelvicalyceal system is appearing full by itself (extrarenal pelvis) and is an extension of normal appearance.(iii) rarely an infection of urinary system and kidneys (recent or old) can cause such a finding, but this is likely only if you have symptoms like pain in the region of kidney and problems like burning urination or discoloration of urine or any kidney infections in the past.(iv) stones in kidney or ureter can also cause fullness of pelvicalyceal system and since you do not have any stone therefore this does not apply to you. it is important to know if your scan was repeated after passing urine and still there was persistent mild fullness of the pelvicalyceal system on left side. this can also be confirmed by doing an mvp which is injecting a contrast and taking 5 to 6 x-rays to study the functioning of the kidneys in a better way. please consult the urologist."

"i am a 25 year old male , had a confirmed case of the flu , and had a follow up chest infection , which caused severe coughing for a 2 week period , now two weeks after getting over the infection i continue to have a rather painful ache in my back and chest but its isolated to below my scapula and just right of my sternum , live read about muscle damage caused by severe coughing , i would like to know if this is the case whats the best treatment method ?",1,44855,"greetings. welcome to chat doctor, and thank you for your question. i understand your concern. your age would help me a lot in constructing a differential diagnosis. however, i will explain some forms of chest pain, which we aim to exclude first, as the main and most dangerous organic causes of it. first, there is angina. angina is a moderate-to-severe chest pain, more characterized like a heaviness or tenderness or ""squeezing"" feeling, localized in the mid-chest, and then radiates to the both sides of the chest, the jaw, left shoulder and left arm. this is the pain originated from one or more blockages within the coronary arteries (arteries that supply the heart muscle with oxygen and nutrients). if this is your case, you should perform an ekg and an echocardiogram, and, depending on these two tests, a cardiac stress test. second, there is sharp, stabbing pain. this kind of pain can come from an enlargement of the root of the aorta and/or from aortic aneurysm. it is severe in intensity, and radiates to the back, between the wings. also, it can be caused by an acute or chronic inflammation to the linings within the rib cage, i.e. the pleura (lining of the lungs) and pericardium (the lining of the heart). this kind of pain - pleuritic pain - is less severe than that caused by aortic aneurysm, and relieves or aggravates from switching positions or the respiratory cycle. if this is the case, then echocardiogram (for pericardium and root of the aorta), chest x-ray (for the pleura and the lungs), and computed tomography of the aorta (in case we suspect that there is a problem with the aorta, higher than its root), should be performed. there is always a possibility of intercostal (between ribs) muscle or pectoral (chest) muscle soreness, and pain originated from problems with ribs and rib joints. if this is the case, you can use over the counter painkillers. i hope i was thorough with my answer. best regards."

"a have had a painful lump inside my vagina , on the posterior wall for past week . it feels rubbery and is in the area where a would have had stitches after the birth of my son 9 years ago . a am wondering if a may have developed a keloid scar here ? is this possible after so much time has elapsed ? a have had no trouble with that area until now ? that else could it be if not related to scarring from childbirth ? a am a midwife , so understand the physiology !",1,44715,"hello, i can understand your concern. it would have been helpful if you had mentioned which tooth was treated for root canal. as you are mentioning that the tooth was black and had cracks in it, i am assuming that the tooth is in the lower front region, and you had had some trauma to the lower jaw area which made the tooth dead and also hurt the chin and lip. other possibility is that if the tooth was dead for many years, it may have developed a periapical cyst in relation with the tooth which might be pressing on the mental nerve supplying lower lip and chin and may cause numbness of those areas. alternatively, the numbness may have started after taking local anesthesia in the lower front area for some tooth problem and the injection might have been given deep. in any case, it seems that the nerve supplying sensation to the lower front area of jaw along with lower lip and chin (mental nerve) is damaged. usually, if the nerve is damaged, it can regenerate in 3-6 months and the sensations can return. if you are not sure regarding the crown on the tooth, you can avoid it for some months and take care not to bite hard things with that tooth so that it does not fracture. you can get the crown after the numbness is solved. i would also advise you to visit an oral and maxillofacial surgeon for the examination of the area and regarding numbness. he/she might take an x-ray to rule out presence of periapical lesion or cyst in relation with the tooth. crown should surely be postponed until this possibility is ruled out. i hope this information helps you. thank you for choosing chat doctor. i wish you feel better soon. best,"

"i , i have found a lump on my right festival , that i have noticed this past few months , its attached to the side of my festival and is about a pea sized lump that is sore to touch .. it is only felt , you can not see it sticking out of my sack . someday it hurts without it being touched . a researched cancerous lumps , and they seem to be small numerous lumps that are visible to see sticking out the sack . should i get this checked ? a have a recent history of cancer in my family , could this lump be cancerous ? thanks",1,33931,"hi michele jacobi the first thing that has to be done once you find a lump in the region of the chest wall is to confirm what it is. in your case a biopsy has already been done and let us await its result. you're understanding that cancerous lumps don't bleed after biopsy is correct. but i think your presumption that if it was scar tissue it would have bled is not correct. scar tissue also need not bleed. needle biopsies do not usually cause any bleeding unless a blood vessel is ruptured during the procedure since how long have you noticed this lump. is the size of the lump increasing ? if the biopsy comes as positive for cancer then you will have to undergo a series of investigation to find out he the extent of the disease. ? whether it is confined to the chest wall only or whether it has gone beyond the chest wall to other regions. treatment decision will depend on the results of this if the biopsy comes as negative for cancer then there are 2 options 1- if your physician thinks it is insignificant then you need to follow it up. just keep a check on your lump to see whether it is increasing in size and also get it checked by your physician regularly2- the second option (and my preference) is to do an open biopsy especially if the lump was detected recently and is increasing in size and also if the lump is firm to hard (and not very soft). the reason is needle biopsy can be negative, but this does not always mean there is no cancer especially if the tissue sample taken is not adequate. also time factor is important. you may lose time keeping the lump under follow up to see whether it is increasing in size hope you are satisfied with my reply. anyway don't worry. follow your doctors' advice chat doctor."

a have a lump on my left breast in the same spot where a previously had a lump removed ( benign ) . a am currently pre-menstrual with tender breasts . to a need to see the doctor ? or should a wait until after a finish my period to see if the lump is still there ?,1,9393,"hi, welcome with your query to chat doctor. based on the facts of your query, as you had positive family history for cancer breast, it is but natural for you to have worry about your tender breast with armpit lump. in the context of this background, your armpit lump appears to be a fibroadenomas of the axillary tail of the breast. i would suggest you to get the surgeons opinion and fnac biopsy with homeopath study in your case, before being labelling it as a cancer of breast. in my opinion this lump in the breast appears to be fibroadenomas, as its tender and may be due to nearing menses. if not, check up with mammography with 2-3 follow-ups and hpr biopsy of the breast with armpit lump biopsy would resolve the fear accompanied by your breast and armpit lumps. remedy-after proper follow up and investigation from surgeon, if cancer is confirmed by homeopath study report, then onco-surgeon needs to be consulted, who would plan the needful treatment accordingly. if it's a benign one in both the breast and armpit lump, regular physical examination with palm of your hand and by mammography followup 3-6 they, would resolve the treatment issue in your case. in my opinion you should not worry till you get the final homeopath report after fnac biopsy of breast /and armpit lumps. will appreciate writing your feedback review comments, to help the needy patients like you at chat doctor. good day!! chat doctor. s. genl-cvts"

"they have ruled out hepatitis a , a , a , no stones in gall bladder or liver . to blood clots or blockage . does not drink alcohol but still has jaundice . they will be taking a biopsy of liver . they want to check on the copper and iron . that could be the possible outcomes from that ?",1,48942,"jaundice is not a disease, but rather a symptom or a sign that can occur in many diseases. it refers to the yellowish staining of the skin and the white part of the eyeball, caused by high levels of bilirubin in blood. bilirubin comes from red blood cells (rbc's) - when rbc's get old, they are destroyed, and hemoglobin is released from the destroyed rbc's after the iron it contains is removed - the chemical that remains in the blood after the iron is removed becomes bilirubin. the liver usually removes bilirubin from the blood along with other waste products. jaundice can be of 3 types:? pre-hepatic - increased bilirubin production which the liver in unable to remove from the blood, e.g. patients with hemolytic anemia have an abnormally rapid rate of destruction of their red blood cells that releases large amounts of bilirubin into the blood ? hepatic - defect in the liver prevents bilirubin from being removed from the blood, the most common being viral hepatitis? post-hepatic / obstructive - blockage of bile ducts decrease the flow of bile and bilirubin from the liver into the intestines, which may be due to cancer, gallstones or inflammation of the bile ducts. the treatment of jaundice usually requires a diagnosis of the specific cause of the jaundice and treatment directed at the specific cause. i suggest you contact your doctor for a detailed history and physical examination, which are important for diagnosing the cause of jaundice. bilirubin can also be measured in blood. very high levels of conjugated bilirubin relative to conjugated bilirubin suggest hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells). very high levels of liver enzymes (aspartame amino transferase / ast and alpine amino transferase / alt) suggest inflammation of the liver such as viral hepatitis. high alkaline phosphatase suggests disease or obstruction of the bile ducts. ultrasound examination of the abdomen or other imaging modalities may help to diagnose gallstones, tumors, dilated bile ducts due to obstruction, etc. weakness is a symptom associated with jaundice and takes time to settle down. adílio is the brand name of a medicine called ursodesoxycholic acid that is approved for use in certain specific gall bladder stones and chronic homeostatic liver disease due to gall bladder. limit is an ayurvedic product and i would not like to comment on it."

"hi , for the past couple days now i haven been able to keep down my food . everything i eat i feel like its just sitting in my stomach and not digesting at all . i sometimes purge to make it go away . and other times i will throw up on my own . live also had constipation and i feel as though in losing a lot more hair than i usually do . also , i have a stuffy nose and my lower to middle back has been hurting me . i haven been able to go to the doctors , so i was wondering if you can tell me what you think is wrong ?",1,61263,"welcome to chat doctor ! i have gone through your question, and there are some important concerns: you have sludge in gall bladder, fatty liver, bloating abdomen due to which you can't eat adequately. you have test done for ovarian cancer which is normal. there is no other blood test like - lipid profile, thyroid, renal function test, which will be helpful in your treatment. from my clinical experience i would say that the bloating, and fullness of stomach are due to sludgy gall bladder. food is not digested properly when there is fatty liver, and sludge in gall bladder. there is difficulty in digesting fats and other important nutrient from food, even proteins. so, what ever small you eat makes you feel heavy and full. had i been your doctor i would go for some lipid reducing chat doctor? i think you must consult a surgeon, as many times the sludgy gall bladder needs to be removed with surgery. the sludge sometimes does slip in bile duct and can result in acute abdominal pain. i'm not trying to scare you but just informing you about the possibilities as you are having significant fullness and bloating. i want to tell you that it is not a serious illness. had i been at your place, i would go for soft, non-spicy, non-oily diet. avoid food from outside unless it is thoroughly cooked. this does help in bloating. small and frequent meals also help along with medicines. please stop alcohol (if you take it!) completely as it graves the illness. i have seen antacids like omeprazole 20 mg twice a day, half hour before meals, give immediate relief. syrups like di gene can be taken as and when required, about three four times day. however, most importantly you should go and meet a doctor (preferably a surgeon). hope the answer helps you. feel free to ask more queries."

"i or . a a 32 weeks pregnant . a have the last couple weeks had an irritable uterus with brandon hicks . a just got back from my gynaecologist today and was asked to take utrogestan 100mg 3 times a day to prevent preterm labour . but when a search the web it says : utrogestan 100mg capsules are not a treatment for premature labour.prescription of progesterone beyond the first trimester of pregnancy may reveal granitic cholestasis that does this mean and what it is your opinion ? thank you ,",1,52955,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. in the first trimester of pregnancy, your ovaries produce the hormone progesterone which normally is made by the placenta once it reaches adequate size. so it is not unusual in the first trimester pregnancy to feel pain in your ovaries. in addition, as your uterus stretches, you also may experience some cramping and pulling sensations, which can be on the sides. the only thing that is concerning is if you have not had an ultrasound this pregnancy to confirm that it is normal and located in your uterus. if you already have had an ultrasound for this pregnancy it is unlikely that there could be anything harmful going on, especially if you are not bleeding. so if the pain is severe enough that you cannot function, especially if you have not yet had an ultrasound, if you cannot reach her doctor within a reasonable amount of time, you may want to pursue care in an emergency setting. if you have had a normal ultrasound earlier in this pregnancy, you really do not need to worry, as your ovaries are normally examined as part of your pregnancy ultrasound and a large cyst would've already been detected. tylenol, or acetaminophen is safe to use for pain at the normal adult dosage during all trimesters of pregnancy, and you can try to see if that helps with the pain. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

i was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the endometrium and be junction leiomyoma fro which a had radical hysterectomy - not followed by radiation or chemo . after 20 months an ultrasound indicates mildly dilated right pelvicalyceal system . now is this going to impact me ? is it something complicated ?,1,34445,"hi, thanks for writing in. the collecting system of the kidney is made of renal calyxes and pelvis. this collects the urine formed in kidney and transports it through the ureter (tubes connecting kidneys and urinary bladder) to the urinary bladder. the pelvicalyceal system is the mouth of the kidney where it connects with the upper end of the ureter. i guess that you have got ultrasound scan done, and it shows mild fullness of the pelvicalyceal system in the left kidney, that is a term applied to increase in diameter of the collecting system in your left kidney. it is not a critical situation, and please do not worry if you do not have any urinary symptoms. since it is mentioned as mild fullness and no kidney stones have been found, therefore(i) it can be that your bladder was completely full at the of ultrasound scan(ii) your kidney pelvicalyceal system is appearing full by itself (extrarenal pelvis) and is an extension of normal appearance.(iii) rarely an infection of urinary system and kidneys (recent or old) can cause such a finding, but this is likely only if you have symptoms like pain in the region of kidney and problems like burning urination or discoloration of urine or any kidney infections in the past.(iv) stones in kidney or ureter can also cause fullness of pelvicalyceal system and since you do not have any stone therefore this does not apply to you. it is important to know if your scan was repeated after passing urine and still there was persistent mild fullness of the pelvicalyceal system on left side. this can also be confirmed by doing an mvp which is injecting a contrast and taking 5 to 6 x-rays to study the functioning of the kidneys in a better way. please consult the urologist."

"to estrinwhat are the pros and cons of the birth control loestrin ? i am wanting to prevent pregnancy , clear my acne , and regulate my period . i was on a birth control called agree for two years it did a great job clearing my acne but i made the mistake of skipping two months and when i tried to go back on it i started getting yeast infections every month . live been off of birth control for one year and since then i have gained a lot of weight , i went from 160-205 , my acne came back , and my periods are very irregular . with birth control would be best for me ?",1,77098,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. many women who have been on birth control for many years can develop a tolerance of sorts for the pills' ability to control your menstrual cycle, especially after they have not menstruated for a long time due to pregnancy or another cause. this can also occur to the fact that you did relatively recently give birth, especially if you were breastfeeding. bleeding when you are not supposed to have your period on the pill is called breakthrough bleeding. it does not mean the pill is ineffective as a contraceptive, but having some irregular bleeding in between periods or a different bleeding pattern that you may have had before the pregnancy is not unusual. having heavy bleeding in the morning is likely due to the blood accumulating in your vagina during the night, and then it all comes out at once when you get out of bed due to gravity. your cycle may get back to normal after a few more months on the pill, and taking it as close to the same time every day will help to reduce the risk of breakthrough bleeding. if it continues for more than 3 months, you may benefit from changing your birth control brand to one with a slightly higher dose of estrogen, as the estrogen in the pill is the ingredient that controls your menstrual cycle. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

pm having a rather scanty period where there hardly any blood but just a lot of brown and i int have any pain with it until nighttime but the pain is only a little bit in my lower abdomen and its very sharp but the problem is on the birth control pill cerazette have been for the last 8months nearly and i shouldn't a having any periods at all,2,4405,"hallow dear, both the pills you have mentioned are birth control pills. lo lobstering fe is a low estrogen pill hence it may cause low bleeding. tri-sprintec is an average oestrogen-progesterone pill. if you were on one brand pill regularly and just change the brand without having any gap, the chances of protection are very high. moreover, the intercourse happened in the first week of menses. this is little away from the fertile period. egg release in women happens 14 days prior to next menses. considering 24 hours life of egg and 72 hours activity of sperms, a week around this day is considered as fertile period. already on birth control pills and intercourse away from the fertile period, the chances of pregnancy are very low. you have not mentioned whether you have missed period or not. missing a period is the first and cardinal symptom of pregnancy. all other symptoms appear later. your breast and nipples symptoms could be due to rough handling also. still if you are in doubt, please wait for the periods to miss. if at all it misses, then 8-10 days after that perform urine pregnancy test and/or ultrasonography for detection of pregnancy; done earlier, they may prove to be inconclusive. beta chat doctor tests are conclusive even 2-3 days after missed period. i hope you are satisfied with the explanation."

my sister had a renal stent placed today . one side is 100 % blocked . the other where the stent was placed is 90 % blocked . will she ever need the already shrunken 100 % kidney removed ? now long is the average recoup time ? she is a nurse and thinks she is going to work her 12hr shift on saturday . a say no .,1,4387,"hi, thanks for writing in. it is important to know the reason why stent was placed in your kidney and whether the stent is on one side or on both sides. stents are tin long tubes with curves in both ends. one end is in the pelvis of the kidney and the other end is in the urinary bladder. a stent helps in clear passage of urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder. if your bladder is full then the stent is clear and allowing urine to pass through. an ultrasound scan is required to know if there is any urinary bladder infection or any other cause for not being able to pass urine from the bladder to the exterior. if there is acute retention of urine then you should go to your doctor now and have the bladder pressure released by inserting a catheter. please do not worry."

i am 30 years old lady.i have one baby.i have severe dark circles around my eyes last 10 yearsdue to studies.plz can it remove it through any surgery .i have use many creams for remove it after doctors suggestions but no effect seen ..,1,96183,"i'm female 22 yrs and i also have really dark circles under my eyes. i tried all the creams and gels at pharmacies and none of them worked. i was diagnosed with vitamin b12 deficiency which causes dark under eye circles. it took me years to get a diagnosis because physicians don't generally test b12 levels especially if your cbc counts are normal. i had lots of routine blood work done, and they all came back normal. a few months ago i was experiencing severe tingling (i had other symptoms too, but the tingling was most bothersome) so i told my new doctor to test me for absolutely everything that can cause it. my b12 level came back at 30 which is extremely low. the funny thing about it was that i took b12 vitamins all the time... so my body just wasn't absorbing them. you should also consider getting tested for celiac disease - if you have symptoms associated with it - because it deprives your body of important vitamins. i'm sure there are products or something out there that helps dark circles, but it won't help if you have an underlying condition."

i today my boyfriend put the head of his penis into me for a little bit . be only had about 2inches maximum of his penis inside of me . be did not cum but there was a clear liquid coming out of the top of his penis that a wiped off before putting it into me . pm 15.5 and hes 17 almost 18 years old . a was a virgin until today . by last period ended last thursday . it was 6 days long . also he was sitting on a bench and a was onto of his lap facing him ... if that makes a difference . pm really freaking out right now and was wondering if a could be pregnant and what the odds of a pregnancy are ? also what time of the month is ovulation ? thank you so much ... nikki,1,37527,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. even though your boyfriends penis was inside you for only a short time, sperm can be present in pre-ejaculate (or pre-cum) and if you truly do not want to become pregnant it is really important to avoid any contact of the penis with your vagina during sexual play. the most fertile time of a woman cycle is in the middle, typically 14 days before your menstrual period would be due. so the time from when your period finishes until you start to feel pms symptoms is your fertile time. so in this case, since your boyfriend did not ejaculate, it still would be quite rare for you to have conceived. the most common sign of pregnancy is a late or delayed menstrual period. so in your case, you just need to wait for your period to arrive, and if it is late, you can do an over-the-counter urine pregnancy test which is greater than 99% accurate. pregnancy test do not become positive however until at least 2 to 3 weeks after conception. so in summary, your chances of having gotten pregnant in your particular situation is very, very low. for the future, please make sure that the penis is completely covered with a condom if it has any contact with the opening of your vagina. as long as the area is moist, sperm can swim all the way up your vagina from the opening and result in pregnancy. however, the amount of sperm in pre-cum is extremely low, so again i doubt that you need to be concerned about this one sexual encounter. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was helpful. best wishes,"

(we call this osmosis phenomenon). for this effect, we need to check the blood sugar at midnight around 2am or so. if this midnight glucose level is very low, then we have to decrease your night insulin levels. therefore, the best for you is to go immediately to your treating doctor and adjust the insulin dose you are taking. regards"

"a have these brown wart shape bumps on my body and they show up every.i tried to look them up on the enter net , but i cant seem to get any answers to my question , these bumps they itch really bad and hurt and and leaves red rings around them can you help me with this problem .",1,31990,"hello pt-bumps are formed due to injury caused to the tongue accidentally. you may bite your tongue or your tongue may get infected while eating any sharp food stuffs causing swelling and pain on the tongue. eating huge quantities of acidic foods can also cause bumps. it can appear on the upper layer of the tongue or on its side and sometimes at its back. eating lot of sweets and sugary items can also give rise to bump formation. it can also be caused due to disturbance in gastrointestinal tract and due to heightened stress and emotions. thus, there is every chance that underlying medical condition can cause bumps on your tongue. bumps are not contagious, but it is good to leave them undisturbed. sometimes, using hard toothbrush or rough brushing techniques of the mouth can also cause bumps and bleeding on the tongue. bumps formed due to trauma are called lie bumps. they look like tiny balls white or red, and it will cause tenderness in the tongue for many days."
"a have these brown wart shape bumps on my body and they show up every.i tried to look them up on the enter net , but i cant seem to get any answers to my question , these bumps they itch really bad and hurt and and leaves red rings around them can you help me with this problem .",2,89135,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the bumps you likely are feeling on your cervix are most likely nathan cysts rather than polyps. polyps are fleshy soft growths that are just out pouching of the normal glands that line the canal of the cervix. it would be difficult to feel them, and they usually cause irregular bleeding or bleeding after sex. they do not cause infertility (uterine polyps can, but those are not the same and are not possible to feel because they are inside your uterus. nabothian cysts are just blocked mucus glands that can feel like knobby bumps on the cervix. they also are not harmful and do not interfere with fertility. both of these findings on your cervix can be seen on a spectrum exam, so a gun doctor would be able to tell you what you are feeling if they looked inside you. also, regarding the position of your cervix, this also has no bearing on fertility and does not change from month to month, so you do not need to check your cervix regularly especially if you have a yearly gynecologic checkup. regarding bbt charting for conception, your temperature goes up after you ovulate, so i recommend not checking it anymore if you know around when you ovulate in your cycle and just have sex every other day from the time your period finishes until you feel premenstrual symptoms. some women only have sex after their temperature goes up, and they miss the actual time of ovulation. so there is no reason to suspect you will have problems conceiving, and you do not need to be treated for this because it is a normal finding in many women. 80 percent of couples will conceive within a year. if you have been having sex at the right time and it's almost a year, it might be wise to have a gun exam and a hormonal evaluation, and also have your fiancé get his sperm count checked, as 50 percent of the time it can be a male factor. i hope i was able to answer your question and that my advice was helpful. best wishes and good luck with your pregnancy plans,"

"by pleasure to meet you dr. lynne in sept. 5 , 2014 a suffered a heart attack and a had 3 stints placed and currently remains a 95 % blockage in the main aroma valve . a take several medications now , a eat right , exercise , rest and am trying not to have another heart attack . to my question to you is why is high altitude a issue with my health ?",1,37591,"hi, as you have mentioned that you had heart attack and also underwent coronary artery stenting (3 stents), there is likely possibility of compromised heart pumping (which can be assessed by 2decho, echocardiography by presence of regional wall motion abnormality and left ventricular ejection fraction, lvef).also, you have aortic valve obstruction (stenosis) which you have mentioned as 95% blockage. aortic valve stenosis is assessed by 2decho & color doppler of heart by which we can know about valve size, pressure gradient generated across heart valve by obstruction, any concomitant leakage (regurgitation). you have to avoid situations that put extra work on heart.1) physical or mental stress, which causes extra demand of blood and oxygen supply to body, which need to be fulfilled by extra work by heart which leads to increase in heart rate increased oxygen requirement there by increased blood supply to heart.2) high altitude: climbing to high altitude require physical exertion also oxygen content of air decreases with height, again at high altitude there is need for more oxygen by body and there by extra work on heart. in the presence of compromised heart pumping and significant aortic valve blockage heart can not generate adequate cardiac output (cardiac out put in simple term means blood volume pumped by heart in aorta per minute). in resting state cardiac output generated by such heart is sufficient to fulfill need for oxygen and blood of body. but when there is increased need for oxygen and blood supply of body, despite extra work heart cannot generate adequate cardiac output, and there is development of heart failure (let ventricular failure) which manifest as shortening of breath, breathlessness (doe to lung congestion), there may be swelling over legs, chest pain (heart attack). then what should you do1) continue your blood thinning medicines, antiplatelet.2) keep in control your blood pressure, diabetes, cholesterol levels if any abnormality there.3) use of diuretics that help in removing extra water from body and avoid lung congestion.4) use of medications like b blockers, ace/arms that help in preserving heart function.5) there may be need for aortic valve surgery, dilatation (vasectomy) or replacement (valvoplasty) depending on your symptomatology, pressure gradient across aortic valve, presence of concomitant aortic regurgitation. i think this information may be sufficient to solve your queries."

a am having a constant dull nagging pain in my upper arm on the back . lately a have also been having problems with tenderness around my knee area with no apparent explanation . never had these problems before . should a be concerned ? that could be the potential cause ? thanks,3,40260,dear friend generally back does not cause stomach pain. so i am trying to deal with your problem picking one problem then another.first the most common cause of back problem is muscle spasm in and around vertebral column. excessive or overuse of these muscles in the form of lifting weight or bending forwards causes back pain. so what you have to do is give rest to your muscles and do some back strengthening exercise like flexion exercise of back region. and as far as stomach pain and burning sensation is concerned it can be due to excessive acid secretion in the stomach. so regular intake of sanitizing can give you relief from this nagging pain.i hope in this way you can solve your health problems.my best wishes.thank you.

hello doctor age is 25 and i have a problem of impacted wisdom tooth.before a month had swelling and there was infection after taking some antibiotics it has reduced . but another problem is i have a problem of bad breath one of the dentist told me its probably due to wisdom tooth . can it be the reason and if so wat is the treatment . i a also carrying this the 3 month .,1,7310,"hi. thanks for the query. as per your complaint swollen tonsils can be due to throat infection that can be strep throat also and not necessarily due to impacted wisdom tooth.but in case if you have impacted wisdom tooth and the gum flap over it gets inflamed due to insufficient cleaning leading to infection can cause radiating pain in throat as well as some level of infection to neck glands leading to their enlargement and swelling. if any of the wisdom tooth is decayed and painful it can also lead to pain and swelling of lymph nodes as well as to some extent tonsils, but it is not always necessary. i would suggest you to see an ent specialist as you have recurrent episodes of consular swelling and get evaluated for the exact cause of it. if it is strep complete antibiotic course will cure the problem and if it is due to wisdom tooth an appointment with the dentist will be required to find out whether the tooth needs extraction. doing warm saline gargles can help you in both conditions whether related to wisdom tooth or tonsils. hope your query is solved. thanks and regards."

i my name is betty and in 16 a had a miscarriage 5 days ago and they said of was completed . a went back to the or recently because a am have severe abdominal pain and my belly is swollen more than it was before the miscarriage a am also having back pain . but the pain in my belly is so severe if a barely press down it hurts . it is also paining me to urinate a told the or these things and they told me nothing is wrong . a was hoping you could give me a little more insight seeing as the quack of a or a have been seeing can tell me nothing . a greatly appreciate it .,1,58987,"his am chat doctor. i have read your message. i think i can help you. first, a package test means that multiple tests are included that correlate to the test. cpk and spe can both be package tests as there are many related tests needed in a diagnosis. the symptoms that you seem to be facing as per the query is basically severe backache that increases on lying down or bending-in other words, anything that causes the spine to be under pressure. now she itself can cause the symptoms. the muscles and bone problems can arise in she itself and thus possibly one will feel that there is nothing more to do. however, in many situations, the doctors may get biased my a diagnosis. so, i think it is good that your doctor did not get biased with your pre-existing diagnosis of she and continued to look for other causes of backache. a severe backache can happen due to muscle disorders, a condition known as myopathy. the cause of myopathy may be she itself. the test commonly done to test myopathy is cpk or creatine phospholipase. this is a test done from blood. the idea is if the cpk is raised, it suggests myopathy. in this situation, your doctor will need to modify the therapy. i am unaware of your medication from the query. so i cannot really comment upon it. but some medicines themselves cause myopathy. and sometimes, the dose of existing medicines need to be stepped up for treatment of myopathy. so i presume your doctor wanted to check that. second test was spe or serum protein electrophoresis. this is one of the tests for multiple myeloma. this is a type of malignancy that affects the bones and causes bone pains and should be ruled out in middle-aged to elderly commonly if the backache is worsening and is specially bad when lying down. if the test is negative, there is nothing to worry about. if it does come out to be positive, multiple myeloma can be treated. so again you need not worry since the treatment is available. why the doctor did not tell you about the tests is something i can only speculate about. i guess it was because these are just doubts, considering you already have she- in medicine, the usual dictum is that one disease can explain the symptom, the other condition should not be sought. having said that, it's a folly to miss another diagnosis due to a pre-existing condition. i think he would have told you if the tests came out positive. so there should be nothing to worry about-the doctor was just making sure that there is no other problem. possibly since there was nothing else diagnosed, he did not tell you about it. i have tried to make it as simple as possible to understand the situation. in case there are still doubts, feel free to contact me for further details. best of luck,"

a recently got treated with very high hypertension . it seems to be under control now but by is still slightly high . when my of went up i got dizzy . now a have a numbness in my left temple and periodically my left arm . a have had blood tests and all is of . a did a heart sonar ecg and 24 hour egg all is normal . a am 55 and overweight ( lost 7 kos in the last 6 weeks 20 to go ) a am 55 year old male . any advice would be grateful,1,43362,"hello thanks for posting here. i have gone through your description. your bp seems to be persistently higher despite taking amlodipine daily. verapamil is a stronger blood control medication than amlodipine. but one of its effects is lowering the heart rate, which in your case was lowered too much hence stopped. the amlodipine you are taking is not enough to control your bp and hence it must be changed. if you were my patient, i would start you on tablet selma am which is a combination of telmisartan plus amlodipine which would be an ideal combination for you. it does not lower the heart rate and has beneficial effects on the kidney and heart. the brand name selma am may change from country to country, but telmisartan 40 mg plus amlodipine 5 mg combinations are available worldwide. you can take one tablet of selma am. it will definitely help get your pressure under control. if despite this your blood pressure remains high (after two weeks of starting selma am) you must undergo a 24-hour ambulatory bp monitoring which records your bp every 15-20 mins while you go around your daily routine activities. it gives us an idea of your pressure control, effect of medications, time of day when pressure is high, and also we can correlate high blood pressure with the activity you were doing at that time. so to proceed further, please take the telmisartan amlodipine combination i have advice for two weeks and then follow up. wishing you good health. regards"

"hi sir , my uncle is having hepatitis a with jaundice.bilirubin count has been reduced to 4.2 from 9.4.it has been spread to liver , which makes the situation bit frightening .how shall we proceed with the medication ? which hospital offers the best treatment ? i am from india , kerala .",1,48942,"jaundice is not a disease, but rather a symptom or a sign that can occur in many diseases. it refers to the yellowish staining of the skin and the white part of the eyeball, caused by high levels of bilirubin in blood. bilirubin comes from red blood cells (rbc's) - when rbc's get old, they are destroyed, and hemoglobin is released from the destroyed rbc's after the iron it contains is removed - the chemical that remains in the blood after the iron is removed becomes bilirubin. the liver usually removes bilirubin from the blood along with other waste products. jaundice can be of 3 types:? pre-hepatic - increased bilirubin production which the liver in unable to remove from the blood, e.g. patients with hemolytic anemia have an abnormally rapid rate of destruction of their red blood cells that releases large amounts of bilirubin into the blood ? hepatic - defect in the liver prevents bilirubin from being removed from the blood, the most common being viral hepatitis? post-hepatic / obstructive - blockage of bile ducts decrease the flow of bile and bilirubin from the liver into the intestines, which may be due to cancer, gallstones or inflammation of the bile ducts. the treatment of jaundice usually requires a diagnosis of the specific cause of the jaundice and treatment directed at the specific cause. i suggest you contact your doctor for a detailed history and physical examination, which are important for diagnosing the cause of jaundice. bilirubin can also be measured in blood. very high levels of conjugated bilirubin relative to conjugated bilirubin suggest hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells). very high levels of liver enzymes (aspartame amino transferase / ast and alpine amino transferase / alt) suggest inflammation of the liver such as viral hepatitis. high alkaline phosphatase suggests disease or obstruction of the bile ducts. ultrasound examination of the abdomen or other imaging modalities may help to diagnose gallstones, tumors, dilated bile ducts due to obstruction, etc. weakness is a symptom associated with jaundice and takes time to settle down. adílio is the brand name of a medicine called ursodesoxycholic acid that is approved for use in certain specific gall bladder stones and chronic homeostatic liver disease due to gall bladder. limit is an ayurvedic product and i would not like to comment on it."

font have heal pain but do have swelling in the balls of my feet with pain between big toe and the toe next to it the swelling is not severe but the message my brain is getting is severe also feel as my feet are numb but if touched they agent this is 24 hrs a day and has been for several months it has become difficult to walk and keeping my balance is a challenge,1,13930,"hello, and thank you for your question. fortunately, you probably do not have fibromyalgia. there are several possible causes of pain just in the toe. if there is a pinched nerve in the lower spine, it can cause pain that can be just in one toe. if this is the case, you may find that the pain is worse with change in position, such as lying flat or standing up. pain in the toe, typically the big toe, is common in a disorder called gout, in which the body has too much uric acid. the pain usually lasts a few days at a time, and is usually associated with redness and swelling. pain in the toes can be caused by corns or other skin problems that look small but feel very severe. pins and needles, shooting, on-and-off pains can be caused by irritation to a nerve by diabetes, by lack of vitamins such as b12, or by pressure - similar to the ""foot falling asleep"" feeling we sometimes get if we cross our legs too long. fibromyalgia, on the other hand, is usually a ""pain all over"" problem - back pain, neck pain, arm pain, knee pain, without another cause such as arthritis. it usually does not cause just one part of the body to hurt - most patients say that ""everything hurts"". in my practice, i start with finding out as much as i can from the patient about how the pain feels and how long it has been going on, and if it seems related to anything else. then we examine the foot to look for anything going on with the skin, check if the nerves of the foot are normally sensitive, not as sensitive as usual, or more sensitive, and then we may check blood tests to detect diabetes or vitamin deficiency or other problems as needed. fibromyalgia is diagnosed by obtaining a careful history of where the patient is having pain, other medical problems, and completing a physical exam including what is called a ""painful point"" exam where the doctor pushes at certain places in the body - on the back and near the joints - to see if this causes pain. i hope that my answer to your question is helpful. if you have any further questions, please check back with us. i hope your toe is much better soon."

"by 5 year old granddaughter always vomits at any restaurant with the sight of food for the smell of food or as soon as the food arrives to the table . this is very embarrassing because as much as we try to make it to the ladies room , she leaves an embarrassing trail behind . a know this is not normal , but what causes this .",1,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

a have had sex several times this month . be used a condom overtime and a am also on birth control . a try to take my birth control on time but a done always take it at the exact same time . a usually take it in least a half an hour difference than the usual time tho . a am supposed to be on my period currently it was supposed to come yesterday . but today all a have gotten was clear/white spit like consistency fluid . it comes out quite often and a feel like a have my period because of cramps and archie pain . a have also noticed my blood sugar dropping very low through out the day . a have never noticed problems with my blood sugar before . would a be pregnant ?,1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"i a am 25 year old female weighing 165 pkg with strong diabetes history in family . by random sugar came to 129 and fasting sugar came to 118 and on a day , is this diabetes or prediabetes and is this reversible . is it possible to ward of diabetes forever with diet ?",1,70463,"hello have gone through your question and understood your concern. fasting blood sugar (fbs) measures blood glucose after you have not eaten for at least 8 hours. it is the first test done to check for prediabetes and diabetes. if you were not fasting, then the result can not be taken in consideration for the diagnosis of pre-diabetes or diabetes. in my opinion, this result can be considerate like a random blood sugar (rbs) and measures blood glucose regardless of when you last ate. random testing is useful because glucose levels in healthy people do not vary widely throughout the day and blood glucose levels that vary widely may mean a problem. this test is also called a casual blood glucose test. it is true that your age, positive family history and being african american are risc factors for diabetes. but the test result can not be taken in consideration for the diagnosis because it is not fasting. a fasting blood sugar level from 100 to 125 mg/dl is considered prediabetes. if its 126 mg/dl or higher or a random blood sugar level of 200 mg/dl or higher ; on two separate tests, you have diabetes.(actually, if you were fasting, 129 mg/dl can be suggestive of diabetes not prediabetes and the next step will be to repeat the test for the confirmation of the diagnosis)in my opinion you don't have reason to be concerned because the test result is not a fasting but a random measurement, and we can not reach the diagnosis only with this test. so, be patient because the true fasting test will give the exact information about your situation. hope this is helpful. if you have other debts, feel free and ask. best regards."

a am 55 years old and been having pain under my armpit and above my left breast and in the shoulder blade area . a have had yearly memo . and in may an ultrasound of the left breast nothing was found but the pain seems to be getting worse . any suggestions .,1,82366,"hello friend, thank you for posting your query through chat doctor. i am a homeopath answering your query and the answer which i am going to give you may contain several thoughts which may appear strange or new for you. this i say because homeopathy is a new system of medicine and is almost unheard by the majority of the population. therefore, due to the high influence of the conventional medicine the people at large are brainwashed to believe and act according to the health education given by them. coming back to the fibroadenoma of your left breast in the year 1979, you had a psychological conflict in the mind level. you are a sensitive individual and that is why your left breast was affected. it must have been related with your child chat doctor. the sensitivity is genetic, and you reacted to the conflict through the brain according to a genetic programming. mind-brain - organ affection resulted in the development of a lump in your left breast in 1979. you consulted your gynecologist, and he suggested that it may turn to become cancerous in future and so it is better to remove it, and you subdued to his suggestion. actually the lump in the breast was an attempt of the body to cure you, or it was the result of a self defense mechanism. since you had not resolved the conflict in the psychological level, the lump remained there without getting resolved. but the body kept the lump protected in a cyst with minimum amount of inflammation called chronic cystitis. by removing the fibroadenoma or chronic cystic mastitis, you were not cured, but your lump in the breast was removed. in 1995 also you are the same person, you are the same sensitive person, and you underwent another more serious psychological conflict and the same left breast was again affected in a more serious manner. instead of recognizing the mass as a defense mechanism, you got the fear in you that you have cancer. the tissue changes also suggested that there is more serious pathology, and they labelled your lump this time as cancer and suggested removal of your left breast. if you could have recognized the lump as a defense mechanism and if you had no fear of cancer, you could have retained your breast. but the fear of cancer is such that it is associated with death and so you lost your breast. in no case, either by removal of lump in 1979 or by removal of your breast in 1995, you are not cured only your disease is cured. hope by this time you have got the answer for your query. both are related to each other because they are in the same individual, same sensitivity, same program. homeopathy cures the person and once the individual is cured all his diseases will be cured. with best wishes,"

(as you said he has difficulty in walking now). you can also say to his parents that --- they can continue with all religious customs along with medicines, may be then they will agree... with medicine, he will start showing improvement in few days only... it is psychosis and patients will not agree to go to any doctor willingly, so you might need to take him forcefully. this is well accepted as it is for his benefit only. even if he doesn't agree for oral medicine there are injectables which are given to such patients... take the right step, take him to a doctor. hope the reply is useful feel free to ask more questions"

"i pm 15 and pm a girl . a few months ago during a flu that ave got my heart started beating really fast and continued for a day or two . ave been told that its normal . but after that these episodes started coming back for no reason and sometimes a get cramps around the area of my heart for no reason as well . just today my heart started beating fast and hard again and ave checked my blood pressure but its fine . right now pm a bit lightheaded/dizzy and pm starting to worry . a play basketball and practise regularly , but my normal heart rate is a bit high ( 84bpm ) ... is there anything wrong ? should a go to the doc ?",1,88858,"hello and thank you for using chat doctor. i carefully read your question and i understand your concern. i will try to explain you something and give you some advises. as you describe my opinion is that we are dealing with a rhythm issue. someone might feel heart palpitations for different reasons. it may be a simple sinus tachycardia that means that the heart is beating regularly over 100 beats for minute. its normal resting rate is between 60-100 beat for minute. you may experience palpitations because of extra-sistolyc beats. these is electrical impulses generating from parts of the heart different from normal sinus rhythm. this gives the sensation of an escaped, skipping beat. but there are all sow different rhythm problems like atrial fibrillation ore supra ventricular tachycardia where the heart doesn't beat normal, it suddenly beats fast or in a chaotic way with very high frequencies and this might be what we call atrial fibrillation. my opinion is that lifting weight is not the reason of your palpitations. it's quite known in cardiology that during physical exertion the heart rate raises. its maximal frequency should go 220 minus your age, and it should slowly go down. but you describe a long history of palpitations and a sudden heart jumping just for some seconds, immediately chat doctor. so, i think that we should see what are these rhythm fluctuations. does this happen even in a resting situation or only when you exercise? if i was your treating doctor i will recommend a blood analyze, your thyroid hormones, an electrocardiography, echocardiogram and of course a holder monitoring to see your rhythm tendency. ones we have all these we can say what are these palpitations and how to treat them.these is all for a simple check-up to reduce these episodes in the future. whish i was helpful. take good care. best regards"

(as if try to hold urine intermittently during voiding)5. penile squeeze technique applied at the point of ejaculatory inevitability.6. applying a local anesthetic ointment to glans penis prior to penetration.7. leading partner to orgasm by exploring and stimulating other erogenous zones. (other than vaginal containment movements only)8. you can do masturbation before sex (at least 2 hours before). it will make seminal vesicles somewhat empty. so, at the time of sex, semen will take more time to come out. remember that do not evaluate the sexual satisfaction and success only in terms of tic of time, sex strokes, number of thrusts or hours. it is the pleasure (touching and being touched) not the time is the key to healthy sex life. there are medications like paroxetine20 mg or duloxetine 30 mg with sildenafil 50 mg which helps to delay orgasm with improving erectile function. these medicines must be taken under medical supervision. wish you good health."

i woke up and i felt like something was wrong with my heart cut i was feeling a weird sensation in my upper breast bone/ throat so then i got up and felt like i had trapped gas so i tried to burp it out and after a while a huge burp comes out and then i feel better for the time being and then when i get up again the same thing happens . i done know if its just like heartburn because there is no burning sensation or if its something to do with my heart . what should i do !,1,34552,"the only thing for a cold sensation i can think of is acid reflux. when you get heart burn it feels crazy and can give anxiety (hence the rapid heart rate). you can remedy acid reflux (herd, or heart burn, throat burn or whatever you want to call it) by getting some digestive enzymes (try something like source naturals daily digestive enzymes) at a local vitamin store (or try vitacost.com) and till give her enough digestive juices to help grind up her food better. also, food intolerances will cause problems too. i discovered a food intolerance to wheat, milk and peanuts. but you have to write down how you feel after you eat something and try eliminating it for a while and see how it goes. you can ask a doctor for an elisa test (for food allergies) but it doesn't tell us much. a food elimination/rotation diet is much better plus it can't hurt. a sharp knife like feeling is definitely heart burn from what i've felt or heard about. make sure you write down when these things occur, what time and how long (dates) and what she had to eat earlier. pizza is a biggie on heart burn. hot dogs, anything with bad fats in it. bread if she is intolerant to wheat and so on. i would throw in a thyroid (tsh) test for hyper or hypothyroidism. so many symptoms stem from those diseases (difficulty breathing, rapid heart rate, digestion issues and so on)...that it should be warranted just to rule it out. and if it keeps happening see the doc. but sometimes i do believe we have to be our own detectives. my dd has a friend that was ill on and off for a couple of years and saw 11 doctors (hello, aren't they supposed to be intelligent beings?) but no, they couldn't figure out anything. finally, they figured out she has a gluten-allergy."

"i , may a answer your health queries right now ? please type your query here ... hello doc , i am into 34th week of pregnancy ... last ultrasound done at 30th week and it showed baby a head down slightly leftwards .... now i feel baby hiccups rightwards below my navel .... are there any chances that baby is turning back to breech position ... how can it be prevented",1,284,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. if your baby is in the head up position at term, it is not recommended that you deliver vaginally, because there is risk to the baby of birth injury. so if you reach your due date with your baby in the head up position, your obstetrician will likely recommend cesarean section. however, there is a possibility that the baby could turn around on its own. ways to help this to happen is to do what you can to let your belly hang to give the baby a chance to rollover. going on your hands and knees and arching your back high into the air, like an angry cat, for 10 minutes every day, can sometimes help the baby to turn around naturally. however, the best way to help the baby to turn around is for your obstetrician or midwife to perform a procedure called a version. in the us, versions, which literally are done by the doctor pushing the baby into a somersault is performed under ultrasound guidance in a hospital setting. it works about 50% of the time and can give a woman a chance at a normal vaginal delivery. regarding the cord around the babies neck, 15% of normally delivered infants have an umbilical cord around their neck. so the presence of the cord around the neck now does not mean that there will be any problems with labor and delivery if the baby is able to get into the right position. if you are considering having a version, i suggest that you speak to your delivering provider about it soon, as the success rates of version decrease significantly after 37 weeks. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and this information was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy and delivery,"

hi one of my friend was abused when she is 7 yrs old know she got married she is afraid to go to gynaecologist because if something they come to know about her then marriage may break out .. will she be having any cancer like colonial .. or will she having any kind of infections she wants to go for ultrasound what can be found in ultrasound,1,43889,"the best thing you can do for your friend right now is to be really open, honest and frank with her in talking about this issue. she is going to find that everyone around her will do everything they can to avoid talking to her - not out of meanness, but because they simply don't know what to say and feel awful about this fact. people also sometimes feel guilty because they're fine and the other persons not. i would sit down with her during recess or lunch or whatever and just talk to her ... don't be afraid to ask her questions about her illness, how she found out, what her treatment options are, etc. she is probably really wanting to share all her thoughts and fears about this with someone her own age who won't react badly to it - you need to be that person, if you can. offer her a listening ear, a shoulder to cry on if she needs it and a helping hand in any way you can (like making sure if she misses something at school, that you'll help her to pick it up later, etc.). try to be as positive as you can about her prospects, and try to help her to not get really down (which she inevitably will at varying stages of her treatment, which can be really harsh). remember too, many people survive cancer, and she could well be one of them. i will pray for you both - her for surviving her illness and you for maintaining the strength of character to continue supporting her throughout her ordeal. for even thinking about this, you must already be a perfect friend."
hi one of my friend was abused when she is 7 yrs old know she got married she is afraid to go to gynaecologist because if something they come to know about her then marriage may break out .. will she be having any cancer like colonial .. or will she having any kind of infections she wants to go for ultrasound what can be found in ultrasound,2,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."
