"a have felt nauseous , dizzy and faint like , fatigue with stomach pain for the last 36 hours . pm afraid a might have taken too many live for my arthritis pain . also i have a tooth that suddenly started hurting . a have made a dentinal appointment . the tooth is a root canal . also ate some potato salad yesterday that might have been too old . it tasted of but was left over from tabor may dinner",1,44715,"hello, i can understand your concern. it would have been helpful if you had mentioned which tooth was treated for root canal. as you are mentioning that the tooth was black and had cracks in it, i am assuming that the tooth is in the lower front region, and you had had some trauma to the lower jaw area which made the tooth dead and also hurt the chin and lip. other possibility is that if the tooth was dead for many years, it may have developed a periapical cyst in relation with the tooth which might be pressing on the mental nerve supplying lower lip and chin and may cause numbness of those areas. alternatively, the numbness may have started after taking local anesthesia in the lower front area for some tooth problem and the injection might have been given deep. in any case, it seems that the nerve supplying sensation to the lower front area of jaw along with lower lip and chin (mental nerve) is damaged. usually, if the nerve is damaged, it can regenerate in 3-6 months and the sensations can return. if you are not sure regarding the crown on the tooth, you can avoid it for some months and take care not to bite hard things with that tooth so that it does not fracture. you can get the crown after the numbness is solved. i would also advise you to visit an oral and maxillofacial surgeon for the examination of the area and regarding numbness. he/she might take an x-ray to rule out presence of periapical lesion or cyst in relation with the tooth. crown should surely be postponed until this possibility is ruled out. i hope this information helps you. thank you for choosing chat doctor. i wish you feel better soon. best,"

a am a 45 years old woman with no health issues . a do my gynaecological test in every year . just saw little changes in my uterine wall thickness . last year it was 10mm a this year it is 13mm on the 5 the day of my menstruation period . a had one fibroid of 2.8 my of thickness . a have family history of endometrium cancer . is this anything alarming ? to a need any further investigation for this ? thanks and regards .,1,105417,"hallow dear, at the outset, let me assure you that cesarean section has nothing to do with your heavy uncomfortable periods and fibroid. in fact, your heavy painful periods are due to fibroid uterus. had it been only heavy menstruation, thermal ablation would have helped you. thermal ablation is destroying the lining of the uterus (endometrium) by very hot fluid. it is the endometrium of the uterus which gets thrown out as menstrual discharge. hence, once the endometrium is destroyed, there is no menstruation, and no heavy bleeding. however, you have fibroid uterus. this fibroid(s) will remain in the uterine cavity though your menstruation has been stopped by thermal ablation. this fibroid can undergo atrophy after menopause, however, remains as a vulnerable tissue for any type of degeneration including cancer. i would advise you to go for hysterectomy and not thermal ablation. of course, it is advisable to undergo hysteromicroscopically directed biopsy of the endometrium to find out the status of the endometrium before hysterectomy. in about 30% of cases, cancer of endometrium is known to coexist with fibroid since both these conditions are result of high estrogen condition. i hope this helps you."

"hi , i have taken mini is for 1 and half year to stop pregnancy after birth of my first child . i got a miscarried prior to birth of my first child . the cause was thyroid and herpes virus . after taking 6 month ocular the pregnancy was conceived . my periods were irregular by 5 days up each month . after first child we tried for pregnancy . since then one and half year has elapsed . we are facing a grief period . please advise .",1,27194,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. tri-sprintec is a birth control pill that has a traffic regimen; which means that each color pill in the package has a slightly different dose of hormones. occasionally, women who take traffic pills may have some spotting in the first few days after each pill strength changes over the course of the month. this may cause some slight bleeding or spotting when were not supposed to have your period. whenever you had vaginal bleeding, regardless of the cause, usually there is some cramping that accompanies it. furthermore, it is not unusual to have irregular bleeding or spotting in the first 3 months of pill use. both sprinter and tri-sprintec are considered low-dose birth control pills, however there are many brands on the market that have a lower dose of estrogen than the pill you are currently taking. so you may have less irregular bleeding and spotting on a different kind of monophasic (same dose all month) birth control pill. regarding pregnancy, the chance of your conceiving while taking birth control pills and using a condom is basically nonexistent. so i believe the symptoms you were experiencing are side effects due to the new birth control pill. if your desire is for lighter, regular periods, a different brand of monophasic pill may work better for you with fewer side effects. i hope i was able to adequately answer questions today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"hello , for a while now i have been feeling like something is pressing against my ribs from the inside on the left lower side of my chest , when i lie on my front i can to feeling it and when i sit in certain positions also . recently i have been getting shortness of breathe when walking , doctors cant see me for a week but i am really worried .",1,15046,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. feeling short of breath is not unusual while you're pregnant because the hormones of pregnancy actually have a way of telling your brain to breathe faster. this is to ensure that your baby gets enough oxygen, because as your belly gets bigger your lungs are not able to expand as well. so many women feel the sensation of needing to catch their breath all the time when they breathe when they are in the third trimester. in addition, because you would have been on bed rest for so long, you probably are not in very good cardiovascular shape. another possible reason why you could be feeling short of breath is that there is a possibility that you are anemic. normally, as part of routine prenatal care we check your blood count as well is a test for gestational diabetes somewhere between 24 and 28 weeks. if you've not yet had this test, it might be a good idea to mention your symptoms to your doctor. of course, there can be some serious, dangerous things that can cause shortness of breath; like blood clots that spread to your lung, or fluid in the lungs and other pulmonary problems. if you experience any chest pain or severe shortness of breath or start developing a productive cough, you should notify your doctor immediately and possibly go to the hospital for evaluation. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

"by the front of my bottom gum is sore . not the entire gum , though , just a small area below one tooth . it is a little inflamed and redder than the rest of my gum . there a no real pain unless a touch it . a a not sure what is wrong with it . should a just take an aspirin or is it more serious than that ?",1,53390,hi. can understand your concern. as per your complaint the swollen gum and the white material inside it is a result of some inflammation. there can be a few reasons depending upon whether it is the second molar or the wisdom tooth. in case it is a wisdom tooth which is erupting or is impacted then the gum above it can get infected and inflamed due to either food deposition between the gum and the wisdom tooth or it can be due to gum flap bitten by the opposite jaw tooth and the condition is known as peritonitis. the white material in it is pus. in case it is second molar the swollen gum with white material in it can be as a result of infection in the gums due to deposits on the teeth like plaque or calculus or due to foreign body impaction in the gums which carries infection along with it deeper into the gums causing pus formation. it can also be due to deeply infected tooth causing pus formation below the tips of the roots of the tooth causing swelling on the gums with pus inside. i would suggest you to consult a dentist and get evaluated for the exact cause of the swelling and get treated accordingly. in case if it is wisdom tooth either excision of gum flap or extraction if the tooth is impacted followed by antibiotics and painkillers can be done. in case of gum infection professional cleaning of teeth followed by antibiotics and gum paints can help. in case of tooth infection root canal treatment or extraction depending on the condition of the tooth can be done. hope your query is solved. if you find the answer helpful please write a positive review and click on find this answer helpful as a token of appreciation. thanks and regards. chat doctor.

"doctor , i got severe lower abdominal pain after 14 days of my last census period , it had for 2 weeks as sudden pains . but on my period day of this month my chatdoctor test is negative . so i took a urine test . in that report all mentioning oil and + , but rbc is 8-10 ./ of . is it normal range ? but my period came after 2 days later . now i feel some comfortable in the abdomen .",1,73325,"hallow dear, i have gone through your history. i feel there is some confusion in calculating the days of ovulation and fertile period. ovulation takes place 14 days prior to next expected menses. the egg has life of 24 hours while the sperms are active for 72 hours. hence, the fertile period is a period of one week around the days of ovulation. since the ovulation takes place 14 days prior to next menstrual period, your bout of bleeding cannot be 10 days after ovulation and two weeks before expected date of period. this statement suggests that you are having some misunderstanding about ovulation day and fertile period. whether it was an implantation bleeding or it was mittelschmerz (ovulation bleeding) can be decided only on confirmation of the pregnancy. you may take pregnancy test on the overnight first morning urine sample 8-10 days after missed period; done earlier these tests may give false negative results. alternatively you may opt for beta chat doctor test which is very sensitive and can give you reliable results even few days before missing period. since you had considerable bout of bleeding, i would advise you to go for ultrasonography after 10 days of missed period (in case pregnancy test is positive) to assess the safety of the baby. it will inform you whether the bout of bleeding has disturbed the pregnancy or not. this will resolve your dilemma."

( to be specific if a may be hfa ) all my friends are on the spectrum , as i just found out today , and although a exhibit autistic behavioural patterns ( swimming , lack of eye contact , periods of non verbal etc ) and can not socialise a have never been diagnosed . to you think a have done the right thing ? and if possible what do you think my chances are of being diagnosed ?",2,26444,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, i want to reassure you that if you have been taking your birth control pills as directed and you didn't miss any that the chances of your being pregnant are tiny. the failure rate of birth control pills in general is about 1 in 200 per year, meaning one out of 200 women has a chance of getting pregnant on the pill over the course of a year. many women can miss periods for reasons not due to pregnancy. your period can be affected by diet, traveling or changes in your schedule, and especially stress. even worrying about pregnancy can cause enough stress to delay your cycle. also, some women stop menstruating completely when they have been on the pill for a long time, especially low-dose pills like the microgynon you are taking. i suggest you purchase a urine pregnancy test (the over-the-counter ones are just as accurate as a doctor's office) and follow the package directions. if you are not pregnant, you can just wait and see what happens with your cycle and even if you never bleed just start your new pack on time, and you will be protected against pregnancy. if your irregular periods continue to bother you, you may want to see your gun provider who may be able to prescribe a different pill for you that may help you have predictable cycles. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"hi,4 7may a an swear your real the queries right now ? please type your query here ... my father is 47 years old and he is suffering from jaundice which is mild now but he is feeling weakness too much nowadays . which kind of food should i give to him ?",1,60592,"greetings. i appreciate your concern for your father. your father is suffering from the cancer of the bile ducts which is an aggressive cancer. as he is very old, i think biliary stenting should be done to relieve the jaundice followed by some form of oral chemotherapy if he is able to tolerate that.however, if he is in a good health and the cancer is localized then upfront surgery is the option. stenting will be done by gastroenterologist and surgery by a surgeon. hope you now understand well and can choose depending upon the reports and health status of your father, whether to go for surgery or stenting first."
"hi,4 7may a an swear your real the queries right now ? please type your query here ... my father is 47 years old and he is suffering from jaundice which is mild now but he is feeling weakness too much nowadays . which kind of food should i give to him ?",2,106791,"hi, thanks for writing in. it is important to know the type and treatment course of the cancer your father is having. most cancers are evaluated by 5 year survival rate. this is a proportion of people who can survive up to 5 years from the day the cancer is first detected. if your father has survived for more than ten years then he has successfully fought and won the battle with cancer logically. very few people fighting cancer are known to stay alive after 5 years and his doctor has surely given him the right treatment to keep him alive. any ways presently there appears to be a problem with the cancer, and it might have spread to vital organs like brain, lungs and liver. it is difficult to guess the present state of cancer that he is having without additional details. whatever be the situation, the fight with cancer is till the end. your doctor probably wants to spare your father the pain and discomfort of the cancer. it is not that he is giving up but might be that he wants your father to lead a more comfortable life and provide him with more specific treatment options concerning pain relief. please do not worry."

"hello ! i have been having low back pain for quite sometime now , and i think its getting worse . the pain is no longer confined to the back area ( right side ) , but i felt like its radiating to the right abdominal area too . the pain can be described as if the muscles are very fatigued . i have not felt any numbness . a find it difficult to find a comfortable sleeping position . a have a moderate lumbar scoliosis , and i noticed that pain started when i started gaining weight .. please help .",1,73704,"hi diane, the reason for the pain could be a pinched nerve, the one supplying your legs. once a nerve is pinched at its origin from the spinal cord, the symptoms may be felt along its course too. this pinching can be caused due to many reasons and to find the reason you would have to get an mri scan of your lower back or the lumbosacral spine. the frozen shoulder and this pain radiating to knee and foot are not related. provided the mri scan shows the reason for the pain, it can be managed with medications and physiotherapy and in case it doesn't help, you would require a surgery at a later stage."

a think my wisdom tooth is coming in and earlier today it was very swollen and just now a rinsed with hot salt water and i looked at it and picked up the flap gum with tip and pus started coming out so what do a do now ?,1,53390,hi. can understand your concern. as per your complaint the swollen gum and the white material inside it is a result of some inflammation. there can be a few reasons depending upon whether it is the second molar or the wisdom tooth. in case it is a wisdom tooth which is erupting or is impacted then the gum above it can get infected and inflamed due to either food deposition between the gum and the wisdom tooth or it can be due to gum flap bitten by the opposite jaw tooth and the condition is known as peritonitis. the white material in it is pus. in case it is second molar the swollen gum with white material in it can be as a result of infection in the gums due to deposits on the teeth like plaque or calculus or due to foreign body impaction in the gums which carries infection along with it deeper into the gums causing pus formation. it can also be due to deeply infected tooth causing pus formation below the tips of the roots of the tooth causing swelling on the gums with pus inside. i would suggest you to consult a dentist and get evaluated for the exact cause of the swelling and get treated accordingly. in case if it is wisdom tooth either excision of gum flap or extraction if the tooth is impacted followed by antibiotics and painkillers can be done. in case of gum infection professional cleaning of teeth followed by antibiotics and gum paints can help. in case of tooth infection root canal treatment or extraction depending on the condition of the tooth can be done. hope your query is solved. if you find the answer helpful please write a positive review and click on find this answer helpful as a token of appreciation. thanks and regards. chat doctor.

a think my wisdom tooth is coming in and earlier today it was very swollen and just now a rinsed with hot salt water and i looked at it and picked up the flap gum with tip and pus started coming out so what do a do now ?,3,57293,"hi. welcome to chat doctor. as per your complaint it seems that you have inflammation of the gum flap surrounding the wisdom tooth and the condition is known as peritonitis. pericoronitis occurs if food gets lodged between wisdom tooth and the gum flap covering the wisdom tooth... and by food it does not mean that you see big food particles stuffed in there, but it also means uncleaned area and bacterial growth below gum flap... it leads to inflammation of the flap leading to pain swelling and as the area lies close to the throat there can be sore throat and swollen lymph nodes. but pain in the tooth in front of the wisdom tooth can be infection or decay in second molar tooth. the line of treatment is antibiotics, painkillers, mouthwash but only this is not enough to you, you should go to dentist again and ask him to irrigate the area between gum flap and wisdom tooth with saline, betadine solution and hy chat doctor. . other thing is done warm saline gargles, it will help you to reduce inflammation... carry on with the course of your antibiotics and painkillers, your pain and swelling must go in two three days. once you get relieved of your discomfort visit the dentist again and get an iop ar (x-ray) done to find out whether wisdom tooth will erupt to proper occlusion or is impacted (means having an obstruction and won't erupt to occlusion). if it is not impacted just get your gum flap removed known as operculectomy and if impacted get your tooth extracted... this will be your ultimate treatment and finish your problem forever. if the second molar tooth is also decayed leading to pain you can get root canal treatment done to save the tooth and resolve infection. hope you recover soon. thanks and regards."

hello go morning my wife she had black spot on the surface layer of tongue for almost 8 - 9 months treatment done but no cure . when she eat food it pain and that black portion has become little thin as compare to other part of tongue . size of black spot is 1 pm round . please suggest me what to do ?,2,88853,"hello, welcome to chat doctor forum. there are several reasons that can cause black spots on the tongue. practically without inspecting visually it is almost impossible to predict the correct diagnosis. a good picture may also help. but most common black spot on tongue which is of a pea size along with similar spot around it could be suggestive of ""black hairy tongue"". it is simply the elongated growth of the papillae present over the tongue and discolored by food stain and bacterial growth. sometimes the elongation is so much that it looks like a bunch of hair over the tongue, hence its name. it is generally caused by some illness, some medicine intake and mostly due to some local constant irritation. interestingly intake or using mouth wash containing menthol for long time is one of the local factor of developing such condition. which could happen in your case as you were taking altoids (peppermint/menthol) for long time with one side. doctor prescribed iron tablets because iron deficiency is also sometimes blamed for this kind of condition. antibiotics generally does not cause this condition until taken for long time at a stretch. anyway, the condition is self limiting but may take time to regress. continue your iron tablet, stop altoids. maintain your oral hygiene with proper brushing. keep your tongue clean gently using a tongue scraper or using your tooth brush. do not use any commercial mouthwash, warm salt water mouth wash can be used instead. hope your problem will be relieved soon. good luck."

"doc my current husband is that minor and we are planning for a baby . by blood group is o+ . a have a 6 year old son , with my first husband . by query to you is what are the problems that am going to face in pregnancy and will our baby have that ? please help ?",2,3079,"hi, i guess your concern is about getting pregnant, naturally without ivf, at the age of 42 years. you have mentioned that you are taking medicine - m2 tone for regularization of menses. the dose and since when you have started taking the medicine is not shared by you. after taking the medicines whether the menses have become regular or not, it is also not shared by you. it is natures rule, as we get older the functions of our body will be decreased quantitatively and qualitatively. the ovaries also decrease in its function as women become old. the reproductive age group, that is maximum chances of conceiving is more usually at 20 to 40 years. around the age of 50 to 52 years, women stop her menses. this indicates she can't conceive anymore. the age 45-48 years is a transition zone from highly reproductive age group to the age group where menses stop. and here the chances of getting pregnant are not as high as reproductive age group and not low as 50- 52 yrs of age. but still there are a chances of getting pregnant in this transition age, and you are at 42, so there is a hope of getting pregnant. be positive and don't lose hope. however, irregular menses at this age decreases the chances of pregnancy. but, as you are on medicine for irregular menses, once the menses becomes regular, the chances of getting pregnancy increases. so there is double positive hope for you. some people thought they are in reproductive age group, because of problem, either in husband and wife, chances of getting pregnancy decreases. you have told that my and my husband reports are fine. so there is triple positive hope. as you have lost your first child, and you are at the transition zone, it's better to go for an accelerated method of pregnancy. the accelerated methods are-ivf, gift, gift, csi. the advantage of accelerated methods is getting twins of triplets is also there. my suggestions:1. have patience. wait till the menses becomes regular. then pray to god for natural method of getting pregnant.2. at the age of 42, transition zone i would recommend u for accelerated methods - assisted reproductive techniques (art) - ivf, gift, gift, csi and to visit nearby infertility specialist to know pros n cons of each. i pray god to give strength to your family about the loss of first child and bless you with a cute and healthy baby as soon as possible. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"by son has orange and green patches on his tongue ! that is this ? it occurred first when he was about a month old and was treated for thrush which took several months to clear up . now a couple weeks later , the orange and green patches are appearing again . be is 5 months old , about 14 1/2 pounds and 27 inches long .",1,63570,"hello, i can understand your concern. i can think of several possibilities for the orange discoloration of tongue, gums and teeth of your father. firstly, as he is in hospital for 3 months for various diseases, it is understandable that his oral hygiene will be compromised. regular tooth brushing, flossing and gargles would have been neglected for 3 months. this may cause accumulation of food particles, debris, plaque etc. on the teeth, gums and tongue surfaces causing them to appear orange. if his oral hygiene can be improved by use of power toothbrush, mouthwash etc., this problem can be solved. secondly, as he is taking many antibiotics for a chronic period of time, and he is also suffering from fungal pneumonia, there are chances that he is having fungal/yeast growth in mouth causing orange appearance. ask the doctor if fungal pneumonia is being treated with systemic antifungal medications that can cover fungal infection of oral cavity and the growth with stop and disappear. in addition, there are some antibiotics given to treat mrsa, kidney disease and respiratory infections that have side effects of changing the normal bacterial flora of mouth and causing orange discoloration. you can ask your treating doctor about this too. i can assure you that none of these causes are too severe and should not be worried about. i hope this information helps. thank you for choosing chat doctor. let me know if you have follow-up questions. best,"

i took my 6mon old son to his paediatrician because of fever and he is very congested as well as runny nose the paediatrician said that his lungs and nose are clear that hes fine .. but if hes fine what is causing him the fever hes also teething but in aware teething doesn't cause fever,1,54093,"hi. thanks for the query. teething is the phase of development in which the teeth erupt in mouth and during that period the child can have the symptoms of mild discomfort inside the mouth with soreness of gums, swollen gums along with mild rise in temperature. but in case if she has a runny nose and fever then it can be most probably due to viral infection leading to fever. pain in gums can however be due to teething when there is breaking of tooth from the gums leading to inflammation of gums causing pain.-so my suggestion is to continue giving tylenol to relieve pain and along with it, you can also start doing steam inhalation and use a humidifier in your room.-you should also feed her with plenty of fluids and give her soft and bland diet.-give her appropriate rest. hope this helps. regards."

(your bile is not causing this symptom, the fatty liver). so utilize will not help with your fatty liver, at least not so effective as liv 52 ds. at this point, i suggest you keep up with the same medicine that your doctor prescribed, liv-52 ds and you need to make some changes in your diet to help your liver and your body to heal faster.-have plenty of water-eat fresh vegetables and fresh fruits-have a low fat diet-small amount of exercise each day, yoga, walking a few miles-no alcohol at allays with this diet, even your intestine will work better, your kidneys, heart, and your whole body. and you minimize the probability to have gallstones in the future. hope i have answered your query. if you have any other question, feel free to ask me."

hey in 16 and live had the arena put in six weeks after a had my son a year ago . ave had no problems with it at all buy just recently for the past week or so a be been having random sharp pains in the lower left side of my uterus and it like the pains in my lower back pretty much to my butt . could this mean that the arena came out of place ?,1,48791,"hi, thank you for providing the brief history of you. a thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised. as your chief complaint is that when you walk there is a sharp pain in the lateral side of the left foot, i suspect it to be muscular pain or either neuropathic pain for which a thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised. also. when there is a nerve impingement in the lumbar spine, it all starts with the pain in most cases on the lateral side of the foot. as you even mentioned that you had a bony injury in the past, there might be a tendency of abnormal gait during that time and shortening of muscles of the spine due to walking in pain. as i feel, by strengthening the muscles of the core, spine, pelvic floor and lower limbs on both sides you should be able to walk. since the nerve impingement gives the initial symptoms as pain in the lateral side of the foot and progresses over a period of time. so before it gets more on future you can get an mri of lumbar spine and them proceed with physical therapy for the lumbar spine. in my clinical experience i see cases who initially comes with this sort of pain and later with nerve impingement diagnosis. so, from past couple of years i have noticed that this is the first alerting symptom of the neurological pain, so now i deal with first an mri of spine and core stability. results come on 3-4 weeks of time and post which in future complaints are less regards jay in chat doctor."

by daughter has been going through constipation from birth . the is now 3 years old and still gets backed up . be brought her to a gasterolist and she a been on this liquid consumption medicine he told us to 15ml . instead of 5ml cause it was to working . does pedicure back her up also what could a do .,1,33660,"hi there, the backed up stool and tendency to urinary tract infection does point to the idea that she could be constipated, despite being regular. regarding the frequency of bowel movements, do note that different people tend to have different bowel needs, up to 3 times a day is accepted as normal. so she could actually be going daily and still be relatively constipated. what we are aiming for is the right consistency of stools, which is long and sausage-like, with or without cracks. if you need more visual guidance, look for the bristol stool chart online, and aim for type 3 or 4. it is good that she is taking enough fibers, but also pay attention to her habits and stress to her that she needs to go when she feels like it even if it is more than once a day. constipation often occurs at this age because this is when they are getting better at holding it in, and prefer other exciting activities to sitting in the toilet. the other rarer possibility would be that she has a mild form of hirschsprungs disease, which means that some nerves are missing from the end of the colon, making the evacuating of stool difficult. most people have this diagnosed as babies, but if its very mild it can be missed. it might be more likely if she had delayed bowel movement more than a day after birth, or had tendency to constipation even as a baby. you will have to discuss with your doctor on this possibility, because confirmation would be needed with a rectal biopsy. hope this helps, and all the best to you."

key dr. by age is 21 . a a married since two and a half years . last year 11 months before we tried to conceive and got a positive pregnancy test . in that day a was 7 days late for period . in that evening a started to miscarried and end it with a and e. water on after 6 month a again tried but again faced the loss on 5 weeks . help me out,1,10535,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. pregnacare conception is simply a combination of vitamins that help a woman have a healthy pregnancy from conception. it has no hormonal effects and should not have any impact on the regularity of your cycle nor your ability to conceive, it is not unusual for women to bleed on and off for even 6 weeks after a miscarriage so the 19-day bleeding episode you had may not have actually been a menstrual period but still could have been bleeding leftover for your d and c. so you may not be ""late"" at all, but may just have not had a real period since the pregnancy. there is no reason to assume you would have problems getting pregnant again since you have conceived naturally twice in the last year. either way, the pregnancies conception vitamins have nothing to do with your irregular bleeding. it is generally advisable to wait to try to conceive again after your first real period-so i would wait until you bleed again to resume trying to conceive. if you do not get a real period by 3 months from your last bleeding episode, you should follow up for your gun for a re-evaluation of your hormones and treatment with progesterone, which can restart your period cycling. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful. best wishes,"

of so a did an artificial insemination on april 26th my last period was april 8th and my cycles are 33 days like clockwork . in the 9th a went to hospital for back pain a got treat for uni while a was there they gave me a pregnancy test which was positive and told my levels where 129 . by period was due on may 11th . in may 13th a went to the doctors and he tested my levels again and they were 849 the very next day on the 14th a had some spotting around 6pm and went to the of where they tested my levels and they were 1560 and they did a pelvic ultrasound and said they saw the sac a everything looked of . they also treated me for a bacterial infection . a never had any cramps or pain whats so ever . a am no longer spotting . yesterday a went back to doctor which would be may 20th and they did a pelvic ultrasound and said they saw the sac and nothing else which he said he want worried about but he said next friday may 27th we should see something and know if the baby is of or not . be calculated me at 6wks yesterday but that based of a 28 day cycle a think pm only 5wks 4 days . is what a seen on my ultrasound yesterday of ? and how far along am a based off my cycle a the only day a was inseminated ? and what should a see on my ultrasound next week ? the doctor a been seeing is new to me a doesn't take time to listen to me,1,100885,"hallow madam, i hope i can be of help to you today. the due date of delivery (dd) is calculated by a formula dd= last menstrual period date (lmp) + 9 months + 7 days. since you had your lmp on 10 july 2010, the dd would be on 17 april 2011. if dd provided to you is by ultrasonography, a variation of one week is acceptable as ultrasonography calculated dd is by the size of the baby and is calculated from the date of conception. to calculate the date of egg release (ovulation), it happens 14 days before the next expected menses. so considering your menstrual cycle of 30 or 31 days, next menses would be on 10 august and ovulation would be on 28 july 2010. the life of an egg is 24 hours and the sperms are active for 72 hours. hence, a period of one week around the ovulation is fertile period. so your fertile period would be 24 july to 1 august. thus, the conception would be in that period. now in this calculation, you have to make some modifications depending on the periodicity of your menstrual cycle. then you can locate your fertile period of that cycle. thus, the intercourse(s) during this fertile period are likely to cause the pregnancy. if you had a solitary intercourse during fertile period, that day or within 4 days of that day would be the day of conception. of course this all is based on the clinical calculations. if you want to ascertain the paternity of your child for any legal cause, you may go for dna test which would be a foolproof evidence. i hope this helps you."

"i my daughter had a of abdomen that showed that she has mild bilateral pelviectasis and it also shows a subchondrol cyst of the left iliac side of the of point ? the is only 14 years old , she does have mild scoliosis . to a need to be concerned about these results ? ? thank you , marie",1,34445,"hi, thanks for writing in. the collecting system of the kidney is made of renal calyxes and pelvis. this collects the urine formed in kidney and transports it through the ureter (tubes connecting kidneys and urinary bladder) to the urinary bladder. the pelvicalyceal system is the mouth of the kidney where it connects with the upper end of the ureter. i guess that you have got ultrasound scan done, and it shows mild fullness of the pelvicalyceal system in the left kidney, that is a term applied to increase in diameter of the collecting system in your left kidney. it is not a critical situation, and please do not worry if you do not have any urinary symptoms. since it is mentioned as mild fullness and no kidney stones have been found, therefore(i) it can be that your bladder was completely full at the of ultrasound scan(ii) your kidney pelvicalyceal system is appearing full by itself (extrarenal pelvis) and is an extension of normal appearance.(iii) rarely an infection of urinary system and kidneys (recent or old) can cause such a finding, but this is likely only if you have symptoms like pain in the region of kidney and problems like burning urination or discoloration of urine or any kidney infections in the past.(iv) stones in kidney or ureter can also cause fullness of pelvicalyceal system and since you do not have any stone therefore this does not apply to you. it is important to know if your scan was repeated after passing urine and still there was persistent mild fullness of the pelvicalyceal system on left side. this can also be confirmed by doing an mvp which is injecting a contrast and taking 5 to 6 x-rays to study the functioning of the kidneys in a better way. please consult the urologist."

(i would not recommend this activity in case of brain aneurysm, because the devastating consequences of possible intracranial hemorrhage). i recommend monitoring closely your blood pressure, before and after this activity and treat possible high blood pressure. hope to have been of help! greetings!"

i doc heres the deal pm 17 years old but by sperm is still really clear ( not white at all ) but a know its not pre-cum a am kind of a late bloomer ( absolutely no acne and less than normal facial hair ) so i was wondering is it normal for me not to have white sperm or do i have a serious problem like impotence ?,1,37527,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. even though your boyfriends penis was inside you for only a short time, sperm can be present in pre-ejaculate (or pre-cum) and if you truly do not want to become pregnant it is really important to avoid any contact of the penis with your vagina during sexual play. the most fertile time of a woman cycle is in the middle, typically 14 days before your menstrual period would be due. so the time from when your period finishes until you start to feel pms symptoms is your fertile time. so in this case, since your boyfriend did not ejaculate, it still would be quite rare for you to have conceived. the most common sign of pregnancy is a late or delayed menstrual period. so in your case, you just need to wait for your period to arrive, and if it is late, you can do an over-the-counter urine pregnancy test which is greater than 99% accurate. pregnancy test do not become positive however until at least 2 to 3 weeks after conception. so in summary, your chances of having gotten pregnant in your particular situation is very, very low. for the future, please make sure that the penis is completely covered with a condom if it has any contact with the opening of your vagina. as long as the area is moist, sperm can swim all the way up your vagina from the opening and result in pregnancy. however, the amount of sperm in pre-cum is extremely low, so again i doubt that you need to be concerned about this one sexual encounter. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was helpful. best wishes,"

(mold is a very common allergen) does it contain fumes of acids/cleaners, etc’d. how are his asthma symptoms in between? does he have breathing difficulty, cough or wheezing?e. are there any seasonal variations?f. does he have any other medical conditions? does he take any other medications regularly/frequently?g. does he have nose symptoms? - nose congestion, sneezing, running nose, etc.?h. does he have any digestive problems? constipation, acidity, heart burn, etc.?i. does he smoke? any other exposure to dusts, smokes or air pollution?j. is stresses an important factor in his life? does stress worsen his symptoms? above details would help me to know more about his health and therefore to make more specific suggestions for him. at present, from your provided information, i would like to make more specific suggestions for him as follows:1. i would suggest him spirometry with post-bronchodilator reversibility testing. this will help to know his lung capacity, status of his asthma as well as it will also help to better choose his medications.2. i would also suggest him allergy testing for common allergens. in addition, i would also suggest him serum total ige and baseline serum treatise levels. (serum treatise levels are done only at a few centers in india at present)3. if such further episode occurs, i would also suggest you to get him examined by a doctor as soon as possible, get his blood sugar and blood pressure measured. 4. as he has severe asthma, i usually suggest my such patients regular use of inhalers like inhaled corticosteroids. for in-between asthma symptoms, i would suggest him to use albuterol inhaler on as-and-when-needed basis. further medications can be suggested only after detailed information.5. in general, i would suggest him plenty of fluids during day to maintain hy chat doctor. i would also suggest him to not immediately stand up after awakening in the morning. he should sit upright in the bed for a few minutes and then slowly stand up and go to washroom. this may help if he has postural hypotension. hope above suggestions will be helpful to you. should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at chat doctor. wish your son the best of the health ahead. thank you & regards."

hi i actually have regular chest pain and have been attending hospital for a while they have told me i have water in my lungs and swelling on my feet . i also feel as if there is something wrong with my kidneys . when i have chest pain i actually cant breath properly and my skin goes paler . please could a give me some advice,1,15046,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. feeling short of breath is not unusual while you're pregnant because the hormones of pregnancy actually have a way of telling your brain to breathe faster. this is to ensure that your baby gets enough oxygen, because as your belly gets bigger your lungs are not able to expand as well. so many women feel the sensation of needing to catch their breath all the time when they breathe when they are in the third trimester. in addition, because you would have been on bed rest for so long, you probably are not in very good cardiovascular shape. another possible reason why you could be feeling short of breath is that there is a possibility that you are anemic. normally, as part of routine prenatal care we check your blood count as well is a test for gestational diabetes somewhere between 24 and 28 weeks. if you've not yet had this test, it might be a good idea to mention your symptoms to your doctor. of course, there can be some serious, dangerous things that can cause shortness of breath; like blood clots that spread to your lung, or fluid in the lungs and other pulmonary problems. if you experience any chest pain or severe shortness of breath or start developing a productive cough, you should notify your doctor immediately and possibly go to the hospital for evaluation. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

"i , a have a daughter of age 6 plus , she has developed a wrong habit of scratching or rubbing the ass aggressively to the edge of hard surface . we have been hearing complaints from school and others regarding this since last 2-3 years are helpless to understand this problem , can you help me to diagnose this case",1,15522,"hello, welcome to chat doctor. thanks for posting your question at this forum. we understand your concern. i am chat doctor psychiatry from india. i will guide you about your daughters' health. whatever information you have given here about your daughter, point towards a serious long-lasting mental illness of psychosis like schizophrenia. i must explain you in simpler way. schizophrenia is a psychotic illness in which the person has abnormal perception, absurd thinking, decline of higher mental function, deterioration in social and occupational functioning and significant personal sufferings for years. the patient may claim to hear unusual voices which others deny hearing. this is called auditory hallucination. initially the voices come for a short period and the person feels strange and does not understand what to do. he/ she gradually may start believing on those voices as frequency and intensity of voices increases with passage of time. often these voices comment/discuss derogatory about the person and sometimes these may suggest or command the person to do certain act. sometimes the person may harm herself/ himself sunder the influence of these voices. as you have experienced, she has a self-talking behavior since last many years, has harmed herself once and now she is claiming a clear two-way conversation with that voice. it appears that she is having auditory hallucination(auditory hallucination is one of the commonest symptoms in psychosis like schizophrenia), and apparently these voices are unpleasant or commanding in nature that might have provoked the episode of self harm in the past. since the onset of symptoms is in childhood and has been continuing for years it shows poor awareness of caregiver about the symptoms of illness. it is never too late. you must consult a good child and adolescent psychiatrist and encourage your daughter to discuss her symptoms honestly so that the diagnosis can be finalized. if i had been her doctor, i would have advice her for brain imaging, certain other investigations, to take some antipsychotic medicines under supervision of a family member and to attend psycho-educative classes regularly. medicines and supportive therapy can bring remission to illness. hope this has helped you. i wish you all the best."

"54 year old woman , first experienced a tingling feeling or electric shock feeling or a feeling as if a had been hit by a shot rubber band , followed by numbness in that spot 12 years ago while pregnant . occurs in both thighs off and on - it went away for quite a while after pregnancy and then was back earlier this year and now is gone again",1,17608,"hi, this feeling of tingling and numbness along both thighs is due to pressure on a nerve near the pelvic bone close to the lower abdomen. this nerve runs down the front of the thigh. one gets a feeling of tingling and numbness on and off. this is known to start off in pregnancy when there is stretch of the abdomen wall and also of the pelvic ligaments which in turn stretches this nerve. you need to avoid wearing tight clothes, underclothes which can press upon the lower waist. if its disturbing then your doctor can prescribe certain medication effective for nerve pains. a local steroid injection is sometimes used if the condition is too troublesome. take care. hope i have answered your question. let me know if i can assist you further."

"by 9 year old has a fever of 102 , is complaining of extremely achy legs , arms , head , and says the skin on her back is tender and hurts . the says her tummy is upset , but does not want to eat crackers or anything . the says she is very cold , but her skin is quite hot .",2,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

a have had a gastric band for about 4 years and and for the last few weeks a have been having a stitch like pain in my upper left side around my rib cage whicchatdoctores and goes . a am not sure if it is related to the band or not but can become quite uncomfortable .,1,10540,"hi and welcome to chat doctor. i understand how it can be very challenging to pursue running with so much pain. the pain you have is due to a condition called, iliotibial band syn chat doctor. it occurs when the iliotibial band, the ligament that runs down the outside of the thigh from the hip to the shin, is tight or inflamed. the it band attaches to the knee and helps stabilize and move the joint. when the it band isn't working properly, movement of the knee (and, therefore, running) becomes painful. it band pain can be severe enough to completely sideline a runner for weeks, or even longer. here is a list of dos and don'ts that will surely help you! dos:1. the best way to get rid of it for good is to rest immediately. that means fewer miles, or no running at all. in the majority of runners, resting immediately will prevent pain from returning. if you don't give yourself a break from running, its can become chronic.2. while you're backing off on your mileage, you can cross-train. swimming, pool running, cycling, and rowing are all fine. stair-climbing is not, because it is too much like running3. when running on a track, change directions repeatedly and always do icing for minimum of 10 min to help reduce inflammation. 4. make sure your shoes aren't worn along the outside of the sole. if they are, replace them.5. walk a quarter- to half-mile before you start your runs. 6. see a physical therapist near you and get a few sessions of ultrasonic therapy. dots :1. don't run on concrete surfaces. i hope this information is helpful to you. take care and have a nice day :)"

(would you be having it then?) now your cycle is of 30 days period. so the expected date of ovulation should be 07 january. hence, if the conception takes place on 07 january, the due date of delivery would be 30 september. the hitch here is that you should have ovulation taking lace on 07 january. moreover, we have noticed that all the pregnancies do not last for 280 days. the delivery can take place any time between 3 weeks earlier to 1 week later than the expected due date of delivery. keeping these facts and calculations in mind, you may plan your sexual relations accordingly. i hope this will help you."

i a have been having back pain for a year now that is at times pretty severe . a had an mri and it said that a have disk bulges at s1/l5 & l3/l4 . it also said a have a bone spur at l3/34 . a have had steroid injections and they relieve the paid for about a week and it comes back . a am now seeing a physical therapist that a have been going to for about 6 weeks and have shown a small improvement . that surgical options do a have as a am tired of hurting as my life style has changed and a want to be back to my old active self . thank you,1,80909,"hi, i went through your history and have identified the following problems; i have not seen your x-rays or mri films, so my opinion of this is going to be a limited one.1. the t7 compression fracture: this fracture must have been a stable fracture, as you have been weight-bearing and walking even after the fall. an unstable fracture would have contributed to new neurological deficits that you would have experienced and not allowed you to bear weight at all. and since it's been more than 3 months since the injury, the fracture would have healed by now anyway. since it takes an average of 6 weeks for vertebral body fractures to heal.2. the disc bulge if severe enough at l4-5 can contribute to numbness over the back of your calf. this would signify a neurological compression. if it was a bad disc bulge or disc prolapse as we call it you would most likely need a surgical intervention. so in conclusion, you wouldn't have messed your back more by this. but i suggest you show a spine surgeon who could take a look at your problems, examine you clinically and correlate with your mri images and decide whether you need any surgical intervention or not."

"by 2 or old has a cooked spaghetti noodles stuck in her throat . a believe she partially snorted it from her throat up by she is pulling at her nose too . the can breathe , eat and drink . when a look at her throat with a flashlight a see the noodle hanging vertical . a had cut the noodles so its not too long .",1,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"hello . by gum where a believe my wisdom tooth should be ( a am still a teenager and it has not sprouted so to speak ) is swollen and irritated only on the left side , lower jaw . it hurts to swallow ( dysphagia like symptoms ) with anything food , water , saliva , my glands feel swollen , a can barely talk without it hurting me . a had a 100.5 fever at the doctors office the other day and the doctor did nothing for me . a tried to self diagnose my self and a came to the conclusion of pericoronitis but a do not know what to do now",1,57293,"hi. welcome to chat doctor. as per your complaint it seems that you have inflammation of the gum flap surrounding the wisdom tooth and the condition is known as peritonitis. pericoronitis occurs if food gets lodged between wisdom tooth and the gum flap covering the wisdom tooth... and by food it does not mean that you see big food particles stuffed in there, but it also means uncleaned area and bacterial growth below gum flap... it leads to inflammation of the flap leading to pain swelling and as the area lies close to the throat there can be sore throat and swollen lymph nodes. but pain in the tooth in front of the wisdom tooth can be infection or decay in second molar tooth. the line of treatment is antibiotics, painkillers, mouthwash but only this is not enough to you, you should go to dentist again and ask him to irrigate the area between gum flap and wisdom tooth with saline, betadine solution and hy chat doctor. . other thing is done warm saline gargles, it will help you to reduce inflammation... carry on with the course of your antibiotics and painkillers, your pain and swelling must go in two three days. once you get relieved of your discomfort visit the dentist again and get an iop ar (x-ray) done to find out whether wisdom tooth will erupt to proper occlusion or is impacted (means having an obstruction and won't erupt to occlusion). if it is not impacted just get your gum flap removed known as operculectomy and if impacted get your tooth extracted... this will be your ultimate treatment and finish your problem forever. if the second molar tooth is also decayed leading to pain you can get root canal treatment done to save the tooth and resolve infection. hope you recover soon. thanks and regards."

"severe food poisoning , 6th day now am able to take in small amounts of plan foods . but now after eating within couple hour i feel a lump in my throat ... i have to drink plant of water because it feels like there still something stuck in my throat , i believe i have an infection in my throat . pm i able to take antibiotics now ?",1,77258,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the sensation of feeling something stuck in your throat is a symptom of reflux-when the food that you eat or the acid in your stomach can back up and irritate it. this is common when you have a large belly at full term because your stomach is being pushed up towards your chest and also the hormones from the pregnancy cause the top opening of your stomach that connects to your esophagus to be looser, so food and acid can leak more easily. the best way to try to control this is to eat only small amounts at one time and to make sure you sit up for at least 2 hours after meals. taking antacids, which for the most part are all safe during pregnancy, can also help. trying to cough up what you feel in your throat will not help because there is not actually something solid coming up. these symptoms may be difficult to treat, but the good news is the symptoms will get better after you have the baby. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

by very lower back is hurting . a do have hip problems .. could it be from that . a do not have any symptoms of kidney infection except for the lower back pain . a was diagnosed about 7 years ago with the start of stenosis of the spine . is this what is happening ?,1,48154,"hi, thanks for writing in. the nerves of the lower back, calf and foot originate in the spine. the nerves arise from nerve roots which then combine in different permutations and then form a nerve that transmits nerve impulses. since your nerve conduction studies have shown that the tingling is coming from the spine, it is possible that there are problems involving discs in the lower back at single or multiple levels and this disc displacement is causing pressure over the nerve roots. when a particular nerve supplying an area like calf and foot is compressed at the roots, then the patient experiences tingling and pain which appears to be involving the areas supplied by that nerve. this is what is happening to you. it will help to get an mri scan of lower back and then discuss the areas of possible nerve root compression with your doctor. physical therapy helps in most patients with mild tingling and pain. some patients also require nerve pain relievers for treatment. during sitting or sleeping the nerve roots are not irritated, and therefore you do not feel the symptoms. you can go for colonoscopy which is due in 3 days. please do not worry."

hello a have been experiencing very bad pain in my back and front kidney area and when a made a bowel movement there was blood and some bits of fleshy looking chunks a was wondering what this might be . a have had a swollen prostate but it want bad the last time a had it checked 3 months ago could it be connected thank you .,1,44715,"hello, i can understand your concern. it would have been helpful if you had mentioned which tooth was treated for root canal. as you are mentioning that the tooth was black and had cracks in it, i am assuming that the tooth is in the lower front region, and you had had some trauma to the lower jaw area which made the tooth dead and also hurt the chin and lip. other possibility is that if the tooth was dead for many years, it may have developed a periapical cyst in relation with the tooth which might be pressing on the mental nerve supplying lower lip and chin and may cause numbness of those areas. alternatively, the numbness may have started after taking local anesthesia in the lower front area for some tooth problem and the injection might have been given deep. in any case, it seems that the nerve supplying sensation to the lower front area of jaw along with lower lip and chin (mental nerve) is damaged. usually, if the nerve is damaged, it can regenerate in 3-6 months and the sensations can return. if you are not sure regarding the crown on the tooth, you can avoid it for some months and take care not to bite hard things with that tooth so that it does not fracture. you can get the crown after the numbness is solved. i would also advise you to visit an oral and maxillofacial surgeon for the examination of the area and regarding numbness. he/she might take an x-ray to rule out presence of periapical lesion or cyst in relation with the tooth. crown should surely be postponed until this possibility is ruled out. i hope this information helps you. thank you for choosing chat doctor. i wish you feel better soon. best,"

by mother recently had a mini stroke . to loss to any movement with her limbs . her memory is not as sharp as it was prior to stroke . the is very tired and talks less . in time will she return to being more involved with conversations and less short answers . is there any special care she should be receiving ? thanks,1,105496,"his am chat doctor. i have read your message. i think i can help you. first, i do not think that your prior stroke is involved. what you have described is a type of aphasia neurologically speaking. and aphasia is usually caused by a left sided brain problem-not right like you state in your query. second, if it was truly due to the stroke, the problem would have been since 2009. brain problems in stroke don't get delayed. so, i don't think that your prior stroke has anything to do with the issue. second, the main causes of aphasia are stroke and dementia. it is not a stroke as per prior ct scan, and not dementia-dementia is memory loss, and from the query, your memory is pretty good-you remember the year 2009 clearly (suggests long term memory is good), and you remember the medicines (suggests short term memory is good as well). so like your doctors, i don't think its dementia either. however, i disagree with the choice of investigations- the ct has clearly missed your pre-existing stroke as well. so i cannot be sure whether it has missed a newer stroke as well. so, i would have ideally suggested another mri brain (a more sensitive study than cat scan) and a cv doppler. however, i still don't think it is a stroke. a stroke starts suddenly. and you have definitely not said that there was a sudden onset of symptoms. if however you have forgotten to mention this in the query, you should definitely think about stroke and plan an mri and cv doppler as suggested before. third, a significant history that you have given is the loss of work and lack of hobbies and physical exercises. i won't call it depression or anxiety. and therefore i don't think your medicines will work either. in your case, the age-old adage-all work and no play makes jack a dull boy-is probably most appropriate. so my suggestion is that you need to stop smoking and get some company and daily activities. it may sound odd to you, but inactivity does take its toll. i don't think medicines are needed in your case. you just need to fill in your time with more activities so that your mind is active again. i have tried to make it as simple as possible for you to understand. feel free to ask another query with a specific doubt based on the information i have given you. i would be happy to help you further. best of luck,"

hello ! ! a am a 36 year old female and slightly overweight . a have been walking an hour a day since a year . by problem is that recently a have been experiencing heaviness in the chest ( both sides ) soon after a start walking and the pain gradually decreases in 30 minutes or so . why does this happen ? is there any problem with my heart ?,1,93607,"hi! yes, it is possible that a normal ecg is followed by an abnormal stress test. the ecg done when the person is at rest, does not always show the problem of coronary heart disease. this is because while resting, the heart gets the amount of blood and oxygen that it needs to work. that is why, when there has been a typical chest pain and the ecg at rest was normal, the doctor recommends a stress test-ecg. during this stress, the heart job increases and the amount of blood and oxygen that it needs are doubled. in a healthy person, the heart work and the amount of blood and oxygen that it needs are in balance, while in coronary heart disease they are disbalance (stress test shows abnormalities). i tried to explain why it can happen to have a normal ecg and an abnormal stress test-ecg. i hope to have been clear enough for you. i wish your father gets better soon! thanks for sharing your concern with us! all the best,"
hello ! ! a am a 36 year old female and slightly overweight . a have been walking an hour a day since a year . by problem is that recently a have been experiencing heaviness in the chest ( both sides ) soon after a start walking and the pain gradually decreases in 30 minutes or so . why does this happen ? is there any problem with my heart ?,2,5481,"hi there, im sorry to hear about the medical problems your father is having. when i hear the symptoms that your father is having, the first thing that comes to my mind is claudication. claudication is pain while walking due to arterial insufficiency- basically, the muscles in the legs don't get enough blood flow when they are being used, and they start to ache. this is caused by peripheral vascular disease and is common in smokers, diabetics, and patients with high cholesterol levels. these patients will often have a history of coronary artery disease and sometimes renal problems as well. the first thing i would recommend is for your father to start a waking regiment and walk consistently every day. he should aim to walk for about 30 minutes a day. if he cants do 30 minutes, he should do as much as he can, and then try to do a little more each day. the most important thing is daily consistency - he has to do it every day, not just one or two times a week. i'd also recommend he check his cholesterol levels, and if they are high a statin such as lipitor (atorvastatin) can help lower his levels and prevent further damage. finally, if he continues to have problems with walking after 6 months of a dedicated walking problem, then he should see a vascular surgeon and have his arterial vessels looked at in his leg with ultrasound. i hope this is helpful. please contact me with any questions."

i want to get pregnant i am 36 yrs old an i have stopped the repro shot in feb this year but i have not seen ant signs of ovulation . although my last period was at beginning of april and only light and went for bout 10 days i normally go for bout 3 to 4 and have not had period since,1,73325,"hallow dear, i have gone through your history. i feel there is some confusion in calculating the days of ovulation and fertile period. ovulation takes place 14 days prior to next expected menses. the egg has life of 24 hours while the sperms are active for 72 hours. hence, the fertile period is a period of one week around the days of ovulation. since the ovulation takes place 14 days prior to next menstrual period, your bout of bleeding cannot be 10 days after ovulation and two weeks before expected date of period. this statement suggests that you are having some misunderstanding about ovulation day and fertile period. whether it was an implantation bleeding or it was mittelschmerz (ovulation bleeding) can be decided only on confirmation of the pregnancy. you may take pregnancy test on the overnight first morning urine sample 8-10 days after missed period; done earlier these tests may give false negative results. alternatively you may opt for beta chat doctor test which is very sensitive and can give you reliable results even few days before missing period. since you had considerable bout of bleeding, i would advise you to go for ultrasonography after 10 days of missed period (in case pregnancy test is positive) to assess the safety of the baby. it will inform you whether the bout of bleeding has disturbed the pregnancy or not. this will resolve your dilemma."

"a am 19 years old . a was diagnosed with pcos about a year ago . a was told over a 7 month period that a was not taking birth control that a had developed 11 cysts . it causes me pain in my right side , where most originate , but a have also been experiencing pain in my stomach , extreme nausea , and back pain . by doctor told me these could all be symptoms associated with the birth control they have me on . it has been ongoing since a started my new birth control ( i switched three months ago because of these symptoms ) and they were supposed to be alleviated but it has continued . any help ?",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

yes i recently moved to a very humid region and have developed small itchy bumps on my forearms what could this be ? this happened exactly a year ago when i lived in korea and now i live in japan how can this be treated or prevented . a have no known allergies and believe this is weather related . pm currently using tea tree oil .,1,60956,"hello melissa, it is quite difficult to understand what exactly you are suffering from and how to relate this to seasonal allergies. in allergic reactions that involve the eye, one gets red itchy sore eyes known as conjunctivitis. there can be some swelling around the eye; and along with runny nose, itchy nose. the tight feeling that you get - is it because it is red and inflamed, and you are unable to open it; or because it is swollen? if you do get headaches, in front of the head, then all this could be related to allergic rhinosinusitis. if you think all these are plausible, then blood tests (specific ige) against dust mites, tree and grass pollen, animal dander should be done to see if this is the case. if allergies are proven, long acting antihistamines such as cetirizine or loratadine 10 mg tablets taken once daily (maximum three times a day) should suffice. hope this helps. best wishes."
