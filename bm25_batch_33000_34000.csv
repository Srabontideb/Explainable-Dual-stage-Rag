(this is not a common scenario when compared to encountering an antibiotic resistance). so next spike of fever, kindly take your son to er, and it is better to get him admitted in the hospital, do blood and urine test and cultures and treat accordingly after ruling out other infectionsregards"

i a have very sore gums a sore throat and very sensitive teeth and my tongue is red with a few small spots on its tip ? been going on for a few days now and doctor told me it was a virus and to get a blood test by my up but not to take anti biotic which a thought was wrong ?,1,39059,"hello! i have been through your question. related your concern you should know that if you have persistent throat pain, your body could be trying to tell you that something is wrong. many common colds and viruses can cause a sore throat, which typically resolves within a few days. but when a sore throat persists, and you can't find relief and after two antibiotics treatment as you have, it's something to be taken seriously. some possible causes of a chronic sore throat include infection of the tonsils, strep throat, allergies, mononucleosis, inhaling air pollutants, smoking ore inhaling through the mouth instead of the nose. to successfully treat a sore throat, you have to know what is causing it. what i suggest for you is doing a physical examination by an ent doctor to see in detail the local situation of your throat and ears, full blood count and throat culture test to do a differential diagnosis between some the most probably of above-mentioned causes (non-treated well tonsillitis or strep throat, mononucleosis and allergies). i hope my answer help you. i wish a quick recovery."

hellomy husband and a have been trying for a baby for 3 . months now but it hast happened .. be also have been taking prenatal medication .. is there a problem ? a am 28 and he is 32 ? also to find out he has phimosis ? does that affect conceiving ? ! pm worried ? thank a,1,43820,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, i want to reassure you that no matter what your endometrial measurement may be, 80% of couples will conceive within one year naturally. couples are not diagnosed as infertile until you have been trying and been unable to become pregnant for over one year. endometrial thickness is really only relevant in the context of couples trying to get pregnant through in vitro fertilization. the thickness of your uterine lining is somewhat related to your estrogen levels. when couples are undergoing ivf, treating with additional estrogen can thicken the uterine lining. however, because you've been only trying to get pregnant for four months, your endometrial lining may have absolutely nothing to do with the reason why you have not yet conceived. furthermore, unless your husbands' sperm count has been shown to be decreased, magazine should not have any effect on fertility nor should affect any health of a developing baby should you conceive. medications taken during pregnancy by the mother can affect the fetus, but not any medication taken by the father, because medication cannot be transmitted before fertilization through sperm. so unless the medication causes the sperm count to be low or abnormal, there is no medical reason why your husband needs to be off his medication for colitis in order for you and need to conceive successfully. i suggest that if he needs the medication for his health that he continue to take it. as for is maximizing your chance of healthy pregnancy, the best thing you can do is get plenty of sleep, eat a well-balanced diet, take prenatal vitamins, and tried to have regular(at least 2 to 3 days a week) unprotected intercourse from the time your menstrual period finishes until you begin to feel premenstrual symptoms. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and i wish you and your husband the best of luck in conceiving. best wishes,"

my heart stops for a second or two then beats fast to catch up . it happens more at night and when in laying on my side . is this anything to be concern about . a have a second question a recently had all of my colon remove except for the stump a pass mucus out of my rectum some times it is mix with blood should a go see my doctor,1,35752,"hello and thank you for using chat doctor. i carefully read your question and i understand your concern. i will give you my opinion about this. you explain about fast, racing heart beats and feeling dizzy, light head. my opinion as a cardiologist is that these symptoms are related with some heart rhythm issues. it might be possible that the doctors do not find anything, because you are under normal rhythm when you meat the doctors. this rhythm problem might be different. the most important one is atrial fibrillation. this is an arrhythmia when the heart runs in a chaotic way. this is why you might feel your heart running fast. also, it doesn't wok properly, it doesn't feel normally and for this reason the person might experience dizziness, lightheaded. this rhythm issue might happen once a wile, it comes and go, and so it is difficult to catch it. so, my opinion is that you should do some examinations, where the most important one is holder rhythm monitoring for 48 h. taking the monitor for 48 h rises the possibility to catch the rhythm problem if it is any. i don't know if you already did it, but you may repeat it again to rise the possibility to catch something. also, i will recommend a cardiac echo, a blood analyze to exclude anemia or thyroid gland problems that cause this kind of problems sometimes. if all these examinations result normal, than you should not worry. only after this we might say that every thing is alright, its just stress. hope i was helpful. wish you good health. best regards."

hello a injured my calf muscle two weeks ago . a was on crutches for two weeks and just started walking on it monday . a feel limited pain walking and can flex the muscle . by concern though is when the muscle is flexed a have a good sized indent on the medial side .,1,91109,". i read your question carefully, and i understand your concern. from the information you gave, the first thing i suspect is muscle strain. the suspicion for this condition is even higher after you have done examination, even a ct scan. regarding the amoxicillin therapy, it is an antibiotic and i can't find a reason for taking that, but for sure the doctor that prescribed it had a reason for that. i do have some questions though. is the pain localized in you abdomen or between the lower ribs in your right side. the pain is steady, or it begins or worsens with movement? do you have any swelling or bruising? is it tender when you touch it? if it is more localized between your ribs, it gets worse with movements or sneezing or deep breathing, it might be tender when you touch it than probably it is just muscle strain (as i said you excluded major conditions with examination. besides this, the condition how it started (stretching too much to get something) and an acute onset, all lead to muscle strain. in general, muscle sprain can be treated with rice therapy - rest, ice application, compress and exercise. to alleviate the pain you could take pain medication like ibuprofen or naproxen. it is necessary to limit the movement of the torso (rest, but just the firs days). gentle stretching exercises can help strengthen the muscles. pain can be alleviated applying an ice pack for 15-20 minutes 2-3 times a day (ice should not be in direct contact with the skin). for a full recovery it can take 4-6 weeks. feel free for additional questions. i hope the answer helped you. best regards"

to a had sex for the first time a week ago an i noticed a bled for a week and now it stopped and now in feeling hungary all the time my of used a condom but in worried this might be something serious would i have to start taking birth control and did i already have my period when i bled cause in suppose to get it around now,1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

his .. i have been married for 2 yrs now . i was diagnosed with a laparoscopic surgery in sept 2011 below the h.s.g report was not clear . in the surgery some perish . adhesion were removed . now i have been trying for a baby from 5 months with sphere and fish on the 5th day . our reports are absolutely clear . when will conceive ?,1,43820,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, i want to reassure you that no matter what your endometrial measurement may be, 80% of couples will conceive within one year naturally. couples are not diagnosed as infertile until you have been trying and been unable to become pregnant for over one year. endometrial thickness is really only relevant in the context of couples trying to get pregnant through in vitro fertilization. the thickness of your uterine lining is somewhat related to your estrogen levels. when couples are undergoing ivf, treating with additional estrogen can thicken the uterine lining. however, because you've been only trying to get pregnant for four months, your endometrial lining may have absolutely nothing to do with the reason why you have not yet conceived. furthermore, unless your husbands' sperm count has been shown to be decreased, magazine should not have any effect on fertility nor should affect any health of a developing baby should you conceive. medications taken during pregnancy by the mother can affect the fetus, but not any medication taken by the father, because medication cannot be transmitted before fertilization through sperm. so unless the medication causes the sperm count to be low or abnormal, there is no medical reason why your husband needs to be off his medication for colitis in order for you and need to conceive successfully. i suggest that if he needs the medication for his health that he continue to take it. as for is maximizing your chance of healthy pregnancy, the best thing you can do is get plenty of sleep, eat a well-balanced diet, take prenatal vitamins, and tried to have regular(at least 2 to 3 days a week) unprotected intercourse from the time your menstrual period finishes until you begin to feel premenstrual symptoms. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and i wish you and your husband the best of luck in conceiving. best wishes,"

"i or , by baby just 3weeks+ and a feed her with breast milk once or twice per day and lactose when ever she is hungry but whenever she want to past motion sometimes she will cry , sometimes without any action . why this thing happen ? that is the best way to feed her ? els advice.thanks in advance",1,25552,"welcome to the chatdoctori understand your concerns. if you're breastfeeding, green poo can be a sign that your baby is taking in too much lactose (the natural sugar found in milk). this can happen if she often feeds, but doesn't get the rich milk at the end of the feed to fill her up. also, it leads to poor weight gain. make sure your baby finishes feeding from one breast before you offer her your other one. too much lactose in feeds can lead to reducing substance positivity in stool examination. if pus cells in stool are less than 5, its normal. if you are breastfeeding your baby, she is less likely to suffer from diarrhea. this is because your milk helps to prevent the growth of the bacteria that cause it. in my opinion, you should follow these measures:1. breastfeed regularly. let her finish from breast before you offer from the other breast.2. start her on probiotic such as enterogermina once daily. if she has fever or her stools have pus cells more than 5 and the stool consistency and color continues to worry you, you may contact me."

"about a year ago , late summer of 2009 an sex girlfriend of mine gave me oral sex . from that point on my penis has hurt inside if i pinch it , it feels like rocks are inside and if i pinch it they go away . a have no clue if that is actually what is happening , but that just what it feels like.last winter ( the winter that allowed the oral sex , ) a was kissing my girl friend , and when she left , a had to go pee and saw blood on the top of my penis , but it want continuous bleeding a just wiped it off and nothing happened there was no pain or anything . that do these things mean ?",1,46870,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. bleeding after sex can occur in women of all ages, but it is not unusual at all when a girl is in her teen years because her own menstrual cycle is still maturing and also chafing inside from sex can occur. furthermore, any bleeding from the uterus can produce cramps, even if it's at the incorrect time. condoms are extremely effective in preventing pregnancy if they were applied before any genital contact and remain on during intercourse and when you pull out. furthermore, the most common sign of pregnancy is a missed menstrual period, so if your girlfriend has not actually missed a cycle she really does not need to worry about pregnancy. if your girlfriend herself is also on birth control pills, irregular bleeding and spotting can be a side effect of the pill as well. so in summary, there are lots of reasons why your girlfriend could be bleeding irregularly, but if you are using proper contraception and condoms, pregnancy is not really one of the things you need to be concerned about. if your girlfriend starts to bleed regularly after sex she really should be evaluated by a doctor, as inflammation or infections of the cervix can cause postcoital (after sex) bleeding as well. i hope that i was adequately able to answer your question today, and that my advice was reassuring. best wishes,"

"by father is 71+ , in the year ongoing a regular check up test in ultrasound we found that his not kidney is 61mm and left kidney is normal in size . any way now in the year 2013 ongoing ultra sound we found the kidney remains same but prostrate is normal in size but it shows calcific loci in it . well my father is very nervous a person he is thinking that it is leading to cancer . please suggest that can this calcific lead to cancer ?",1,79378,"hi, thanks for writing in. the left kidney is normal and appearance. the right kidney size is normal, but there is an appearance described as increased fullness of the renal pelvis. the renal pelvis connects the kidney collecting system to the ureter. in your case, there is no infection or stone which is causing obstruction to flow of urine. however, this can be seen in normal people due to increased pressure of urine in the kidney or also as a normal variant from birth. it is suggested that you please get the ultrasound scan done after passing the urine and this will confirm any back pressure effects on the right kidney. in most cases it does not require treatment. please do not worry."

"hi . i am mariana , from last 6 months i was getting my periods delayed , sometime heavy bleeding but often i had only spotting . today i went for pelvic ultrasonography which shows retention cyst of 14mm * 10mm in right ovary.i am married and want to conceive . what do next ? ? ply reply",1,31114,"hi, welcome to chat doctor. i am chat doctor. i will be answering your concerns today. furthermore, i am giving you some statistics to relax your mind. among couples trying for conception only 25% conceive during each cycle, 80% conceive in a years time and about 90% conceive in 2 years time you are married for six months. stop worrying. you probably did the ultrasound during ovulation time. that is why a small amount of fluid was seen due to rupture of follicle. this is a normal finding. do not worry about it. this fluid will not affect your fertility. if you repeat ultrasound immediately after periods, you will not see this fluid on ultrasound. if you have regular cycles, in all probability you are ovulating, and you need not worry. to increase your chances of pregnancy, you both should maintain normal bmi, stop smoking (if smoker), and have intercourse3-4 ines in a week. if you do not conceive in another six months time, consult gynecologist. i hope this is helpful. best wishes, chat doctor."

"ave been having sharp pain in my chest radiating outward from the bottom of my sternum towards my lungs and rib cage its especially on the right side during this it sometimes causes intense pain in my groin area they've done full blood panels and eggs and say in good to go as well as chest x-rays and they have also told me my oesophagus , gallbladder are fine .",1,41649,"hello. thank you for your question and welcome to chat doctor. i understand your concern. well, i am going to try and explain the differences between various origins of the pain which can arise from the rib cage. there is angina. it is described more like mid-chest heaviness or squeezing sensation, that is triggered by exercise and relieved by rest, which radiates to the both sides of the chest, to the jaw and left arm and shoulder. it is indicative of a blockage within one or more coronary arteries and reflects the lowering of blood supply to the heart muscle. an ekg obtained in the moment of chest pain, if it fills this description, would be helpful. then there is pleuritic chest pain. this kind of pain is sharp, stabbing pain that can happen in any part of the chest area. no radiation like in anginal pain. it arises from acute or chronic inflammation of the linings that are within the rib cage: pleura (lining of the lungs) or pericardium (lining of the heart) or both. in this regard, i would recommend a chest x-ray for pleural inflammation or effusion. in case of pericardial pain and anginal pain, echocardiogram is helpful, by evaluating the size, motility and function of heart muscle and valves, and also by assessing the pericardium and whether there is fluid build-up within it, or not. other causes of chest pain are related to the locomotion system of the rib cage: muscle soreness, bone and cartilage-related pain. in the end, stress can also cause chest pain. i hope i was helpful with my answer. best regards,"

in an 18 year old girl and have been experiencing chest pain . a read it may be stress . a have had unexplained symptoms for the past 2 years regarding increased heart rate and now i get dizzy often and can hear something odd in my left ear . in normally happy and healthy but i feel worn out and depressed most days,1,49642,hello read through your query. insensitive tooth is nothing but the tooth which has lost its life(tooth with necroses pulp). nothing to be worried in this case. you can go to an endodontist and get it filled by rootcanaltreatment procedure(if it's causing any pain or problems to you). if it's not showing any symptoms like pain be cool and enjoy eating. this insensitive tooth may be caused due to some trauma years back or due to any caries in the tooth which has gone deep into the pulp and killed the pulp. in my view it has nothing to do with your bilateral numbness of feet as you have insensitivity to a tooth. if it causes insensitivity to all tooth then we can suspect bilateral numbness can do something with this and go for investigation for that. so for now be cool to enjoy your life. best part of your life. stressfree and happy mind lets you stay fit year after year. hope you have benefitted something with this reply. have a healthy day!!!

hello or my bypass sergeryhas done 3 months before butcher being cut for operation in vertical two projectionfrom insidefeeling hard and paining also chest sidefeeling cum and pain what too in this case . pain will be normal or after some month it will be automatically normal pm give me suggest,1,81894,"here you need to know if it's a normal fracture with just a cut in bone it takes 1 month to heal, if there is cut with segmental fracture where the fracture piece is not in touch with bone above and bone below then it takes 2-3 months time to heal. but if there is segmental fracture along with crushed bone pieces then it takes 4-6 month time to heal. now here you need to see which kind of fracture you are having along with this age as well your diet and calcium with vitamin d tablets also matter a lot for healing. here you have informed some doctors have suggested for bone grafting and some doctors have suggested to wait. i suggest if your fracture is healing and is better than what it was before after few months on x-ray then don't worry it will be all right. it may take some time. you need to have good enough of calcium with vitamin d in diet as well as supplement. but if there is no healing sign even after 3-4 month, and it is still as it is meaning you can try with calcium and vitamin d supplement for 2 months and see later on x-ray. or else you can go ahead for surgery that is bone grafting. if it's paining too much then make sure there is no infection as well no displacement of implant. and you can keep using hot and cold pack for some more relief. i have given you here general guideline, but i am sure this will be useful for you. take care."
hello or my bypass sergeryhas done 3 months before butcher being cut for operation in vertical two projectionfrom insidefeeling hard and paining also chest sidefeeling cum and pain what too in this case . pain will be normal or after some month it will be automatically normal pm give me suggest,2,5545,"hello and thank you for using chat doctor. i carefully read your question and i understand your concern. i will try to explain something and give you my opinion. this fluttering sensation has to do with some electrical issues in the heart. the electrical issues might be different. it might be a simple sinus tachycardia meaning that your heart is beating over 100 beats for minute, and you feel your heart fluttering. it might be a different arrhythmia, like atrial fibrillation when your heart runs in a chaotic way. i don't think it is your case. or the fluttering sensation might be what we call an extra-sistolik beat, that is a premature heart contraction during its normal rhythm.these is quite normal in young people with normal hearts. all these rhythm issues might give flutter sensation, chest discomfort or pain, anxiety, difficulties in breathing deeply. the cause might be different from simple emotional stress to excessive coffee consumption, alcohol. it is important to avoid them during this time. the other cause might be pathologies like anemia, hyperthyroidism, cardiac anomalies. so, if i was your treating doctor i would do the same that your doctors has already done, a rhythm holder monitoring. it will give a fool view of your rhythm tendency and show what are these fluttering sensations. i will also recommend a blood check up and your thyroid hormones. after this we can better judge what to do. hope i was helpful. best regards."

"there a a needle stuck in my head q.last night i was sewing my project then one of my needle was missing then i go to sleep , when i woke up i sleep again in the sofa and the needle was there ! the needle was stuck in my head ! how do i get it out without pain ? i done want to tell my parents cause it will be much trouble",1,95176,"hi, thanks for writing in. a 4 mm lesion in the breast is too small to characterize. the needle fnac was offered probably to be more accurate in making a diagnosis. if the lump of cells in the 4 mm area was properly targeted then appearance of liquid confirms the presence of a cyst with fluid. even in the aspirated fluid, there would have been cells and i guess that slides were prepared and seen under a microscope in your case. if it was indeterminate then it means that no cancer cells were confirmed in the area. technically speaking even if the 4 mm area was burst with the needle then the cells were confined to a closed area and will not spill over to any other area. also, it might have been close to the skin surface. please be informed that breast cancer does not have a tendency to spread by a needle track. therefore, you are completely safe from this procedure. keeping in mind the indeterminate nature of the fluid from the cyst it is advisable to go for regular clinical examinations and also do self breast exam once every 15 days and consult your doctor should you have any doubts regarding any new breast lumps. please do not worry."

"i a have been trying for a baby and tested yesterday , the 28 the day of my cycle , it came back not pregnant but a keep getting a bit of blood hardly anything for the past 3 days and stomach cramps as if a am going to start my period for the past week my monthly cycles are a bit irregular as a have thyroid problems e.g last month it was 26 days the month before it was 34 days . pm a defiantly not pregnant . thanks",1,8772,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the proper way to use the nearing is to put it in, leave it in for 3 weeks, take it out, wait one week, and replace it. during the week you are not wearing the ring, you should have some bleeding that is considered a menstrual cycle. if you wore the ring continuously for two months and then had a new one replaced but only removed it 3 days later, the pinkish spotting was your ""period"", which is caused by not wearing the ring. the bleeding was very light because you had suppressed it by continuously wearing the ring for over 2 months. so you should expect your next period about 4-5 weeks after the episode of spotting that you had. if you do not have menses by then, i recommend repeating the pregnancy test at that time. if you did not have regular monthly cycles before you used the ring, your cycle will follow your regular pattern that you typically have when not using hormonal contraception. if you are trying to get pregnant, you should have intercourse about every other day and begin taking prenatal vitamins as it benefits the health of the baby for the vitamins to be present at conception. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"hello .. a am a 28 year old male who has been feeling dizziness , nausea and headaches for the past few weeks . a have taken a blood test and everything seemed okay until a reached my mchc level which is at 36 g/dl and my rdw-sd is at 38 . would this be causing my symptoms ? and of so do a need to do any further exams ? or take something ? that exactly does it mean ?",1,58814,"hi there, it is difficult to know exactly what is causing your symptoms at this time. i would like some more information, and i think that perhaps you ought to consider going to see your family physician. feeling anxious and depressed for brief periods mean your symptoms could be related to panic attacks. however, the headaches that you are describing could be from a number of different causes. they could be cluster headaches which often respond well to treatment. elevated blood pressure can cause headaches, but usually it isn't related to headaches that come and go like yours. overall, i think its best if you discuss your symptoms with your primary care doctor, who will be able to obtain more information, check your blood pressure, and write you a prescription for any medication you might need for your headaches. i wish you the best of luck, and hope my answer was helpful to you."

"a have been having spells for about a month now with severe nausea followed by sneezing ... its getting worse every day i am female 5ft4 and weigh 120 its coming on every 2 or 3 hours now and its affecting my work , these spells last anywhere from 3 to 5 minutes sometimes i feel faint when it happens",1,45128,"hello and thanks for the query, i would first explain to you about the female reproduction and then some ways to recognize when is the best chance of getting pregnant. the female is designed in such a way that every month on about the 14th day of a regular 28 days cycle, one female egg called ovum is released from the ovary, and it goes to the tube and gets fertilized by a male sperm if there has been a recent sexual contact. so if sexual contact occurs during ovulation then only pregnancy will result. having contact on all other days of the month will not lead to pregnancy. the day of ovulation varies, and it may occur on any day from day 10-20 from the first day of the menses. hence this is called the fertile period. so for having a maximum chance of getting pregnant a healthy female egg, an open female genital tract [that is no block in tubes, cervix and a normal uterus and its lining] are important. ovulation can be detected by measuring the body temperature every day before getting up from bed using a special thermometer called a bbt thermometer. after ovulation the female body temperature increases by about 0.5 to 1 degree. another way is to check the cervical mucus. the mucus is thin and watery during ovulation period. special ovulation detecting kits and sonography can also be used to detect it. as of now i recommend you try to keep alternate day sexual contact between day 10-20 of the cycle for 6 months. if there is no success, visit an infertility specialist to look for any cause for not getting pregnant. also start taking b complex and folic acid tablets if you are planning pregnancy as they help prevent birth defects in the baby. hope this was helpful. thanks for using chatdoctori am always here for any further queries. chatdoctor bagdeconsultant ob gone."

now could contracting genital herpes have an affect on someone who previously had bacterial meningitis when they were younger but is now 21 ? and what would be the early signs for a man if he might have been exposed to the herpes virus due to a condom breaking ?,1,45075,"hello, short answer: yes, you could have herpes. detailed answer: if your partner has herpes then it is very probable that he has transmitted it to you. herpes virus is very contagious and since you have had unprotected sex then it is highly likely for you to have got it as well. transmission can occur, even the context of intact and healthy looking skin and genital mucosa, and absence of symptoms. transmission can occur through any kind of contact with the infected person: anal, sexual, fingering, oral sex. you might be completely asymptomatic during your entire life or signs and symptoms could come and go from time to time, and this is different from one individual to another. however, please note that herpes virus is the most common virus among human populations. it has no cure, but some antivirals might help to lessen symptoms. there is no universal protection from it. even condoms protect only in about one third of cases as it depends on how it is used (if hand is contaminated then the condom cannot stop the infection). the final suggestion: if you have got it, get used to it and life goes on. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

(the amount of platelets in the bloodstream is reduced because the spleen is busy trapping them). so usually people with cirrhosis end up having a problem with portal hypertension and an enlarged spleen, and a reduced platelet count in the bloodstream. as time goes by, the liver may try to repair itself by growing new cells. if there is a lot of scar tissue already present the new cells grow between scar tissue (and result in abnormal nodules). the nodules and scar tissue further interfere with blood flow through the liver. so over time people with advanced cirrhosis can end up having a problem with more and more abnormal nodules and scar tissue forming which interferes even more with blood flow through the liver which makes the spleen continue to enlarge, and the platelet count continue to chat doctor. the splenomegaly is usually not reversible. please go for regular medical follow up. hope this helps"

i was six weeks pregnant before taking cytotec.after the second day i felt itching in my private part so i decided to buy ampiclox to stop it . i want to know if it is safe taking ampiclox while am still bleeding though its been six days now . thank you,1,55065,"hallow dear, i gather from your history that you have sex about 21 days before the menses. it is very unlikely that sex on this day would lead to pregnancy. moreover, you are on regular birth control pills though the timing everyday may be variable. however, the bleeding during the so-called period was brownish and scanty. so the possibility of pregnancy has to be assessed. seven days after (?) missed period, pregnancy test gives reliable result. though the first test you performed was too early to be reliable, the second test was after five days. it is also negative. so the chances of pregnancy are practically nil. still i would request you to perform pregnancy test on overnight sample of first morning urine sample afterv4 days again. if this is also negative, you are not pregnant. you may go for ultrasonography to rule out blighted ovum in aborting process. mostly this appears to be less bleeding due to hormonal imbalance. if you are taking progesterone dominant pills, they can cause such a low bleeding. if you do not get regular bleeding after one week, please report to the gynecologist."

myself may krishnabepari .in a few days ago i taste my blood .but my direct bilirubin is 0.67mg and total bilirubin is 1.43 so i take arogyavardani vati.punarnavadimandur and udarvmati vat .one tab daily take after meals with warm water .its of or not pm tell me my email id as soon as possible yyyy @ yyyy,1,65018,"hi thanks for the question. i assume that your baby is more than a week old. most of the babies have yellow discoloration of skin and sclera during the first few days of life. this is called physiological jaundice, and it subsides on its own without any intervention. this is a normal phenomenon as a result of transition from fetal to extrauterine life. you should be aware when jaundice is a cause of concern: 1. if jaundice appears on first day of life2. if the level of bilirubin is more than 12 mg/dl. bilirubin is the substance that causes the yellow coloration of skin. its level can be checked with a blood test .3. if the rise in bilirubin level is more than 5 mg/dl/hr. for this your doctor my prescribe repeated test and then plot the levels on a graph to predict the expected rise in bilirubin.4. if direct bilirubin is more the 2 mg/dl or 20% of the total. bilirubin is of two types physiological jaundice is due to the water insoluble indirect bilirubin so if direct component is high it means it's not physiological and should be a cause for concern. the direct and indirect breakage is given in the blood test. 5. if your baby is otherwise unwell e.g. is lethargic, is not feeding well, has fever or difficulty breathing then its not physiological jaundice because in that case your baby will be otherwise totally ok. you have asked if your baby needs incubator care. incubators are for premature babies who can not maintain their body temperatures as they have arrived earlier, and temperature control mechanisms have not yet been established. the incubator provides specific temperature. incubators are not used for the treatment of any type of jaundice. phototherapy is used for that. these are specially lights that convert the indirect water insoluble bilirubin into water soluble forms that can then be excreted out through urine. as i have told high levels of direct bilirubin are a cause of concern and these need treatment with a phototherapy unit. your doctor may prescribe phototherapy if your child has any of the criteria i have mentioned earlier, but incubator care is not needed as your baby is not premature and is at least older than a week. if you have any other questions i will be happy to answer."

hello my question i normally do have pretty regular cycles only ever a day late at the least however me and my significant other had unprotected intercourse where he ejaculated in me and oddly enough my period is late this month should have started 1/20/14 but has yet to show up and the month is nearly over ply help its strange an stressful any info would be great ?,1,15745,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. first, if you are late for your shot and have had unprotected sex, even if you are bleeding, you should do a urine pregnancy test. if your pregnancy test is negative, many women do not have regular periods come back after discontinuing the depo-provera injection for even up to 6 months. this, however, does not mean that you cannot become pregnant. if you are not actively trying to get pregnant, a good way to help regulate your cycles until your own body resumes a regular cycle is by taking birth control pills. birth control pills make you get a light, regular, predictable cycle every month and will help control breakthrough bleeding (the brown staining you have all the time). many women have irregular bleeding in the first 6 months to a year of using the shot, and unfortunately the same thing can happen after you discontinue it. so, in summary, all the irregular bleeding you are having is likely due to your discontinuing the demo shot. if you need contraception, the monthly cycle birth control pill would be a good option that can also help you have regular cycles. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"
hello my question i normally do have pretty regular cycles only ever a day late at the least however me and my significant other had unprotected intercourse where he ejaculated in me and oddly enough my period is late this month should have started 1/20/14 but has yet to show up and the month is nearly over ply help its strange an stressful any info would be great ?,2,49266,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. if you last had your period on september 12th, and today is october 5th, your period is not yet late for october. most women have a 25-35 day cycle, so until you actually miss your period for october, there is no reason to assume you are pregnant. the folic acid and zinc you are taking are just extra vitamins that provide health to a growing pregnancy; these should not affect or change your menstrual cycle or its symptoms. if your period is late in october, you should purchase and perform an over-the-counter pregnancy test. modern pregnancy tests are very accurate and can be positive even 10 days after conception. if you do find out you are pregnant, there is nothing that needs to be done immediately as pregnancy is not a disease- it is a normal state for women in the reproductive phase of their lives. so it is important only to keep taking your vitamins, get plenty of rest, eat a balanced diet and avoid alcohol, caffeine and chat doctor. if your period is mate, but you are not pregnant, the delay in your cycle can have a number of causes, including hormonal imbalances, certain medical conditions like thyroid disease, and even the stress of worrying about pregnancy. if you miss more than 2 months of your cycle (no bleeding for 3 months) and your pregnancy test is negative, you should see a physician for a hormonal evaluation. so in summary, a late menstrual cycle can be caused by pregnancy, but there are other causes as well. i suggest you perform a pregnancy test if you are late, and if it is negative, try to be patient, and you will likely get it before another month goes by. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"a of a 23 year old guy , a of loosing of erections these days",3,10007,thanks for contacting chat doctor with your health care concerns am sorry to hear that you have had a change in the shape or curvature of your penis. this is a result of trauma and damage to the blood vessels in the penis. this is called parodies disease and is caused by a plaque or damage to the vessels inside the penis that helps with erections. there is nothing you can do to fix or repair or lessen the effects of that trauma. the damage may get better with time and can improve over a 1 year. if there is no improvement then the urologist can do injections to help reduce the plaque and improve the circulation to improve erections. there can be pain with erections from the scarring. i hope this answers your question. please contact chat doctor again with any of your health care concerns

(as you said he has difficulty in walking now). you can also say to his parents that --- they can continue with all religious customs along with medicines, may be then they will agree... with medicine, he will start showing improvement in few days only... it is psychosis and patients will not agree to go to any doctor willingly, so you might need to take him forcefully. this is well accepted as it is for his benefit only. even if he doesn't agree for oral medicine there are injectables which are given to such patients... take the right step, take him to a doctor. hope the reply is useful feel free to ask more questions"

my son is two and a half years old . his up front four teeth are damaged . the enamel started falling off since they were formed and now only stubs are left with a blackish appearance on the inside . all other teeth are normal . what could be the reason behind this and what can i do ?,1,53291,"hello, enamel can be damaged by acid in the mouth. the stomach acid included in vomit with repeat episodes can easily damage the enamel on teeth. this would occur after the teeth are erupted and have been exposed to the acidic environment. this could then be the case with the baby teeth. now you state the adult teeth have weak enamel. this could be a genetic weakness. nutrition and medication taken while the teeth are forming will affect the quality of the tooth structure. baby teeth can be damaged if baby sleeps with a bottle with milk products coating teeth and causing decay. fluoride can be given with child chat doctor. as adults the addition of fluoride is not recommended because teeth are already formed. instead, topical fluoride can help strengthen formed tooth enamel. too much fluoride taken as a child can have the reverse effect of weakened enamel forming. often white spots are seen and indicate too much fluoride. the antibiotic tetracycline is known to darken the layer under enamel and cause gray to brown banding if taken while teeth are forming. no concern with this type of discoloration when taken as an adult. the medication, pizotifen, does not report any significant dental side effects concerning enamel. this is not available in the united states, so i am not familiar with this"

"i i miss my periods this month the due date was 30 but its 6 today and i still didst get it i had some spotting around 25 days back , which was almost equal to negligible . i did urine test today morning , it was negative . what should i do now ? .",1,8772,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the proper way to use the nearing is to put it in, leave it in for 3 weeks, take it out, wait one week, and replace it. during the week you are not wearing the ring, you should have some bleeding that is considered a menstrual cycle. if you wore the ring continuously for two months and then had a new one replaced but only removed it 3 days later, the pinkish spotting was your ""period"", which is caused by not wearing the ring. the bleeding was very light because you had suppressed it by continuously wearing the ring for over 2 months. so you should expect your next period about 4-5 weeks after the episode of spotting that you had. if you do not have menses by then, i recommend repeating the pregnancy test at that time. if you did not have regular monthly cycles before you used the ring, your cycle will follow your regular pattern that you typically have when not using hormonal contraception. if you are trying to get pregnant, you should have intercourse about every other day and begin taking prenatal vitamins as it benefits the health of the baby for the vitamins to be present at conception. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"
"i i miss my periods this month the due date was 30 but its 6 today and i still didst get it i had some spotting around 25 days back , which was almost equal to negligible . i did urine test today morning , it was negative . what should i do now ? .",2,448,"hello and i hope i can help you today.first, i want to reassure you that it is not possible that you could have conceived if you had unprotected sex before your implant was removed. implanon is nearly 100 percent effective in preventing pregnancy while it is in place, and it takes time for you to ovulate again (at least 7-10 days) after it is removed. so if you only had unprotected sex immediately before and after your implant was removed, it is unlikely you could have conceived so quickly. pregnancy symptoms vary widely between women, and many of the same symptoms we commonly associate with pregnancy such as nausea, bloating, breast tenderness, headaches and irregular bleeding can also happen from an irregular menstrual cycle as well as pregnancy. many women have irregular periods after discontinuing a hormonal birth control method. so, i suggest you wait for your period, which should occur around 4 weeks after your implant removal, and if you miss your period, a urine pregnancy test will be accurate at this time. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful. best wishes,"

a am on birth control for the past 3 months and i haven to missed any pills - however i just realised i had sex during what i assume was my ovulating day last week . that are the chances of me being pregnant ? a am finding that i need to urinate every few hours the last few days so has my both control failed ?,1,74652,"hallow dear, trust pills are birth control pills having ethanol estradiol, levonorgestrel and ferrous fumarate. the last is iron to complete 28 days. first two are the hormonal components which give the effect of birth control. after getting the menses, you shifted to daphne which contains lynestrenol (progesterone). both these pills are good birth control pills provided they are consumed regularly. however, i would suggest you to stick to trust. you had sexual intercourse 3 days after your menstruation while on the pills. so the chances of the pregnancy are very rare. when you are taking birth control pills regularly, you are well protected from the pregnancy, whenever you may have intercourse. moreover, your intercourse was not during the fertile period. !4 days prior to the next menses (when you are not on pills), the egg release (ovulation) occurs. egg has got a life of 24 hours and sperms are active for 72 hours. hence, a period of about one week around the day of ovulation is considered as fertile period. your intercourse was far away from this period. also, you are not having any feel of the pregnancy too. furthermore, you are on the pills regularly. so you are not forming eggs. therefore, most probably you are not pregnant. the delay in your menstruation may be due to change and irregularity in the composition of the pills. progesterone only pills are known to cause less bleeding. delay by two days should not be considered as delay. still to confirm the diagnosis, please wait for 1 week more and then perform urine pregnancy test on the overnight morning first urine sample. earlier these tests may give false negative results. if you do not want to wait that long, you may go for beta chat doctor test which gives reliable results even few days before missing period. this should take away your stress. and finally, even if the pills have failed (which is very rare) and you are pregnant, you can terminate the pregnancy safely by medicines up to 9 weeks. i hope this helps you."

(we call this osmosis phenomenon). for this effect, we need to check the blood sugar at midnight around 2am or so. if this midnight glucose level is very low, then we have to decrease your night insulin levels. therefore, the best for you is to go immediately to your treating doctor and adjust the insulin dose you are taking. regards"

hi there my daughter knocked her shin on a climbing frame around 4 weeks ago there was a shaping of the skin and a bruise ... which disappeared after a few weeks however there is still a golf sized lump under the skin which i am worried about what could this be ? ? ? the says it is not painful and is not complaining of any discomfort .,1,63994,"dear user, a soft lump, after an injury with skin bruise on it is most likely a small collection of blood under the skin, hematoma, unless there was already a lipoma (a lumpy collection of fat under the skin) there, which became more obvious after the trauma which is less likely (given the fact that you didn't mention its presence before)if it is not increasing in size or the skin is not damaged, you could give her some anti-inflammatory (neuron) and cold packs, and it should settle down in few days, as blood absorbs. in case the lump persists even after the discoloration is settled, you can get it checked for the presence of skin cyst or lipoma. it is always advisable to take her to doctor regardless of the lump, to get her ribs examined, esp if she is in loads of pain. hope it answered your query, do write back if anything else. good luck"

"a have a sinus infection , a was diagnosed today at the doctors . it night , a am salivating or drooling excessively . it is a feeling a get when a want to throw up . to far , it only makes me feel like throwing up . the worse a cough the more my mouth is watering .",1,77258,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the sensation of feeling something stuck in your throat is a symptom of reflux-when the food that you eat or the acid in your stomach can back up and irritate it. this is common when you have a large belly at full term because your stomach is being pushed up towards your chest and also the hormones from the pregnancy cause the top opening of your stomach that connects to your esophagus to be looser, so food and acid can leak more easily. the best way to try to control this is to eat only small amounts at one time and to make sure you sit up for at least 2 hours after meals. taking antacids, which for the most part are all safe during pregnancy, can also help. trying to cough up what you feel in your throat will not help because there is not actually something solid coming up. these symptoms may be difficult to treat, but the good news is the symptoms will get better after you have the baby. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

a have a new birth control pack that is supposed to start tomorrow ( ended the in actives today ) a went to go to bed and realized the first 2 pills ( sunday and monday are missing ) ... a done know what happened to them if took them in my sleep or what ... but a done know what to do ? should a just continue until tuesday and restart taking the pills then ?,1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

hi i stopped taking my pill for medical reasons just because i was bleeding in between my pill microgynon 30 that was at 9th feb had slight light bleed just a 4 i stopped all pill in that cycle had unprotected sex about two week after and live still not got my period i feel like in going to come on have all signs but no bleed . could i be pregnant or is it side affect from coming off pill was taking microgynon for 6 months .,1,1599,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the morning after pill is 90 percent effective if taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse. so, regardless of what happened with your pill taking before your pill-free week, the morning-after pill should still be effective. many women have a delayed period after taking the morning-after pill as a side effect, but the possibility of pregnancy still exists if you are late, so you should perform a urine pregnancy test just in case. if it has not been 2 weeks yet since your unprotected encounter, it may be too early to have a positive pregnancy test, so i would repeat it in a week if that is the case. in addition, many women have an irregular period or skip entirely after they stop the pill. if you are not pregnant, you can start a new pack of pills as soon as you get them, but just use a condom as a backup for the first two weeks. you should get a period in the pill-free week as you did previously. i hope i was able to answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

i this is 23 year male from board getting my left hand tingling and heart side pain . a have completed all the related test but i done get single result positive . a consulted to doctor he gave a medication of blood pressure still not getting any relief . suggest me better as possible .,1,109169,"hi there there are a lot of things to explain in this but ill try to explain you in short so that you can understand. heart has two sides right and the left, right side of the heart receives used blood that returns from the body parts and right ventricles pump this blood to lungs to supply it with oxygen again and to make it reusable to the tissues now this oxygenated blood is returned from the lungs to left heart which pumps it back to whole body. that's how circulation is completed. now coming to your sons case, right ventricle (rv) can dilate due to various reasons and we summaries them in two scenarios pressure and volume overload. pressure overload happens when there is some sort of resistance in the normal blood flow as some lung pathology and volume overload is due to extra amount of blood entering the right side of the circulation from some abnormal pathway like some congenital heart defect or some valve incompetency of right heart. your son had episodes of chest pain which is not a good sign, he probably needs a bilateral lower limb doppler to rule out any sort of blood clot which could have embolized from there to heart and lungs leading to pain and a dialed rv and murmur. good luck"

"my sister has a small growth on the joint of kidney and the ureter , one doctor said it is prone area for malignancy , so the biopsy was taken . the result was negative , result was hyperplasia . but still i am not satisfied . to the doctor said to review after 3 months.can you give me more satisfied answer .",1,33931,"hi michele jacobi the first thing that has to be done once you find a lump in the region of the chest wall is to confirm what it is. in your case a biopsy has already been done and let us await its result. you're understanding that cancerous lumps don't bleed after biopsy is correct. but i think your presumption that if it was scar tissue it would have bled is not correct. scar tissue also need not bleed. needle biopsies do not usually cause any bleeding unless a blood vessel is ruptured during the procedure since how long have you noticed this lump. is the size of the lump increasing ? if the biopsy comes as positive for cancer then you will have to undergo a series of investigation to find out he the extent of the disease. ? whether it is confined to the chest wall only or whether it has gone beyond the chest wall to other regions. treatment decision will depend on the results of this if the biopsy comes as negative for cancer then there are 2 options 1- if your physician thinks it is insignificant then you need to follow it up. just keep a check on your lump to see whether it is increasing in size and also get it checked by your physician regularly2- the second option (and my preference) is to do an open biopsy especially if the lump was detected recently and is increasing in size and also if the lump is firm to hard (and not very soft). the reason is needle biopsy can be negative, but this does not always mean there is no cancer especially if the tissue sample taken is not adequate. also time factor is important. you may lose time keeping the lump under follow up to see whether it is increasing in size hope you are satisfied with my reply. anyway don't worry. follow your doctors' advice chat doctor."

"i a was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2009 . it had spread to my lymph nodes and had them removed on the side of the cancer . a had chemo and radiotherapy but a lump was felt just above the site of the earlier cancer at a recent check up and was sent for an ultrasound where they took a tissue needle biopsy . a expected some bruising but haven to any . by concern is that cancerous lumps don to usually bleed and if it was scar tissue , which is the other option it probably would have bled ? ?",1,33931,"hi michele jacobi the first thing that has to be done once you find a lump in the region of the chest wall is to confirm what it is. in your case a biopsy has already been done and let us await its result. you're understanding that cancerous lumps don't bleed after biopsy is correct. but i think your presumption that if it was scar tissue it would have bled is not correct. scar tissue also need not bleed. needle biopsies do not usually cause any bleeding unless a blood vessel is ruptured during the procedure since how long have you noticed this lump. is the size of the lump increasing ? if the biopsy comes as positive for cancer then you will have to undergo a series of investigation to find out he the extent of the disease. ? whether it is confined to the chest wall only or whether it has gone beyond the chest wall to other regions. treatment decision will depend on the results of this if the biopsy comes as negative for cancer then there are 2 options 1- if your physician thinks it is insignificant then you need to follow it up. just keep a check on your lump to see whether it is increasing in size and also get it checked by your physician regularly2- the second option (and my preference) is to do an open biopsy especially if the lump was detected recently and is increasing in size and also if the lump is firm to hard (and not very soft). the reason is needle biopsy can be negative, but this does not always mean there is no cancer especially if the tissue sample taken is not adequate. also time factor is important. you may lose time keeping the lump under follow up to see whether it is increasing in size hope you are satisfied with my reply. anyway don't worry. follow your doctors' advice chat doctor."

"a am 21 years old . a gave birth about 4 months ago . only breastfed for 4 weeks . periods were normal . feb. 6 a started my period it lasted about 5 days and was normal . in feb. 15 a started again , it was heavy and a had to use pads to control it . a also had some blood clots . just the last two days it has slowed down . a have experienced some abdominal pain . nothing like menstrual cramps .",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

by 6yr old son is getting blackheads on his face . be had quite a large one on his lip that popped and he is now getting them on this chin and cheeks . that can we do to get rid of them and stop them from coming back ?,1,51034,"i am really sorry that your son is having to face these problems. you should have glasses with a tie at the back so that he cannot remove them. (of course, once he is sleepy or has gone to sleep, you can remove them for the entire night). there is no truth in the belief that if you keep the glasses on, the number will reduce. in fact, if his eye is developing a problem that will cause his number to increase, even his wearing the glasses continuously cannot prevent this from happening. there is nothing that you can do to ensure that these changes do not happen. your ophthalmologist is the best person to take counsel from. he should check the children lens and the entire eye to determine how the future will go. i would advise you to continue following his advice and to never neglect your sons eyes, as neglected error of refraction will affect his learning at school, his brain development and all aspects of his life. best wishes."

"hi , my daughter has a split uvula and was not able to have her adenoids removed as they felt , that it might affect her palate .. can this condition cause problems with teeth development , she only got broken fragments as baby teeth now her adult ones are coming and there coming threw rotten ?",1,33952,"hi. welcome to chat doctor . i have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. as per your complaint it seems that your daughter has a ifid uvula, and it occurs when there is a developmental disturbance leading to incomplete fusion of the two sides of the palate leading to a ifid uvula. it is true that it adenoidectomy is performed in this case and if there is incomplete fusion of the palate there can be an opening formed between nose and mouth and can further deteriorate the condition. the other problem that you are facing is that as she has only broken fragments of baby teeth present that means that she has a condition of aggressive cavities or caries known as rampant caries and when the infection progresses from teeth to the roots it can also effect the underlying growing permanent tooth buds leading to permanently stained, deformed or malformed teeth. it is a matter of concern because the child has to continue with the permanent teeth throughout life. so i would suggest you to consult a periodontist and get evaluated, and he can do a thorough clinical evaluation and x-rays of the teeth and can advise appropriate treatment like fluoride application, fillings r capping of teeth depending upon the condition of permanent teeth. hope this information helps. thanks and regards. chat doctor."
