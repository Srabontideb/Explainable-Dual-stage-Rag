"for the fifth time a have had the same bizarre occurrence , my upper lip on the left side swells up and a get a round quarter size rash on my left breast . each time they have both occurred in the exact location and the day prior a have had flu like symptoms with a low grade fever . a have asked my doctor and he thinks it a a coincidence and a mild allergic reaction . a feel like it a viral . any ideas ?",1,82366,"hello friend, thank you for posting your query through chat doctor. i am a homeopath answering your query and the answer which i am going to give you may contain several thoughts which may appear strange or new for you. this i say because homeopathy is a new system of medicine and is almost unheard by the majority of the population. therefore, due to the high influence of the conventional medicine the people at large are brainwashed to believe and act according to the health education given by them. coming back to the fibroadenoma of your left breast in the year 1979, you had a psychological conflict in the mind level. you are a sensitive individual and that is why your left breast was affected. it must have been related with your child chat doctor. the sensitivity is genetic, and you reacted to the conflict through the brain according to a genetic programming. mind-brain - organ affection resulted in the development of a lump in your left breast in 1979. you consulted your gynecologist, and he suggested that it may turn to become cancerous in future and so it is better to remove it, and you subdued to his suggestion. actually the lump in the breast was an attempt of the body to cure you, or it was the result of a self defense mechanism. since you had not resolved the conflict in the psychological level, the lump remained there without getting resolved. but the body kept the lump protected in a cyst with minimum amount of inflammation called chronic cystitis. by removing the fibroadenoma or chronic cystic mastitis, you were not cured, but your lump in the breast was removed. in 1995 also you are the same person, you are the same sensitive person, and you underwent another more serious psychological conflict and the same left breast was again affected in a more serious manner. instead of recognizing the mass as a defense mechanism, you got the fear in you that you have cancer. the tissue changes also suggested that there is more serious pathology, and they labelled your lump this time as cancer and suggested removal of your left breast. if you could have recognized the lump as a defense mechanism and if you had no fear of cancer, you could have retained your breast. but the fear of cancer is such that it is associated with death and so you lost your breast. in no case, either by removal of lump in 1979 or by removal of your breast in 1995, you are not cured only your disease is cured. hope by this time you have got the answer for your query. both are related to each other because they are in the same individual, same sensitivity, same program. homeopathy cures the person and once the individual is cured all his diseases will be cured. with best wishes,"

a had an ultrasound today on my abdomen . a was having some pain on the left side . at first a was told it could be diverticulitis after the scan a was told a had a twist in my bowel . a don to have any nausea or fever . just pain in my abdomen . a was told to wait to see if the twist will unfold . is this a good idea or should a see another doctor ?,1,52955,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. in the first trimester of pregnancy, your ovaries produce the hormone progesterone which normally is made by the placenta once it reaches adequate size. so it is not unusual in the first trimester pregnancy to feel pain in your ovaries. in addition, as your uterus stretches, you also may experience some cramping and pulling sensations, which can be on the sides. the only thing that is concerning is if you have not had an ultrasound this pregnancy to confirm that it is normal and located in your uterus. if you already have had an ultrasound for this pregnancy it is unlikely that there could be anything harmful going on, especially if you are not bleeding. so if the pain is severe enough that you cannot function, especially if you have not yet had an ultrasound, if you cannot reach her doctor within a reasonable amount of time, you may want to pursue care in an emergency setting. if you have had a normal ultrasound earlier in this pregnancy, you really do not need to worry, as your ovaries are normally examined as part of your pregnancy ultrasound and a large cyst would've already been detected. tylenol, or acetaminophen is safe to use for pain at the normal adult dosage during all trimesters of pregnancy, and you can try to see if that helps with the pain. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

hi i have dizzy spells but that could be because in anaemic ... but for the past couple of weeks live been having lot of pain in my feet from my ankle to the sole of my feet which make it extremely difficult for me to walk sometimes after live done work for the day .. however recently live been getting pins and needle during the day while in working an then the pain starts when in almost finished ...,1,91875,"foot pain is extremely common and can be pretty uncomfortable. since your foot pain comes after long periods of inactivity like getting up in the morning or after having been off your feet for some time, it is likely from a combination of muscle tightness and tendonitis. tendons are the structures that connect muscle to bone to help joints move. you have tendons on the inside and outside your foot to help your foot move and to keep your foot stable. these tendons can become inflamed in some situations of overuse or other situations where they are being overworked. the mainstay of treatment for tendonitis is ice(20 min 4 times a day) and anti-inflammatories. in addition, i like to recommend a combination of soft tissue treatments and exercises for the foot. you can use a lacrosse ball on the bottom and sides of your feet to work out tight areas. you can then follow by strengthening the foot by grabbing a towel using your toes and the releasing and repeating for 3 sets of 10 twice a day. if you continue to have pain, i recommend x-rays to rule out other causes and an examination by a specialist."

(would you be having it then?) now your cycle is of 30 days period. so the expected date of ovulation should be 07 january. hence, if the conception takes place on 07 january, the due date of delivery would be 30 september. the hitch here is that you should have ovulation taking lace on 07 january. moreover, we have noticed that all the pregnancies do not last for 280 days. the delivery can take place any time between 3 weeks earlier to 1 week later than the expected due date of delivery. keeping these facts and calculations in mind, you may plan your sexual relations accordingly. i hope this will help you."

i been etc for about 10 months now almost a year i had on miscarriage and we been having sex unprotected overtime i been trying to calculate my ovulation every single time and still nothing in found in only 19 years old but its been almost a year and still nothing,1,76346,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. fertomid is a type of fertility medication used help to cause ovulation in women who have trouble getting pregnant. because you did get pregnant (even though you had a miscarriage), unless you have been trying since then for over a year and been unable to conceive, the fatimid medication will not likely increase your chance of pregnancy significantly. therefore, even if you forgot to take some pills, you still have a significant chance of pregnancy as you are still very young, especially if you have regular menstrual cycles. if you and your husband have not been trying to conceive for more than a year on your own, i would not recommend using any fertility medication. using fatimid for more than four menstrual cycles can actually reduce your risk of pregnancy, as it decreases the effect of estrogen on your uterine lining. 80% of healthy couples will conceive within one year if they are having regular (at least 2 to 3 days per week) intercourse without contraception. one in 10 pregnancies will end in miscarriage, which means that 90% of the time couples will conceive a perfectly healthy pregnancy after a miscarriage without any form of medical treatment. so in summary, missing the fatimid tablets this particular month will not likely affect your chance of conceiving this cycle if you already ovulate naturally. i strongly recommend trying to get pregnant naturally for one year before using any type of fertility medication, as your body has proven that you can conceive even though that pregnancy did not work out. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this additional information was helpful. best wishes,"

a have had seizures in the past and they were due to a dead spot of brain tissue a good size too about 1/10 of the brain that never developed and was removed and a have a few seizures a year now compared to a doz a day because of another undeveloped spot deep in the brain and doctors don to want to mess with and a was wondering if since i chew tobacco occasionally if it effects seizures at all and how bad,1,74419,"hello, there is an increased risk of seizures following anesthesia, but typically the individuals already has a risk of having seizures if they occur. it is highly unlikely that lovenox would cause seizures, unless as you said there was bleeding into the brain, but that could be seen with a ct scan or mri. the symptoms you describe, although they can be seen in seizures, don't particularly strike me as such. a typical seizure involves convulsions with loss of consciousness. the period after seizures however can present as you described. there are more focal seizures that again can show up as you describe. continuous seizures would cause significant harm, most likely loss of consciousness as they often spread to involve the whole brain. in any case, an eeg should have been done on you to evaluate for true seizure activity, and if you haven't had one done, you definitely should. the description of the symptoms could easily be due to a migraine as some types of migraines can actually result in neurological symptoms with confusion, slurred speech, weakness, vision loss, and numbness/tingling. i feel that this would be more likely, unless an eeg was done, and it showed true seizure activity. surgeries can cause stress on the body which can result in both headaches and seizures. i don't think it is lovenox would cause either unless as you note there was bleeding in the brain. if an eeg was done and there is seizure activity, then she should be started on a seizure medication such as kendra 750 mg by mouth twice a day. if this is the case, then she has likely had a propensity for seizures, which was simply unmasked by the surgery. none them less an mri with and without contrast with an epilepsy protocol (thin t2 cuts through the temporal lobes) should be obtained to evaluate for any lesions in the brain. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

my sister 28 yrs old well educated says that she hears somebody talks bad about her always some time suddenly in sleep she wakes and scold very worst moreover if any tow persons were talking she think they were talking about her and fights with them she get overmuch angry and talks for 3 hrs ply give solution,1,43889,"the best thing you can do for your friend right now is to be really open, honest and frank with her in talking about this issue. she is going to find that everyone around her will do everything they can to avoid talking to her - not out of meanness, but because they simply don't know what to say and feel awful about this fact. people also sometimes feel guilty because they're fine and the other persons not. i would sit down with her during recess or lunch or whatever and just talk to her ... don't be afraid to ask her questions about her illness, how she found out, what her treatment options are, etc. she is probably really wanting to share all her thoughts and fears about this with someone her own age who won't react badly to it - you need to be that person, if you can. offer her a listening ear, a shoulder to cry on if she needs it and a helping hand in any way you can (like making sure if she misses something at school, that you'll help her to pick it up later, etc.). try to be as positive as you can about her prospects, and try to help her to not get really down (which she inevitably will at varying stages of her treatment, which can be really harsh). remember too, many people survive cancer, and she could well be one of them. i will pray for you both - her for surviving her illness and you for maintaining the strength of character to continue supporting her throughout her ordeal. for even thinking about this, you must already be a perfect friend."

a am recovering from a respiratory infection and am currently taking testis . yesterday a began experiencing a fluttering of my heart . the intensity seems to vary . would this be related to testosterone supplemental therapy ? a did not experience this before the bug had started .,3,31373,"hello. welcome to chat doctor, and thank you for your question. i carefully read your query. supplemental oxygen always helps in congestive heart failure patients. some of these patients need it with higher percentages of ejection fraction and some with lower. a congestive heart failure patient with a 20% function of the left ventricle is advised to be confined only to every-day duties and not various strains of a healthy heart or a slightly decreased heart function. a 20% functioning heart means that 80% of its content remains in the left ventricle (normal being 30-45%) in every cardiac cycle. this means that blood coming from the pulmonary circulation does not have space to empty, and all of this is interpreted as a raised pressure in this circulation. this produces fluid build up in lungs and difficulty to breath (dyspnea). therefore, the lower the heart function percentage, the higher and the more often the need for supplemental oxygen. besides oxygen, a good support to lowering the above-mentioned pulmonary circulation high pressure, are the diuretics, and in these figures, i would recommend a loop diuretic and a potassium-sparing diuretic to her therapy. no salt should be used in her diet, whatsoever, because it retains the water and further raises the pulmonary pressure. i hope i was helpful with my answer. take care. best regards,"

"a am 23 and am getting married soon , me and my boyfriend we have been trying to fall pregnant since last year by with no luck . before i met him a had an abortion and a think that might be the reason why a am not conceiving . a experience white discharge on my breast when i squeeze them . does breast discharge prevent pregnancy ?",1,24362,"hello...thanks for trusting the chat doctor doctors for your health related queries. i guess your concern is about.does breast discharge prevent pregnancy...right.well.yes, when there milk discharge from the breast it will prevent pregnancy. if u have milk discharge from your breast then it will prevent pregnancy. as u told that u had abortion, that may be the case of milk discharge from the breast, but abortion itself doesn't effect the future pregnancy. let us discuss the discharge u have in your breast. if u have milky discharge that means u had high prolactin hormone in your body. prolactin hormone is responsible for the milky discharge from the breast. it is usually high after delivery of the baby or any prolactin secreting tumor in the brain. these all conditions cause high prolactin level which causes difficulty in conceiving. but don't worry.every problem have solution. once your breast will go u can conceive. relax.keep patience.with the above discussion u can try out my suggestions-1. visit nearby gynecologist. feel free to ask about your problem. he/she can help u.2. u r come under reproductive age group(age from 15-45 years came under this group, in this group chances of getting pregnancy is high). so don't worry.3. if u r in hurry then visit nearby infertility specialist. he/she can help u. i hope the above information is useful, informative and helpful for u.regards- chat doctor. i pray the god that u will be blessed with a cute n healthy baby.hopefully twins)"

pm 29 years old and just wanted to know that are the chances of getting pregnant after having a laparotomy ... a had the surgery on march 2010 when a was 3 months pregnant ! by son is now 2 and my husband and a have been trying for the past 6 months but no luck yet . a a scared to think that a won to be able to conceive anymore,1,64838,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the pelvis that cannot be removed completely by surgery. the reason is that endometriosis implants can be microscopic, which is why ultimately most women are treated with hormones to suppress their menstrual cycle for 3 to 6 months after endometriosis surgery. this helps to prevent recurrence of cysts and scarring within your pelvis which may increase your chance of conceiving. however, while you are on the leuprolide (lu pron) injection, you will not menstruate regularly and is unlikely that you will become pregnant. your greatest chance of pregnancy is in the first six months after stopping the medication. because you only 32 years old, i would recommend doing a full six months of lu pron injections before trying to conceive again. so again to clarify, you do not need lu pron because you had any complications from your surgery, rather the issue is that lu pron reduces your risk of recurrence of endometriosis after surgery, which will help to maximize your chance of conceiving later. so there is no reason why you and your husband cannot have unprotected intercourse while you on the lu pron treatment, however the goal of the treatment is to reduce the inflammation your pelvis after the surgery to help you heal and also to reset your hormones so when you go off the lu pron you will be in the best shape to conceive. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that i helped clarify the role lu pron has in the treatment of endometriosis. i wish you and your husband the best of luck in conceiving,"

a did to have an ultrasound till i was 29 weeks pregnant . the ultrasound said that i a due on august 28 and that i conceived on december 5 . a either conceived at the end of november or on december 6 . is there any way to know if the ultrasound is correct or when i really conceived ?,1,40763,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the clearblue test is not very accurate in predicting gestational age. the amount of pregnancy hormone in a women urine can vary depending on the time of day she did the test and how much water she had to chat doctor. furthermore, many women have some bleeding in the first trimester of pregnancy, so the bleeding she had in december and january may not have been her real period at all. the most accurate way to test the age of a pregnancy, is an ultrasound exam to measure the fetus. this is normally done during the course of her routine prenatal care. an ultrasound is also necessary to determine if there is more than one fetus present. in your sisters case, if she conceived in november, the measurements of her uterus at this point would be accurate. so i would recommend that she have an ultrasound exam (which i am sure will be done soon as part of her routine prenatal care) to confirm her due date and the viability of the pregnancy. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes to your sister for her pregnancy,"

"by right testicle is swollen and getting larger . there is pain when it is touched and discomfort at rest . it has gotten huge over the last two days . a have iced it down with no affect . a have an appointment with my doctor tomorrow , should a be more concerned than that ?",1,69552,"thanks for putting up your query at chat doctor. i am sorry to hear that your 1-year-old son has a swollen testicle. however, there are a few more things that i would have liked to know. assuming that the swelling is actually affecting the testicle/testis and not any other structure in the scrotal sac, the first thing i would like to know is whether it was present since birth or whether it has developed recently. the second thing is whether it is associated with any redness and pain when touched. the third thing that i would like to ask is whether there is fever or any other symptoms present along with. now let me come to the possibilities one by one. if it is present since birth (congenital), it could be some sort of tumor or even a simple hy chat doctor. that however has fewer possibilities of being associated with pain. if however, redness or pain is present, a condition called torsion of testis may be present wherein the blood supply to a testis is disrupted. the pain and redness could also arise when there is inflammation of the duct of the testis known as the epididymis with or without affecting the testis, a condition called epididymo-orchitis. this could also be caused due to a urinary tract infection or a viral infection like mumps. this might be associated with fever. in some conditions an abscess or a collection of pus might also develop. i think that i have been able to give you an overall idea but if you get back with more details, i could perhaps be more precise. in light of the things i have told you, you might also like a briefing from your doctor on the possibilities he is considering."

"air , a have facial problem . it is diagnosed as hemifacial spasm . is to paralysis ? your treatment with medicine or massage therapy ? els reply to follow . varadharajan a , madurai .",1,24442,"hello varadharajan, bifacial spasm involves involuntary contractions of muscles of one side of face. it usually begins around the eyes and can later involve other muscles supplied by the facial nerve. it's usually seen on one side only, although it can occur on both sides of face. these movements cannot be voluntarily suppressed like in a condition called tics and can continue even in sleep. it is thought to be due to blood vessel pressing on the facial nerve, although it can be due to other causes also. it is not paralysis like you fear. effective treatment is taking botulinum toxin injections or doing microvascular decompression surgery if there is pressure on the facial nerve as earlier mentioned. it is possible to maintain reasonable control over the movements with treatment. hope this helps!"
"air , a have facial problem . it is diagnosed as hemifacial spasm . is to paralysis ? your treatment with medicine or massage therapy ? els reply to follow . varadharajan a , madurai .",2,13983,"hello, i can understand your concern. as you are going for partial parotidectomy, there is a chance that facial nerve can be saved by the surgeon if it is not involved by the tumor. in that case, you will not face any symptoms of facial nerve paralysis. however, if the nerve is involved in the tumor, then it will have to be removed by the surgeon. even if it will not be removed, there is a chance that the tumor may press on the nerve in future and may cause facial nerve paralysis. if the nerve is damaged, you can give it about 6 months to regenerate on its own. sometimes it takes about a year or longer to get the sensation back. in any case, facial massage will sure help to regenerate the nerve faster. you can use ems device after the initial healing of the surgical site (about 3 weeks) and consulting with your surgeon in the follow-up appointment with the surgeon. if the tumor reappears, as that is the case with partial parotidectomy, you may have to go for total parotidectomy in future to remove the entire parotid gland to eliminate the chances of recurrence. i hope this information solves your query. thank you for choosing chat doctor. i wish you recover soon! best,"

hello i had toe fusion 5 months ago and although the swelling has stopped i still get lot of pain and unable to work normally as a builder . i have a sensitive spot under the toe wear if i gets touched it sends a shock through my foot . any suggestions why this is ?,1,13930,"hello, and thank you for your question. fortunately, you probably do not have fibromyalgia. there are several possible causes of pain just in the toe. if there is a pinched nerve in the lower spine, it can cause pain that can be just in one toe. if this is the case, you may find that the pain is worse with change in position, such as lying flat or standing up. pain in the toe, typically the big toe, is common in a disorder called gout, in which the body has too much uric acid. the pain usually lasts a few days at a time, and is usually associated with redness and swelling. pain in the toes can be caused by corns or other skin problems that look small but feel very severe. pins and needles, shooting, on-and-off pains can be caused by irritation to a nerve by diabetes, by lack of vitamins such as b12, or by pressure - similar to the ""foot falling asleep"" feeling we sometimes get if we cross our legs too long. fibromyalgia, on the other hand, is usually a ""pain all over"" problem - back pain, neck pain, arm pain, knee pain, without another cause such as arthritis. it usually does not cause just one part of the body to hurt - most patients say that ""everything hurts"". in my practice, i start with finding out as much as i can from the patient about how the pain feels and how long it has been going on, and if it seems related to anything else. then we examine the foot to look for anything going on with the skin, check if the nerves of the foot are normally sensitive, not as sensitive as usual, or more sensitive, and then we may check blood tests to detect diabetes or vitamin deficiency or other problems as needed. fibromyalgia is diagnosed by obtaining a careful history of where the patient is having pain, other medical problems, and completing a physical exam including what is called a ""painful point"" exam where the doctor pushes at certain places in the body - on the back and near the joints - to see if this causes pain. i hope that my answer to your question is helpful. if you have any further questions, please check back with us. i hope your toe is much better soon."

by friend a grandchild stopped breathing . the hospital said newborns have two flaps in the oesophagus and one of them failed to open where she stopped breathing and lost consciousness . they diagnosed her with acid reflux . they gave her beds and sent her home . is this true or should they get a second opinion ?,1,24704,"that's a terrible tragic thing that happened. hopefully, things will be fine and they'll get the barbarians that did that. your best source of information will be right there in the hospital. the doctors that are attending to her will be doing careful neurological monitoring round the clock....especially, if she's unconscious (hopefully not). often times when the amount of bleeding into the brain is minimal recovery can be virtually complete. however, obviously, i can't give any sort of guarantee on this....everything hinges on the severity of the trauma, whether she is unconscious or not, and what her actual neurological examination is like as time goes on. treatment will likely depend on how much blood is in the brain. sometimes if it causes a lot of pressure then, surgeons will go right away and relieve that pressure by extracting the blood. results are entirely variable due to obvious things that i can't know but all i can say is the younger the injured person in something like this the better the chances for a good recovery. also, the sooner she wakes up...or if she already is awake and breathing on her own for example the better the prognosis. it just really depends on a lot of things. best of luck and i do hope your friend fully recovers, and they get the cowards that did that and put them somewhere where they may enjoy some of the same favors from people of their own persuasion! if you found this response helpful would please assign a rating to the response? many thanks and keep by her side....with your help she's gotta get better, wouldn't you say? :)"

"a have a friend who has syncope ? be always passes out but he blacks out & has seizures . friday he passed out & hit his head , he woke up & passed out again , hitting his head & he was taken to the hospital where they said he had a concussion . be hast woken up since friday & the doctors agent really doing anything . why int he waking up ? is there something they can do ?",1,24462,"i read your query, and i am sorry for your friend. there are two possibilities. the first one is that hitting the head he has had traumatic brain injury. concussion is one type of traumatic brain injury, but if he hasn't regained consciousness at all it must be more serious. to judge the degree and the need for any surgical intervention of course he has to have at least a ct scan, which you don't mention. if he has done it perhaps the damage is not of the sort which benefits from surgery, in that case treatment is only with chat doctor. it depends on results of ct scan though, so i can't be more precise. second possibility is his being in an epileptic status, meaning uninterrupted seizures, in that case treatment is with anti-epileptics and airway protection, at times can be a medication induced coma to stop the seizures and the brain swelling. if he has seizure activity it's easy to identify, but if no seizure activity and ct doesn't explain his non-waking up then a non-convulsive epileptic status needs to be considered which needs an eeg to confirm. anyway, i hope i'm not confusing you even more, i know it's too many hypotheses, but as i said to be more precise at least the ct scan is needed. i hope things will go for the best."

"a felt a soreness in my left shoulder last saturday . a thought it was muscle pain , and on monday a had muscles around the back side of my shoulder twitching . a used an ointment to help the pain ( pain = 3 , but constant ) and took ibuprofen every 4 hours . yesterday my arm was very weak , noticed when a tried to golf and later when a tried to lift a half gallon of milk . a have quit ointment , and taking ibuprofen twice during the day .",1,32397,"hello, based on your information, i would say that this might be tendonitis of the rotator cuff muscles which moves the arm. in other words are overuse of muscle that participates in weight lifting activities. maybe you are doing heavy weights or very intensive exercises. i would like to have more information regarding which movement causes you more pain. is it painful when you lift the arm in front of the side or backward? it might be also biceps tendonitis if the pain is in the front part of the shoulder and pain is worse when you bend the arm against resistance. my initial treatment would be rest from weight lifting activities and switch to other sports such as running for a while. take some ibuprofen. you can use also ultrasound device on physical therapy centers. if after this treatment you are not better i would order a shoulder mri to see deeper the problem. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"a have a fluttering in my upper chest all day yesterday unless a was active usually could tell when a was sitting , today not as bad but still notice it , a had these all my life usually come and go pretty fast but last today it has stayed has me concerned ..",1,83091,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. having your period come late or skip occasionally is common in many women, even when they are not pregnant. most of the time, a delayed period can just be a chance event, but it also can because by stress, changing time zones or traveling, recent weight gain or weight loss. if that is the case, you will usually get it somewhere between 2 and 4 weeks late. a fall usually will not affect your menstrual cycle, unless the stress of your injury was a factor. either way, there is nothing dangerous about missing your period once in a while. if you miss your period for more than 3 months, you should see a gynecologist, so you can be evaluated for hormone imbalanced and the doctor can prescribe appropriate medication to help your period to come. if you are at risk for pregnancy (meaning if you had unprotected sex in the last three weeks), you should repeat the pregnancy test in a week or so just in case. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"i dorian my left butt cheeks has sign of bleeding after suddenly realize by my girlfriend . heres no sign of a lump but there deep bleeding and sign of dryness of the skin . ( very dry ) . a do not feel any pain whatsoever even itchiness as well .. in truly worried what might it be , a cant find the correct explanation for it to be like that , no accidents , didst scratch and etc . thanks so much",1,46870,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. bleeding after sex can occur in women of all ages, but it is not unusual at all when a girl is in her teen years because her own menstrual cycle is still maturing and also chafing inside from sex can occur. furthermore, any bleeding from the uterus can produce cramps, even if it's at the incorrect time. condoms are extremely effective in preventing pregnancy if they were applied before any genital contact and remain on during intercourse and when you pull out. furthermore, the most common sign of pregnancy is a missed menstrual period, so if your girlfriend has not actually missed a cycle she really does not need to worry about pregnancy. if your girlfriend herself is also on birth control pills, irregular bleeding and spotting can be a side effect of the pill as well. so in summary, there are lots of reasons why your girlfriend could be bleeding irregularly, but if you are using proper contraception and condoms, pregnancy is not really one of the things you need to be concerned about. if your girlfriend starts to bleed regularly after sex she really should be evaluated by a doctor, as inflammation or infections of the cervix can cause postcoital (after sex) bleeding as well. i hope that i was adequately able to answer your question today, and that my advice was reassuring. best wishes,"

my girlfriend breaks out with large red areas after showering . always on arms and sometimes on back . the takes very hot showers but always have and this started bout a month ago .,1,57004,"hi going by your history, you have itching and rash involving your face, chest and neck... now there are two possibilities ...either it can be acne lesions(acne corporal meaning pimples of body) or it can be a photosensitive rash. acne vulgarism is a common human skin disease, characterized by areas of skin with seborrhea (scaly red skin), comedones (blackheads and whiteheads), pa pules (pinheads), pustules (pimples), nodules (large pa pules) and possibly scarring. acne affects mostly skin with the densest population of sebaceous follicles; these areas include the face, the upper part of the chest, and the back. some people are sensitive to sunlight; this is known as photosensitivity. photosensitivity may produce a rash, which is known by the general term, photodermatosis. patients may not associate their skin complaint with exposure to light. it is not always the bright summer sun which is responsible; some people also react to sunlight in winter, and very sensitive subjects may even be affected by fluorescent lamps indoors. as in your case, only the exposed sites are involved, so you need to be sure if you have any degree of itching or burning sensation on exposure to sunlight,,,,and as far as doxycycline is concerned,it is a commonly used chat doctor. ....but at the same time this"

"by kidney is swollen and my whole lower back hurts , a have been drinking lots of water and cranberry juice . that else can a do to get better , and does this sound like a kidney infection or something more serious . also a had been drinking lot of soda before this happened",2,34445,"hi, thanks for writing in. the collecting system of the kidney is made of renal calyxes and pelvis. this collects the urine formed in kidney and transports it through the ureter (tubes connecting kidneys and urinary bladder) to the urinary bladder. the pelvicalyceal system is the mouth of the kidney where it connects with the upper end of the ureter. i guess that you have got ultrasound scan done, and it shows mild fullness of the pelvicalyceal system in the left kidney, that is a term applied to increase in diameter of the collecting system in your left kidney. it is not a critical situation, and please do not worry if you do not have any urinary symptoms. since it is mentioned as mild fullness and no kidney stones have been found, therefore(i) it can be that your bladder was completely full at the of ultrasound scan(ii) your kidney pelvicalyceal system is appearing full by itself (extrarenal pelvis) and is an extension of normal appearance.(iii) rarely an infection of urinary system and kidneys (recent or old) can cause such a finding, but this is likely only if you have symptoms like pain in the region of kidney and problems like burning urination or discoloration of urine or any kidney infections in the past.(iv) stones in kidney or ureter can also cause fullness of pelvicalyceal system and since you do not have any stone therefore this does not apply to you. it is important to know if your scan was repeated after passing urine and still there was persistent mild fullness of the pelvicalyceal system on left side. this can also be confirmed by doing an mvp which is injecting a contrast and taking 5 to 6 x-rays to study the functioning of the kidneys in a better way. please consult the urologist."

"two days ago , a started my day with nausea and some abdominal pain . by the end of the day , my abdominal pain was so bad , a was barely able to walk . by stomach hurt to move , and pain would radiate to my sides and back . the next morning , pain was not much , but it would cramp with movement such as bending down . today a felt as if my lower right side of back was a bit swollen . would something be wrong ? ! thanks , laura",1,77239,"hi there. looks like your son with the prior history of pain over the far right side of back and difficulty in standing up has developed a spasm of the back muscle. these muscle spasms need not be always related to what the affected individual was doing at the time of having the onset of pain, but can be related to any abnormal posturing such as bending for a long time prior to the onset of the pain which would have fatigued his back muscles. the pop sound he heard or felt could be probably a disc problem that may lead to a secondary spasm, so if he is having a persisting pain radiating to the right side alone and not subsiding with rest and pain medications, kindly get an mri scan of the spine and get him evaluated. so in the acute setting a few days of bed rest, local analgesic ointment, a 3-day course of tramadol should be enough. in case of pain radiating down the leg or the hip, or any weakness of lower limb on one side, get additional scans and get him checked."

(the amount of platelets in the bloodstream is reduced because the spleen is busy trapping them). so usually people with cirrhosis end up having a problem with portal hypertension and an enlarged spleen, and a reduced platelet count in the bloodstream. as time goes by, the liver may try to repair itself by growing new cells. if there is a lot of scar tissue already present the new cells grow between scar tissue (and result in abnormal nodules). the nodules and scar tissue further interfere with blood flow through the liver. so over time people with advanced cirrhosis can end up having a problem with more and more abnormal nodules and scar tissue forming which interferes even more with blood flow through the liver which makes the spleen continue to enlarge, and the platelet count continue to chat doctor. the splenomegaly is usually not reversible. please go for regular medical follow up. hope this helps"

"i , a feel some tenderness over my left lower rib , there is no pain or anything and today i experienced while breathing a catch sort of feeling . i get palpitations and that confirmed and since a year i am taking beta or 25mg . i done have any shortness of breath , no tiredness ...",1,15046,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. feeling short of breath is not unusual while you're pregnant because the hormones of pregnancy actually have a way of telling your brain to breathe faster. this is to ensure that your baby gets enough oxygen, because as your belly gets bigger your lungs are not able to expand as well. so many women feel the sensation of needing to catch their breath all the time when they breathe when they are in the third trimester. in addition, because you would have been on bed rest for so long, you probably are not in very good cardiovascular shape. another possible reason why you could be feeling short of breath is that there is a possibility that you are anemic. normally, as part of routine prenatal care we check your blood count as well is a test for gestational diabetes somewhere between 24 and 28 weeks. if you've not yet had this test, it might be a good idea to mention your symptoms to your doctor. of course, there can be some serious, dangerous things that can cause shortness of breath; like blood clots that spread to your lung, or fluid in the lungs and other pulmonary problems. if you experience any chest pain or severe shortness of breath or start developing a productive cough, you should notify your doctor immediately and possibly go to the hospital for evaluation. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

(you would need to have a mucus producing cough for 3 myths out of each of the last 2 yrs). symptoms may include productive cough, breathlessness and wheezing. it is diagnosed based on history of smoke exposure and symptoms, physical examination. blood test and imaging studies will need to be done if it is suspected by your doctor. copd is not normally seen in young persons there are other causes of shortness of breath and your doctor will check for these. they include: anemia, asthma, lung infections, heart disease, inflammation of the lung, blockage of the upper airway such as the nose. you need to see you doctor to determine the cause of your symptoms i hope this information is helpful to you"

i a went to the emergency two weeks ago had stress test chest a ray and also they did at scan with and without dye . but could not find anything wrong . and still experiencing chest pain and feeling like sore around my chest and left side of my chest ?,1,44855,"greetings. welcome to chat doctor, and thank you for your question. i understand your concern. your age would help me a lot in constructing a differential diagnosis. however, i will explain some forms of chest pain, which we aim to exclude first, as the main and most dangerous organic causes of it. first, there is angina. angina is a moderate-to-severe chest pain, more characterized like a heaviness or tenderness or ""squeezing"" feeling, localized in the mid-chest, and then radiates to the both sides of the chest, the jaw, left shoulder and left arm. this is the pain originated from one or more blockages within the coronary arteries (arteries that supply the heart muscle with oxygen and nutrients). if this is your case, you should perform an ekg and an echocardiogram, and, depending on these two tests, a cardiac stress test. second, there is sharp, stabbing pain. this kind of pain can come from an enlargement of the root of the aorta and/or from aortic aneurysm. it is severe in intensity, and radiates to the back, between the wings. also, it can be caused by an acute or chronic inflammation to the linings within the rib cage, i.e. the pleura (lining of the lungs) and pericardium (the lining of the heart). this kind of pain - pleuritic pain - is less severe than that caused by aortic aneurysm, and relieves or aggravates from switching positions or the respiratory cycle. if this is the case, then echocardiogram (for pericardium and root of the aorta), chest x-ray (for the pleura and the lungs), and computed tomography of the aorta (in case we suspect that there is a problem with the aorta, higher than its root), should be performed. there is always a possibility of intercostal (between ribs) muscle or pectoral (chest) muscle soreness, and pain originated from problems with ribs and rib joints. if this is the case, you can use over the counter painkillers. i hope i was thorough with my answer. best regards."
i a went to the emergency two weeks ago had stress test chest a ray and also they did at scan with and without dye . but could not find anything wrong . and still experiencing chest pain and feeling like sore around my chest and left side of my chest ?,2,50884,"here you have given symptoms of left chest tightness, pain in left shoulder blade along with lower armpit and biceps. as per your symptoms there are a couple of possibilities. if you have chest congestion and chest discomfort then it can be related to lungs and i suggest taking x-ray and check properly for any sort of lung issue or chest infection. if there is no chest congestion and its only tightness of left side chest then it can also be related to cardiac issue. i suggest visiting cardiologist do your ecg along with treadmill test to evaluate further. if there is no issue at lung and heart level then it is muscular pain only at left shoulder blade which is radiating to left side chest as well as armpit level. but this pain can also be indication of problem at cervical spine like loss of cervical curve or disc related issues. however for this i suggest visiting orthopedic doctor and get yourself evaluated properly and take treatment as per that. here i suggest do visit a physio for further treatment planning as per orthopedic suggestion because physiotherapy treatment will help you to overcome the pain as well physiotherapy exercises will help you to improve the biomechanics of cervical spine, shoulder blade as well shoulder joint which will further help you to have long term relief. you can also use hot pack at home for some more pain relief. and do apply some pain reliving ointment after the use of hot pack. i am sure this will be helpful for you if you use it properly and follow the suggestion. take care."

"i , by 10 years back i had developed a small purplish/blackish small spot which has a small bulge on my lower lip on the rightward side . it is painless even when i touch it or even press it . it seems to have become a little bigger in the last year .. a cant seem to detect the problem . a wonder if its a server ending on the lower lip ? of you could help me it would be great .",1,44715,"hello, i can understand your concern. it would have been helpful if you had mentioned which tooth was treated for root canal. as you are mentioning that the tooth was black and had cracks in it, i am assuming that the tooth is in the lower front region, and you had had some trauma to the lower jaw area which made the tooth dead and also hurt the chin and lip. other possibility is that if the tooth was dead for many years, it may have developed a periapical cyst in relation with the tooth which might be pressing on the mental nerve supplying lower lip and chin and may cause numbness of those areas. alternatively, the numbness may have started after taking local anesthesia in the lower front area for some tooth problem and the injection might have been given deep. in any case, it seems that the nerve supplying sensation to the lower front area of jaw along with lower lip and chin (mental nerve) is damaged. usually, if the nerve is damaged, it can regenerate in 3-6 months and the sensations can return. if you are not sure regarding the crown on the tooth, you can avoid it for some months and take care not to bite hard things with that tooth so that it does not fracture. you can get the crown after the numbness is solved. i would also advise you to visit an oral and maxillofacial surgeon for the examination of the area and regarding numbness. he/she might take an x-ray to rule out presence of periapical lesion or cyst in relation with the tooth. crown should surely be postponed until this possibility is ruled out. i hope this information helps you. thank you for choosing chat doctor. i wish you feel better soon. best,"

about 3 months ago a had a root canal and then a few weeks later a temporary and then finally a crown put on one of my bottom back teeth . there is a little puss pocket at the gum line that bleeds slightly . a was at my dentist last week and he took a new ray . there was nothing on the ray that he was concerned about but said we would keep an eye on the gums . would an ray show if the tooth under the crown is infected ? or is this an issue with my gums ?,1,27649,"hello, i would suggest reducing the bite on the crown as a first step to evaluate if this gives any relief. an older crown may have decay underneath the crown which is not visible on x-ray, but has caused an abscess. a new crown can also have an abscess underneath the crown. treatment options include a root canal. some root fractures are difficult to diagnosis with x-rays. consult a root canal specialist if the tooth already has a root canal, or you want another evaluation and testing of the nerve health. more details involving the crown placement and dental history with x-rays would allow me to give a more detailed response. i suggest a combination of tylenol and advil taken at regular intervals for relief of severe pain. travel can burn the tissue. antibiotics are usually prescribed for infections and can take more than 24 hours to be effective. sometimes a different antibiotic is necessary to treat a resistant infection. are there periodontal conditions to be concerned about? was there an event that made your husband think the crown was cracked? i am glad to assist further and thank you for your inquiry."

hello doc my name is lee in 34 and have some spots on my bottom and its saw and slightly bleeding today i found a supple of lumps the size of a pin head in panicking cos my dad has bowl cancer can it be pasted on to me i no i shoot go to my doc but in inbaristed to do so can you help thank you,1,73387,"hi there! my name is vinay. let me see if i can give you some peace of mind here. mris all depend on magnets! no radiation and they are pretty harmless. the only thing you have to make sure is that you have no implants that could be attracted by the magnet in the machine. when i was in residency in colorado, the duty doc room used to be taken up by my chief and his girlfriend. so i used to sleep in the mri machine!! it was the only flat surface other than the gurneys in the er. so don't worry, the mri is harmless. now the scar tissue at the operative site should not be causing any headaches as its not under pressure and brain tissue can't feel normal sensations like pain. if you are having headaches. look into any problems with the scalp wound or the bone (skull) that they had to go through during the surgery. scar tissue can hypertrophy (grow in size) over time, but its really rare and really, really slow. so the mris will catch it if it does. not to worry there. so relax, the scar tissue is harmless and so is the mri. make sure you get those scans done just as the doctors tell you too! congratulations on beating back the gbm! i wish you the best of luck!"

"from : anonymous ( kindly done mention my name in your reply , thanks ) hi doctors i am 37 yrs old with very regular menstrual cycle of 26-28 days . me & my of had an unprotected sex yesterday afternoon . the first day of my last period was last may 7 and yesterday was my 13th day , in fertile right ? i took 4 white tablets of corvette pill ( its a 21 pill corvette ) yesterday at 6pm and took again at 6am 4 tablets after 12hrs . question : will the chances of being pregnant high ? or will corvette pill prevent it ? when do i expect withdrawal bleeding ? is this means that in not pregnant ? how will i be so sure ? when do i expect my next period ? please help . thanks .",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

i my friend just had a hysterectomy or however you spell it . it has been about 2 weeks now and they put her on beds for an infection but it is not getting better she has been on beds for over 10 days now and the other day she caught and this orange creamy stuff ran down her leg,1,46193,"hallow dear, precum is pre-ejaculation secretion which is expelled out unknowingly. it does contain some sperms which can cause pregnancy. however, you had this experience 4 days after her period. this day is rather safe as far as the risk of pregnancy is considered. egg is released 14 days prior to next expected menses. egg has a life of 24 hours while sperms are active for 3 days. hence, a period of about a week around the day of egg release is considered as fertile window. 4 days after the menses falls quite away from fertile window. still, i would say, better to err on safer side. hence, she should take post-coital emergency contraceptive pill protection. these pills have to be taken within 72 hours after the unprotected sex. if this period is already over, she may get intrauterine contraceptive device inserted within 5 days of this unprotected sex. this will give her protection from the pregnancy and moreover will give her ongoing contraception for years to come. if 5 days also are over, you cannot do anything now. just wait for her periods to appear (which mostly she will get). if she misses her period, get pregnancy test done on her urine after one week; earlier the results may be false negative. alternatively, you may get her blood checked for beta chat doctor for diagnosing pregnancy, 10 days after this incidence. if she is pregnant, she can get the pregnancy terminated by medicines safely and effectively up to 9 weeks of gestation. however, this has to be done with gynecologists advice and prescription only. and lastly, any step she takes is to be done with her parents consent since she is minor; otherwise it will be an illegal offense. i hope this provides you detailed guidelines."

i am a care giver and my clients cat bit her leg at 330 am . she takes warfarin . when i got there at 1pm her leg was bleeding a little and oozing a clear liquid . that clear liquid is still coming out . should we be concerned ? she put factor ban on the wounds,2,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"a am currently trying to have a baby , but its seems that a cant . a did the ovulation calendar for my period and had sex the day that it said a would be fertile . a also had sex the day after my period and the week before the next one . a started this jan. 25 and its now feb.24 . my period came on on the 21 of feb. what should a do",1,10728,"hallow dear, the egg is released (ovulation) 14 days prior to next expected menses. considering that egg has life of 24 hours and sperms are active for 72 hours, a period of about 8 days is fertile period. you had period on 22 january, hence your next period would be on 21 feb. (considering your period of 30 days). so the ovulation day falls on 8 feb. thus the fertile period would be from 3 february till 11 feb. if your period is different from 30 days, please add or subtract those many days in this calculation. according to your calculation, the fertile period starts on 2 feb. so the chances of pregnancy due to intercourse on 31 jan. are remote, though cannot be completely excluded, since variation by couple of days has to be expected. it is too close to the fertile period. though there was no ejaculation, you cannot exclude pre-ejaculation fluid passage which happens unknowingly. it does contain some sperms which are capable of fertilizing an ovum. so though the maximum chances of conception are due to sex on 2 feb., for legal purpose, you may opt for dna test to ascertain the paternity. i hope this helps you."

yes thankyou a went to dentist yesterday and he noticed what he thought was a broken blood vessel on toward the back of my mouth the roof he said if it does not clear up within . a week he wants to send me to a oral surgeon how do a know if it is a broken blood vessel,1,95688,"hello, im very sorry to hear about your friends stroke. here is some information relation to hemorrhagic strokes (brain bleeds).first, brain bleeds can happen for different reasons such as a head injury (traumatic), a rupture of an aneurysm and bleed within the brain matter itself (parenchymal hemorrhage). it is very important in your friends' case to determine what caused his bleed. given his fevers any infections need to be ruled out and an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) should be done to rule out any sort of infection of the heart valves which could send bacteria to the brain which could result in a bleed. he absolutely needs to have blood vessel imaging in the form of either a ct angiogram and mr angiogram to make sure that there are no abnormal collections of blood vessels in the brain and aneurysms that could have cause the bleed. also, when there is a bleed in the brain a tumor must also be ruled out. all that being said, the most common cause of a bleed in the brain is due to high blood pressure which causes weakening of blood vessels and can result in a hemorrhage. most commonly management of brain hemorrhages is supportive, meaning that the only things that are done is blood pressure control, pain management and if the person is unconscious then support for breathing. if the bleed is very large then surgical intervention may be necessary. what the doctors are saying as that they want to repeat a ct scan to see if the bleed has become larger, which can sometimes happen. there are several risk factors for the bleed worsening: one is poor blood pressure control, another is if there is an underlying aneurysm or blood vessel that could bleed. that's why it is so important to determine what caused the bleed. for small bleeds with no underlying vascular or malignant pathology the outcome is typically fairly good. the blood causes irritation and pressure on the surrounding brain causing weakness and neurological symptoms, but as the blood subsides the symptoms improve and sometimes there may be a remarkable improvement. the language area of the brain is very delicate, and it is hard to predict how well he will recover, but my best educated guess is that he will recover at least some language function and could even recover close to how he was though probably never quite back to level his language was before the bleed. it sounds like he is doing relatively well overall since he is able to go to the restroom without support, so that is an encouraging sign. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"i , a have a small lump that has appeared on some scar tissue on the front of my head . when i press it it seems to cause a tingling sensation in my nose ! ave had a bad flu and pneumonia over the last month but am feeling better now . the lump feels very hard and is growing .",2,33931,"hi michele jacobi the first thing that has to be done once you find a lump in the region of the chest wall is to confirm what it is. in your case a biopsy has already been done and let us await its result. you're understanding that cancerous lumps don't bleed after biopsy is correct. but i think your presumption that if it was scar tissue it would have bled is not correct. scar tissue also need not bleed. needle biopsies do not usually cause any bleeding unless a blood vessel is ruptured during the procedure since how long have you noticed this lump. is the size of the lump increasing ? if the biopsy comes as positive for cancer then you will have to undergo a series of investigation to find out he the extent of the disease. ? whether it is confined to the chest wall only or whether it has gone beyond the chest wall to other regions. treatment decision will depend on the results of this if the biopsy comes as negative for cancer then there are 2 options 1- if your physician thinks it is insignificant then you need to follow it up. just keep a check on your lump to see whether it is increasing in size and also get it checked by your physician regularly2- the second option (and my preference) is to do an open biopsy especially if the lump was detected recently and is increasing in size and also if the lump is firm to hard (and not very soft). the reason is needle biopsy can be negative, but this does not always mean there is no cancer especially if the tissue sample taken is not adequate. also time factor is important. you may lose time keeping the lump under follow up to see whether it is increasing in size hope you are satisfied with my reply. anyway don't worry. follow your doctors' advice chat doctor."

"is of late , my husband ( 42yrs ) has had several episodes of nausea , cold sweats and stomach pain in the morning when he first gets up . be has had issues with acid foods and beverage on an empty stomach but now the symptoms are coming on without having anything in his stomach at all . be had a bout of tick fever 18 mos ago , is under more stress than usual . a am wondering if this is ulcer or heart related or something entirely different . an you give me some suggestions ? a am planning a physical with our or . thank you .",1,64589,"greetings. welcome to chat doctor, and thank you for your question. i understand your concern. clearly, you were preoccupied by this new event or sensation you were experiencing. in various stressful situations, both physical or psychological, heart rate and blood pressure are parameters that increase. your age is not very consistent with a coronary artery origin of this pain (i.e. a blockage within the coronary arteries - arteries that encompass the heart as a crown, hence the name, and supply the heart muscle with oxygen and important nutrients). however, angina is more like a squeezing or heaviness felt in the mid-chest which radiates to the throat and jay, and left shoulder and left arm, starts on exertion, is not related to the food intake, and is relieved when the exercise is ceased. i am assuming you are an active and healthy 27-year-old, so this kind of pain would be sensed by you during moderate physical activity. there are other origins of this kind of chest pain. and if it is food-related, then the highest probability is that it has a digestive tract origin. i would recommend you a consult with a gastrohepatologist (digestive tract and liver specialist) to further examine whether this pain is coming from a possible esophageal spasm (the tube that connects the pharynx with the stomach) or it is coming from an abnormal process in the stomach or the early part of the small intestine. an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy may be required for properly assessing these issues. i hope i was of help with my answer. kind regards,"

"3 my noncalcified pulmonary nodule in the right middle lobe was found on a ctscan last month . wondered if a should be concerned . just went through removal of right kidney due to renal well carcinoma . scheduled for surgery for hyper-parathyroid may 19 , 2014 .",1,93981,"hi, thanks for writing in. cancer is a difficult condition to treat and treatment depends on the progress of disease. it is possible that you had a cancer involving right lobe of thyroid and there was also retrosternal extension. as the cancer was detected in the nodule from right lobe, you doctor was right in taking out the entire thyroid and the part of thyroid gland projecting in to the sternum. retro sternum thyroid is the presence of thyroid tissue behind the sternum and this is seen in few people. finding of this requires it to be removed when there is a cancer. there are aggressive cancers that require chemotherapy and radiation after surgery. your doctor will discuss this with you if it is indicated. after thyroid surgery you might also have to follow up with your doctor regularly to know if there is any more cancer activity in the thyroid region or anywhere else that needs attention and treatment. please do not worry."

"i am sixteen years old and do not smoke , but i have lived with the effects of secondhand smoke almost my whole life . i weigh between 110 -- 112 pounds and am about five foot to five foot one . i also have slight active asthma due to my history with secondhand smoke",1,10977,"hello, it's been 4 years that you have been diagnosed with asthma, for which you taking meds already, we need to consider few points first:as you know that asthma needs a trigger, which could be anything for example smoke, pollen, hay, animal fur, dust etc. when exposed to these it triggers a bronchospasm and an asthmatic attack occurs. so, as you said your partner smokes though not in front of you or around you, but he does smoke, that smoke is still present in his breath, his clothes and body and it's enough to trigger an attack anytime. i hope you both are aware about the ill effects of passive smoking, they are almost equivalent to active smoking. i would advise requesting your partner to think about quitting smoke because it's harmful for you and obviously for him in the long run. the medications that you take will also have a slower effect if smoking continues. i would also suggest you to book an appointment with your treating doctor and review your current medications maybe he/she might want to alter some to help you for a better control. i would also request you to keep a check of your peak flow which is basically the maximum air that you breathe out in one breath and accordingly modify your inhaler doses. you should also indulge in some physical activities like brisk walking or jogging which will help maintain a good lung capacity, ask your doctor about breathing exercises, they also help in maintaining a good lung function. prevention is always better than cure, so you both should meet your doctor and help your partner quit smoking which is beneficial for both. asthma can be a very debilitating illness and you both are young, so you can check it at an early stage and keep good health. if you have further queries you can get back to me, am always here to help. take care keep healthy."
