"this is with regards to my elder brother who has been suffering from chronic pancreatitis since last 20 years.recently he had lost 10 pkg in 4 months so doc advised him to do ca-19.9 ( cancer antigen 19.9 ) , serum by cmia . the report showed 21.83 which was less than normal range 37 u/ml . but in the month of kept 2013 the report had showed 9 . since it has increased now is it dangerous or any chances of getting pancreatic cancer.pls advice .",1,76249,"hi, thanks for writing in. the normal range of ca 19-9 in the blood of a healthy individual is 0-37 u/ml (units per milliliter). ca 19-9 associated antigen levels are elevated in many patients with pancreatic cancer. however not all patients with cancer in the pancreas and gall bladder region will have elevated ca19-9 level elevated. since your mother has confirmed gall bladder cancer with multiple lymph node enlargement in the stomach, it is important to treat her on grounds of cancer and provide complete treatment and pain relief. many patients will not develop symptoms of cancer in the early stages even when there is lymph node enlargement. there is probably no pressure on the normal structures like cystic duct and bile ducts due to the cancer, and therefore she is not having major symptoms, however the liver function abnormalities can be due to lymph nodes causing pressure on the bile duct. it is important to test the lymph nodes for cancer if it has not been done and if confirmed to be cancer then start treatment. please do not worry."

testicle pain my husband is 37 and has diabetes . he has been having pain in his festivals and at the base of his penis . his blood sugar is under control with beds and he just started taking norton for neuropathy . this pain has become worse over the last few months . any sexual activity is difficult and doesn't ease the pain for long . he has had angiokeratoma of force for many yrs . what could be the cause of this ?,1,16588,"i am sorry to hear about this behavior i can understand it must be distressing to you and your daughters. it is important to assess whether he was in the right frame of mind when this behavior occurred. adhd is usually not the cause for this. possibly he may have been in low blood glucose (hypoglycemia) or high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) wherein his consciousness and judgment may have been clouded and hence he exhibited this disinhibited act, but there is no definitive explanation for this. regarding the adhd he must visit a professional psychiatrist or counselor and gauge how to maintain his focus and attention. in regard to the diabetes you must have a regular follow up with the endocrinologist and see whether his blood sugar has been controlled and whether he has ever had other times of altered judgment. if the behavior is absolutely unrelated to the diabetes, then you have even greater reason to visit a mental health professional to look into this. please feel free to connect with us anytime for further queries."

a just used the restroom and passed a white glob it had no blood or anything it was completely white .. i am 34 weeks and 3 days pregnant and was wondering if this was my mucus plug ... also me and my boyfriend just had intercourse could it be sperm that came back out ?,1,96183,"i'm female 22 yrs and i also have really dark circles under my eyes. i tried all the creams and gels at pharmacies and none of them worked. i was diagnosed with vitamin b12 deficiency which causes dark under eye circles. it took me years to get a diagnosis because physicians don't generally test b12 levels especially if your cbc counts are normal. i had lots of routine blood work done, and they all came back normal. a few months ago i was experiencing severe tingling (i had other symptoms too, but the tingling was most bothersome) so i told my new doctor to test me for absolutely everything that can cause it. my b12 level came back at 30 which is extremely low. the funny thing about it was that i took b12 vitamins all the time... so my body just wasn't absorbing them. you should also consider getting tested for celiac disease - if you have symptoms associated with it - because it deprives your body of important vitamins. i'm sure there are products or something out there that helps dark circles, but it won't help if you have an underlying condition."
a just used the restroom and passed a white glob it had no blood or anything it was completely white .. i am 34 weeks and 3 days pregnant and was wondering if this was my mucus plug ... also me and my boyfriend just had intercourse could it be sperm that came back out ?,2,77227,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, i want to clarify, if you are virgin and have not had sexual intercourse or ejaculation directly in the opening of your vagina, your chance of pregnancy is really nonexistent. sperm die when exposed to air, so there is no way that you can become pregnant from sperm that ejaculated outside the vagina. furthermore, is very uncommon to find women who ovulate during their menstrual cycle. therefore, you were most likely not at the fertile time of your cycle when you and your boyfriend had genital contact. furthermore, irregular bleeding can be caused by travel, changes in weight, hormonal imbalances and stress, especially the stress of worrying about getting pregnant. just because your period was light this month does not mean that there was anything wrong. now omens menstrual cycle is exactly the same every month, and as long as you got a period at the usual time, there is no reason to suspect pregnancy if the bleeding was different in quality than what you usually see. so i think that it is fine to be reassured that you did not conceive from this encounter with your boyfriend. if you continue to have irregular menstrual cycles for more than three months, you may want to visit your local physician as some hormonal imbalances can cause these problems and should be tested for. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was reassuring. best wishes,"

: i just had sex with my of she just ended her mensuration the day before and that time i used a condom by that broke out and soon i gave her a pill and the next day onward she started having mensuration again as it was over for this mont .. what is causing this,1,46193,"hallow dear, precum is pre-ejaculation secretion which is expelled out unknowingly. it does contain some sperms which can cause pregnancy. however, you had this experience 4 days after her period. this day is rather safe as far as the risk of pregnancy is considered. egg is released 14 days prior to next expected menses. egg has a life of 24 hours while sperms are active for 3 days. hence, a period of about a week around the day of egg release is considered as fertile window. 4 days after the menses falls quite away from fertile window. still, i would say, better to err on safer side. hence, she should take post-coital emergency contraceptive pill protection. these pills have to be taken within 72 hours after the unprotected sex. if this period is already over, she may get intrauterine contraceptive device inserted within 5 days of this unprotected sex. this will give her protection from the pregnancy and moreover will give her ongoing contraception for years to come. if 5 days also are over, you cannot do anything now. just wait for her periods to appear (which mostly she will get). if she misses her period, get pregnancy test done on her urine after one week; earlier the results may be false negative. alternatively, you may get her blood checked for beta chat doctor for diagnosing pregnancy, 10 days after this incidence. if she is pregnant, she can get the pregnancy terminated by medicines safely and effectively up to 9 weeks of gestation. however, this has to be done with gynecologists advice and prescription only. and lastly, any step she takes is to be done with her parents consent since she is minor; otherwise it will be an illegal offense. i hope this provides you detailed guidelines."

a was playing w/my dog & she bit me - not seriously . just enough to cause slight bleeding . a was blotting the bleed when it was about done clear fluid started coming out . a have congenital lymphedema & this has never happened before . a am 59 . that is your advice ? thank you .,1,11055,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. it is very common to have breakthrough bleeding, which is bleeding when you are not supposed to have your period, when you miss a birth control pill. the pill is out of your system within 24 hours which is like day 2 of your pill-free week, so some women will start to have a mini-period then. you may bleed at the end of the pack, but if you don't, you should do a pregnancy test because missing two pills, even if you back them up, can trigger ovulation. so you don't need to worry about the bleeding, because that is just a side effect of missing pills. this should not continue to happen when you remember to take the pill every day. keeping the pill with you at all times (like in your purse, instead of at home, so you have access to it wherever you go) can help avoid missing pills. there are also internet programs and apps you can use as a reminder to take your pill. i hope this information was reassuring, and i was able to adequately answer your question, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"a work in an adult store , and a was working with some electrical equipment . a was giving an example with the equipment on my arm , and my arm is really sore today . should a be worried or will this go away soon ? a have used electricity before , but never had pain after ?",1,31327,"greetings. thank you for your question and welcome to chat doctor. i understand your concern. if this pain did not go away with your antibiotic therapy then probably it was not a sore throat. angina, pain originated by a blockage in your coronary arteries (arteries that encompass the heart as a crown, and ""feed"" it with oxygen and nutrients), usually manifests as a mid-chest pain radiating to the throat and left arm or shoulder. however, sometimes it can have atypical forms of manifesting and, since you have this sensation during carrying out physical activity, such as climbing stairs, my opinion is that you should have a cardiac check-up to, at least, exclude the cardiac origin of this pain. this is what i recommend you to do. first, to consult a cardiologist and have an ekg and an echocardiogram, to assess your heart electrical system and conduction system, and also assess the motility and function of heart chambers and valves. if seen appropriate, proceed further with a cardiac stress test, do more sensitively and specifically depict any problem in your coronary arteries. with your symptom, if the latter test comes back positive or inconclusive, then a coronary angiogram is appropriate, to assess if there are blockages in your coronary arteries and, if there are, to be treated as recommended. i hope i was helpful. take care and good luck. best regards,"

"hello , a am a grandma of an 8 month old girl.she weighed 6lbs 6 ops when born last may.she is now 8 months and weighs 14lbs 8 ozs.she is happy and healthy , but never seems to be interested in food or milk.my daughter breast feed until 6 months , but because she want gaining well she decided to switch to formula.she has been getting cereal , vegetables and fruit for about 3 months now , but every meal is a struggle for my daughter and at the most she will only eat a couple of tablespoons of cereal or an ice cube size portion of vegetable or fruit . the most she will take at a bottle feeding is 5 to 6 ounces , but most times this is much less , around 3 or 4 ounces . by daughter sees other friends that have younger babies and how much they eat and is worried.do you have ant advice ?",1,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

hello sir my daughter is 1yr old ( 10kg ) having fever from past 8 hrs she a having sound in breathing like god god ... a be given cronin 2 times a her stool is green in color a some watery sound hearing from stomach .... a don to know what to do .actually we a in travelling from last 4 days in the train.so a request a to ply advice,1,14427,"hey there, thank you for your question and welcome to chat doctor. first off, why is your daughter having difficulty breathing? is it due to the nasal congestion or because her tonsils are enlarged? the sound that she makes while sleeping could be due to the stuffy nose. she is having to compensate for air so she's mouth breathing. you are probably also hearing chest congestion if she has a cold. if you hear a high pitch whistle sound called wheezing, then i would recommend a visit back to the doctor to make sure her airway isn't being affected by her swollen tonsils. the medications that you listed are exactly what i would want to see given to her. strep throat is treated with antibiotics and that is what the literal is for. remember, with any antibiotics, it will take 2-3 days before her symptoms start to resolve. the fever, sore throat and ulcers will usually still be present during the first 24-36 hours. the two other medications you listed are to make her comfortable in terms of her nasal congestion and other cold symptoms. i would have to agree with the doctor who prescribed the medications and say that it is a good treatment plan. hopefully your little one will start to feel better quickly. have a good day!"

"had a small filling on lower front tooth to the right done last thursday . in leaving the clinic , a felt a lot of pain in my chin area for about 1 hour followed by a lump the size of a 10 pence coin which was initially relish . the lump hurt on touch . sent back to dentist the same day and he thought it could be anaesthetic trapped in the area and told me to massage it . a still have the lump 3 days later but its more elongated. , less hard and less painful on massage touch .",1,44715,"hello, i can understand your concern. it would have been helpful if you had mentioned which tooth was treated for root canal. as you are mentioning that the tooth was black and had cracks in it, i am assuming that the tooth is in the lower front region, and you had had some trauma to the lower jaw area which made the tooth dead and also hurt the chin and lip. other possibility is that if the tooth was dead for many years, it may have developed a periapical cyst in relation with the tooth which might be pressing on the mental nerve supplying lower lip and chin and may cause numbness of those areas. alternatively, the numbness may have started after taking local anesthesia in the lower front area for some tooth problem and the injection might have been given deep. in any case, it seems that the nerve supplying sensation to the lower front area of jaw along with lower lip and chin (mental nerve) is damaged. usually, if the nerve is damaged, it can regenerate in 3-6 months and the sensations can return. if you are not sure regarding the crown on the tooth, you can avoid it for some months and take care not to bite hard things with that tooth so that it does not fracture. you can get the crown after the numbness is solved. i would also advise you to visit an oral and maxillofacial surgeon for the examination of the area and regarding numbness. he/she might take an x-ray to rule out presence of periapical lesion or cyst in relation with the tooth. crown should surely be postponed until this possibility is ruled out. i hope this information helps you. thank you for choosing chat doctor. i wish you feel better soon. best,"

"a had my iud in for about a month . the first few days was slight spotting , a cramps for one day . now , a month later , a am experiencing very sore nipples although my boobs in general seem fine . a have not had a period yet , but normally , a do not experience any symptoms when my period is about to come .",1,8772,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the proper way to use the nearing is to put it in, leave it in for 3 weeks, take it out, wait one week, and replace it. during the week you are not wearing the ring, you should have some bleeding that is considered a menstrual cycle. if you wore the ring continuously for two months and then had a new one replaced but only removed it 3 days later, the pinkish spotting was your ""period"", which is caused by not wearing the ring. the bleeding was very light because you had suppressed it by continuously wearing the ring for over 2 months. so you should expect your next period about 4-5 weeks after the episode of spotting that you had. if you do not have menses by then, i recommend repeating the pregnancy test at that time. if you did not have regular monthly cycles before you used the ring, your cycle will follow your regular pattern that you typically have when not using hormonal contraception. if you are trying to get pregnant, you should have intercourse about every other day and begin taking prenatal vitamins as it benefits the health of the baby for the vitamins to be present at conception. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"hello doctor , a am having severe pain in my lower stomach . initially the doctors suggested that it could be due to acidity . however when the pain got severe , i was asked to take a scan . the scan report suggest that , i have left wild hydroureteronephrosis . a am not sure of the technical word . is this something to worry . is it related to kidney stone . of yes , can the same be cured by tablets itself . now long would it take for me get back to normal . guess i am asking too many questions , reason being i am worried .",1,58987,"his am chat doctor. i have read your message. i think i can help you. first, a package test means that multiple tests are included that correlate to the test. cpk and spe can both be package tests as there are many related tests needed in a diagnosis. the symptoms that you seem to be facing as per the query is basically severe backache that increases on lying down or bending-in other words, anything that causes the spine to be under pressure. now she itself can cause the symptoms. the muscles and bone problems can arise in she itself and thus possibly one will feel that there is nothing more to do. however, in many situations, the doctors may get biased my a diagnosis. so, i think it is good that your doctor did not get biased with your pre-existing diagnosis of she and continued to look for other causes of backache. a severe backache can happen due to muscle disorders, a condition known as myopathy. the cause of myopathy may be she itself. the test commonly done to test myopathy is cpk or creatine phospholipase. this is a test done from blood. the idea is if the cpk is raised, it suggests myopathy. in this situation, your doctor will need to modify the therapy. i am unaware of your medication from the query. so i cannot really comment upon it. but some medicines themselves cause myopathy. and sometimes, the dose of existing medicines need to be stepped up for treatment of myopathy. so i presume your doctor wanted to check that. second test was spe or serum protein electrophoresis. this is one of the tests for multiple myeloma. this is a type of malignancy that affects the bones and causes bone pains and should be ruled out in middle-aged to elderly commonly if the backache is worsening and is specially bad when lying down. if the test is negative, there is nothing to worry about. if it does come out to be positive, multiple myeloma can be treated. so again you need not worry since the treatment is available. why the doctor did not tell you about the tests is something i can only speculate about. i guess it was because these are just doubts, considering you already have she- in medicine, the usual dictum is that one disease can explain the symptom, the other condition should not be sought. having said that, it's a folly to miss another diagnosis due to a pre-existing condition. i think he would have told you if the tests came out positive. so there should be nothing to worry about-the doctor was just making sure that there is no other problem. possibly since there was nothing else diagnosed, he did not tell you about it. i have tried to make it as simple as possible to understand the situation. in case there are still doubts, feel free to contact me for further details. best of luck,"

(considering your period of 30 days). so the ovulation day falls on 8 feb. thus the fertile period would be from 3 february till 11 feb. if your period is different from 30 days, please add or subtract those many days in this calculation. according to your calculation, the fertile period starts on 2 feb. so the chances of pregnancy due to intercourse on 31 jan. are remote, though cannot be completely excluded, since variation by couple of days has to be expected. it is too close to the fertile period. though there was no ejaculation, you cannot exclude pre-ejaculation fluid passage which happens unknowingly. it does contain some sperms which are capable of fertilizing an ovum. so though the maximum chances of conception are due to sex on 2 feb., for legal purpose, you may opt for dna test to ascertain the paternity. i hope this helps you."

a took the morning after pill levonelle 18 hours after my partner and a had sex when the condom burst . be said he did to ejaculate however it was better that i took the pill after it happened to be on the safe side . a took the pill on monday and have had no side affects or anything since taking it . 10 days before sleeping with my partner i had my period . is there still a risk that i can still get pregnant even after taking the morning after pill . help on this matter would be appreciated .,1,1599,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the morning after pill is 90 percent effective if taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse. so, regardless of what happened with your pill taking before your pill-free week, the morning-after pill should still be effective. many women have a delayed period after taking the morning-after pill as a side effect, but the possibility of pregnancy still exists if you are late, so you should perform a urine pregnancy test just in case. if it has not been 2 weeks yet since your unprotected encounter, it may be too early to have a positive pregnancy test, so i would repeat it in a week if that is the case. in addition, many women have an irregular period or skip entirely after they stop the pill. if you are not pregnant, you can start a new pack of pills as soon as you get them, but just use a condom as a backup for the first two weeks. you should get a period in the pill-free week as you did previously. i hope i was able to answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"yes my sister has a lump coming out of the bottom of her vagina , says it does not pain , but very windy , goes to toilet and passes water a lot . her left groin is also swollen , she measured the size of the lump 6cm long . not sure if this correct . can you help .",1,33931,"hi michele jacobi the first thing that has to be done once you find a lump in the region of the chest wall is to confirm what it is. in your case a biopsy has already been done and let us await its result. you're understanding that cancerous lumps don't bleed after biopsy is correct. but i think your presumption that if it was scar tissue it would have bled is not correct. scar tissue also need not bleed. needle biopsies do not usually cause any bleeding unless a blood vessel is ruptured during the procedure since how long have you noticed this lump. is the size of the lump increasing ? if the biopsy comes as positive for cancer then you will have to undergo a series of investigation to find out he the extent of the disease. ? whether it is confined to the chest wall only or whether it has gone beyond the chest wall to other regions. treatment decision will depend on the results of this if the biopsy comes as negative for cancer then there are 2 options 1- if your physician thinks it is insignificant then you need to follow it up. just keep a check on your lump to see whether it is increasing in size and also get it checked by your physician regularly2- the second option (and my preference) is to do an open biopsy especially if the lump was detected recently and is increasing in size and also if the lump is firm to hard (and not very soft). the reason is needle biopsy can be negative, but this does not always mean there is no cancer especially if the tissue sample taken is not adequate. also time factor is important. you may lose time keeping the lump under follow up to see whether it is increasing in size hope you are satisfied with my reply. anyway don't worry. follow your doctors' advice chat doctor."

"by boyfriend had a little sperm on his penis before we put the condom on . is soon as we started having sex the condom broke , we didst realize for about a minute . he did not ejaculate . that are the chances of me getting pregnant from the little sperm that was on him ?",1,37527,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. even though your boyfriends penis was inside you for only a short time, sperm can be present in pre-ejaculate (or pre-cum) and if you truly do not want to become pregnant it is really important to avoid any contact of the penis with your vagina during sexual play. the most fertile time of a woman cycle is in the middle, typically 14 days before your menstrual period would be due. so the time from when your period finishes until you start to feel pms symptoms is your fertile time. so in this case, since your boyfriend did not ejaculate, it still would be quite rare for you to have conceived. the most common sign of pregnancy is a late or delayed menstrual period. so in your case, you just need to wait for your period to arrive, and if it is late, you can do an over-the-counter urine pregnancy test which is greater than 99% accurate. pregnancy test do not become positive however until at least 2 to 3 weeks after conception. so in summary, your chances of having gotten pregnant in your particular situation is very, very low. for the future, please make sure that the penis is completely covered with a condom if it has any contact with the opening of your vagina. as long as the area is moist, sperm can swim all the way up your vagina from the opening and result in pregnancy. however, the amount of sperm in pre-cum is extremely low, so again i doubt that you need to be concerned about this one sexual encounter. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was helpful. best wishes,"

"i a have pain in the knee area . walking is fine but using the stairs is hard . which doctor should i see ? i had bursitis ( spelling ? ) in the hip area a few years ago and it was treated with physical therapy and sleeve with good progress . occasionally a experienced lower back pain , not to the point that its very painful . usually goes away after taking sleeve .",1,44715,"hello, i can understand your concern. it would have been helpful if you had mentioned which tooth was treated for root canal. as you are mentioning that the tooth was black and had cracks in it, i am assuming that the tooth is in the lower front region, and you had had some trauma to the lower jaw area which made the tooth dead and also hurt the chin and lip. other possibility is that if the tooth was dead for many years, it may have developed a periapical cyst in relation with the tooth which might be pressing on the mental nerve supplying lower lip and chin and may cause numbness of those areas. alternatively, the numbness may have started after taking local anesthesia in the lower front area for some tooth problem and the injection might have been given deep. in any case, it seems that the nerve supplying sensation to the lower front area of jaw along with lower lip and chin (mental nerve) is damaged. usually, if the nerve is damaged, it can regenerate in 3-6 months and the sensations can return. if you are not sure regarding the crown on the tooth, you can avoid it for some months and take care not to bite hard things with that tooth so that it does not fracture. you can get the crown after the numbness is solved. i would also advise you to visit an oral and maxillofacial surgeon for the examination of the area and regarding numbness. he/she might take an x-ray to rule out presence of periapical lesion or cyst in relation with the tooth. crown should surely be postponed until this possibility is ruled out. i hope this information helps you. thank you for choosing chat doctor. i wish you feel better soon. best,"

hello doctor .. i am 32 years old .. single and working .. a am having an irregular heartbeat problem since the past 10 years .. it comes and goes once in a while but when it comes it stays for 1 - 2 week . its very discomforting as a feel like my heart is finding it hard to pump .. its like heart beats 5times and the 6th times it slows down and the 7th beat is fast which also gives me headache .. i feel tired due to this problem .. i done feel this when i am actively working but i get this strongly when i am resting/lying down or just seated doing light work ... its also strong after taking my meals .. i am anaemic and i have anxiety too .. but i done get panic or anxiety attacks .. never took treatment for anxiety before .. kindly advice me on what could be the possible reason for this and what should i do about it ? thank you .,1,25338,"hello and thank you for using chat doctor. i carefully read your question and understand your concern. but you should not worry, its nothing serious. as you describe, my opinion is that it might be a rhythm issue. someone can feel strong and fast heart beats for different reasons. it may be a simple sinus tachycardia. this means that the heart is beating faster than 100 beats for minute. its normal range in a resting condition is between 60-100 beats for minute. when it goes up you may feel a strong heart beat in your chest and a sensation like your body is beating too. another reason for this sensation might be what we call an ekstrasystol.these is electrical heart impulses that generates in some parts of heart different from normal sinus rhythm. this generates an escaped beat that the person feels like jumping ore bumping. it gives the sensation like a beat is skipping, may experience palpitations or an anxiety sensation that your daughter explains like trembling. this extrasistoles may happen from different reasons from simple emotional stress to other pathologies like anemia, hyperthyroidism etc. so, my opinion as cardiologist is that you have nothing to worry. it is just a simple episode, and it is quite normal in younger ages. only if these symptoms persist and begins to interfere the daily live, if i was your treating doctor i will recommend some examinations like a blood analysis to exclude anemia, the thyroid hormones, an electrocardiogram, echocardiography and of course a holder monitoring. this will help us to document and see what happens with heart rhythm. at meantime, i will recommend your daughter to avoid coffee, caffeine products because they rise heart frequency and extrasistolic beats. i encourage her to have physical training because sometimes it helps in reducing extrasistoles, tachycardia, even making them disappear. wish i was helpful. take good care. best regards"

fractured ( spiral ) my fifth metatarsal 5 weeks ago . in an air cast . to weight regimen . that does a healing fracture feel like ? a never had a break before and a am paranoid to make it worse . sometimes a get a slight burning sensation or a general shyness .,1,43817,hi. any fracture requires a minimum period of 5 weeks to heal. if fractured bone is actively aiding in walking or weight-bearing then chance of displacement of fractured fragment are high on weight-bearing and can cause delay in fracture healing. in your scenario-it looks like you have an displaced fracture of 5th metatarsal that is the reason they applied a walking boot. if you start bearing weight so early then chance of displacement of fracture fragment is high which can cause delay in healing or nonunion (fracture not healing/ joining). things to do-1)i would suggest you to continue walking cast for at least 3-4 weeks.2)take pan killer if required.3) do not bear weight unless advised by an orthopeadician.4) take serriopeptidase twice daily to reduce swelling.5)keep limb elevate over pillow to reduce swelling of the limb.

"hello , in trying to get pregnant and i have been trying for basically 2 years and nothing has happened , i went tote doctors and got checks i have ovarian cysts and i have gotten treated for it i tried birth control to see if it helps it go always , and i have tried natural drinks but nothing i cant get pregnant at all",1,54626,"hi, since you did get pregnant 5 months ago within a year of trying to get pregnant, it means that both you and your husband are fine, especially since you have also done the tests as well. it was unfortunate that you lost the pregnancy, but this occurs in 1/6 pregnancies. so, it should not concern you much, as it has happened only once. since you have been trying again for only two months now, i would advise you to continue trying for another 8-10 months.85% of couples conceive within a year of trying. only the remaining 15% need help. and since you have got pregnant before there is a very high chance that you will get pregnant soon. please do consider folic acid while trying to conceive, this is for normal development of the baby. hope this helps. regards."
"hello , in trying to get pregnant and i have been trying for basically 2 years and nothing has happened , i went tote doctors and got checks i have ovarian cysts and i have gotten treated for it i tried birth control to see if it helps it go always , and i have tried natural drinks but nothing i cant get pregnant at all",2,108096,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. it is true that theoretically you should have been clear of the injection within three months of discontinuation, however many women after being a depo-provera for a long time do not resume having ovulatory, regular, menstrual cycles until 6 to 9 months or even up to a year after discontinuation. unfortunately, it is difficult to artificially induce ovulation in women who are coming off depo-provera. if you were not trying to become pregnant, your cycle could be regulated temporarily with birth control pills, but if you're actually trying to get pregnant the best thing you can do with this point is to just keep trying and wait and see. if you feel any symptoms of pregnancy, and you haven't gotten your period for a while, i would do pregnancy test just to make sure. there is always a possibility even if your periods are not regular that you do ovulate sometimes. so in summary, continue having unprotected sex every other to every three days and give it some more time. 80% of couples will conceive within one year, and if after a year of trying you and your partner are unsuccessful, it might be a good idea to see a fertility specialist for an evaluation. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes, and good luck getting pregnant,"

so i have been going threw this for a year now and i cant seem to find answer . so here are my symptoms are my is joint is killing me and gets better with movement but if i push it to much i end up not being able to move without awful pain . i have been tested for lupus came up negative the only thing they found in all the blood test were i am positive for hla-b27 . been to a orthpictic surgeon and he cant find anything in my back that would cause the pain i am in . my other stators are in always tired but cant sleep by i cant get comfortable long enough to fall asleep . i always have stomach and abdominal pain which has gotten better along with my back sense i have been put on diclofenac sod in on 75mg twice a day . i have had diarrhoea for as long back i as i can remember . i also have lose of movement in my back . i also have weird pain in my joints for no reason out of no were . when they did the blood test they did not find lot of information in my blood .,1,56216,"hi thanks for choosing chat doctor for your medical query. i'm sorry but your question is deficient in a lot of information that would have been very helpful for me to answer. you have not mentioned if this was the first episode of pain, or she has past history. you did not mention if she hd any accompanying symptoms like diarrhea, vomiting, blood in stool or vomits, fever, pallor or jaundice. was her abdomen tender to touch? has the pain gotten worse, or it has subsided in intensity? is it only present in the upper abdomen or has it shifted to some other area or extended further? you also did not specify which tests and scans were ordered and came out negative. i can infer that the pain was very severe from the fact that she was hospitalized. upper abdominal pain can be due to a number of causes she might have pancreatitis, cholecystitis or peptic ulcer. pancreatic enzyme levels, ultrasound scan and h pylori antigen should be performed to rule out these conditions. as you have mentioned she had work up done at a hospital so i assume she was evaluated for these conditions. if all other tests are normal she may have functional abdominal pain. it is common amongst girls between the ages of 5 years to 14 years. it is because of an altered mechanism for pain perception so that the affected individual is more sensitive to pain. no definitive cause for this pain can be found but that does not mean it's not real. it usually presents in anxious child chat doctor. it is usually accompanied by other symptoms like recurrent diarrhea, constipation and headaches. the usual sites are around the umbilicus and in the upper abdomen. if your child has been worked up fully for all serious condition the best course of action is to reassure her. try to eliminate stress as much as possible, incorporate soluble fibers in her diet. probiotics are also helpful. do not limit her activities due to pain and try not to let her miss school. talk to her teachers and explain to them the situation. do not dismiss her pain as nothing, acknowledge its presence but try to make your child see that she has to continue her activities in a normal fashion. hope my answer helps you if you have any father questions i would be happy to answer."

"die doctor , by husband a me had relation during my fertile days a we are planning for baby.my doc had suggested to take tab enter & tab azithral course for a day to remove worms & infection any on 20 day from the first day of my last menses.i was just worried as to will this not hinder in this process if conception a implantation occurs.plz reply",1,100885,"hallow madam, i hope i can be of help to you today. the due date of delivery (dd) is calculated by a formula dd= last menstrual period date (lmp) + 9 months + 7 days. since you had your lmp on 10 july 2010, the dd would be on 17 april 2011. if dd provided to you is by ultrasonography, a variation of one week is acceptable as ultrasonography calculated dd is by the size of the baby and is calculated from the date of conception. to calculate the date of egg release (ovulation), it happens 14 days before the next expected menses. so considering your menstrual cycle of 30 or 31 days, next menses would be on 10 august and ovulation would be on 28 july 2010. the life of an egg is 24 hours and the sperms are active for 72 hours. hence, a period of one week around the ovulation is fertile period. so your fertile period would be 24 july to 1 august. thus, the conception would be in that period. now in this calculation, you have to make some modifications depending on the periodicity of your menstrual cycle. then you can locate your fertile period of that cycle. thus, the intercourse(s) during this fertile period are likely to cause the pregnancy. if you had a solitary intercourse during fertile period, that day or within 4 days of that day would be the day of conception. of course this all is based on the clinical calculations. if you want to ascertain the paternity of your child for any legal cause, you may go for dna test which would be a foolproof evidence. i hope this helps you."

a a needing to know if there are home remedies or if a need to be seen by a physician . a was cleaning earlier today using bleach and lysol ( not mixed together ) on different surfaces when a started getting a lump feeling in my throat a now have a dry cough that feels like something is stuck in my throat and a feel congested . a have been like this for about 4 hours,1,77258,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the sensation of feeling something stuck in your throat is a symptom of reflux-when the food that you eat or the acid in your stomach can back up and irritate it. this is common when you have a large belly at full term because your stomach is being pushed up towards your chest and also the hormones from the pregnancy cause the top opening of your stomach that connects to your esophagus to be looser, so food and acid can leak more easily. the best way to try to control this is to eat only small amounts at one time and to make sure you sit up for at least 2 hours after meals. taking antacids, which for the most part are all safe during pregnancy, can also help. trying to cough up what you feel in your throat will not help because there is not actually something solid coming up. these symptoms may be difficult to treat, but the good news is the symptoms will get better after you have the baby. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

(would you be having it then?) now your cycle is of 30 days period. so the expected date of ovulation should be 07 january. hence, if the conception takes place on 07 january, the due date of delivery would be 30 september. the hitch here is that you should have ovulation taking lace on 07 january. moreover, we have noticed that all the pregnancies do not last for 280 days. the delivery can take place any time between 3 weeks earlier to 1 week later than the expected due date of delivery. keeping these facts and calculations in mind, you may plan your sexual relations accordingly. i hope this will help you."

"a be been on lipo 6 black , after doing a home pregnancy test a found out in pregnant . an the fat burner cause any harm to the fetus . ave immediately discontinued the use of the fat burner . a a currently 26 years of age .",2,3703,"hello, i hope i can help you today. the common medications which are used to lower cholesterol, called statins, are not safe to use during pregnancy. for one, cholesterol levels actually normally rise during pregnancy, because cholesterol is used to make a lot of the hormones and developing tissues, such as the brain, in the fetus. for that reason, many medical professionals do not recommend any woman of reproductive age to start using cholesterol-lowering medication. the other reason is that the chance at your age of your actually having a heart attack or stroke just from high cholesterol is still extremely low. at your age, the likelihood of your having problems conceiving are relatively low and the best way to have a healthy pregnancy is to be healthy before you get pregnant. so i recommend following your doctors instructions regarding cholesterol-lowering medication, and delaying pregnancy until your cholesterol is under better control. in addition to medications there may be diet and exercise recommendations that your doctor may have which will put you in a better state of health then you are right now. so in summary, high cholesterol does not affect the fetus in any negative way, and the body actually makes more cholesterol during pregnancy to provide the fetus with nutrition. however, cholesterol-lowering medication can actually harm the fetus by decreasing cholesterol levels to the point where the proper development of the fetus could be compromised. so in order to both keep the baby safe and improve your health i would recommend delaying pregnancy until after you've worked with your primary physician in order to lower your cholesterol and get your body into a healthier state to prepare for pregnancy. you should be off cholesterol-lowering medication at the time you are trying to conceive. in the long run, missing high cholesterol medication for about a year especially at your young age and if you do not have any other cardiac risk factors, will not do harm to you. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"
"a be been on lipo 6 black , after doing a home pregnancy test a found out in pregnant . an the fat burner cause any harm to the fetus . ave immediately discontinued the use of the fat burner . a a currently 26 years of age .",3,97973,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. it takes a very high dose of radiation in order to cause any harm to pregnancy. in the early first trimester, high doses of radiation will produce miscarriage, rather than a genetically abnormal fetus. furthermore, a cumulative radiation dose of under 5 rd (which is the radiation in about three cat scans) has not been shown to be a risk for malformations in developing human fetuses. amniocentesis, or chorionic villus sampling, can only detect diseases of the chromosomes of the fetus. the fetuses chromosomes are formed at conception, and would not be affected by radiation exposure. therefore, these tests are not necessary unless a high risk is detected on the routine screening tests such as the triple test use in all pregnancies to calculate risk for chromosomal abnormalities. so in summary, i would not recommend aborting this pregnancy based on a radiation exposure under 5 rd before fetus even develops. i agree with your doctor to do the routine genetic screening-which consists of a triple test with nuclei translucency (nt) beginning at 11 weeks gestation and only consider amniocentesis or cvs if that testing appears normal. a level ii ultrasound also is essential in every pregnancy to rule out birth defects. however, i want to reemphasize that if the fetus survives the first trimester, it is unlikely that the radiation exposure caused any effect on the pregnancy at all. i hope that i was adequately able to answer your question today, and that my advice is reassuring. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

hi .. my brother has been suffering from sporadic fever since yesterday . i want to rule out dengue . the doctor i went to in the morning prescribed an antibiotic course for 5 days and asked me to stop the course when i called to inform her that his temperature had increased again in the afternoon . what do i do now ?,1,62164,"hi, it depends on the organism causing the infection. she has been prescribed an antibiotic and in case she is suffering from a bacterial infection, it should reduce in 3-4 days. however, in case she is suffering from a viral infection, the antibiotic will have no effect on it and fever will itself decrease in 6-7 days. i'd suggest you to do tepid sponging whenever her temperature starts to increase. take a cloth, completely soak it in water and apply the wet cloth to her whole body. this will be very effective in reducing the temperature for the time being. regards."

i had intercourse with my girlfriend last week with using condoms a also we did rub each other without condoms outside pulled out wen in about to cum and my girlfriend make me cum outside by using her hands .. now her periods is late and is there a possibility that she can get pregnant or no ..,3,46870,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. bleeding after sex can occur in women of all ages, but it is not unusual at all when a girl is in her teen years because her own menstrual cycle is still maturing and also chafing inside from sex can occur. furthermore, any bleeding from the uterus can produce cramps, even if it's at the incorrect time. condoms are extremely effective in preventing pregnancy if they were applied before any genital contact and remain on during intercourse and when you pull out. furthermore, the most common sign of pregnancy is a missed menstrual period, so if your girlfriend has not actually missed a cycle she really does not need to worry about pregnancy. if your girlfriend herself is also on birth control pills, irregular bleeding and spotting can be a side effect of the pill as well. so in summary, there are lots of reasons why your girlfriend could be bleeding irregularly, but if you are using proper contraception and condoms, pregnancy is not really one of the things you need to be concerned about. if your girlfriend starts to bleed regularly after sex she really should be evaluated by a doctor, as inflammation or infections of the cervix can cause postcoital (after sex) bleeding as well. i hope that i was adequately able to answer your question today, and that my advice was reassuring. best wishes,"

"sometimes when a step down on my foot it feels like the skin in the middle of my foot is detached from the muscle below it ? a done know how better to explain it other than it feels like this weird tightening of the skin , a pinching feeling when a curl my toes and then make my foot flat .",2,13930,"hello, and thank you for your question. fortunately, you probably do not have fibromyalgia. there are several possible causes of pain just in the toe. if there is a pinched nerve in the lower spine, it can cause pain that can be just in one toe. if this is the case, you may find that the pain is worse with change in position, such as lying flat or standing up. pain in the toe, typically the big toe, is common in a disorder called gout, in which the body has too much uric acid. the pain usually lasts a few days at a time, and is usually associated with redness and swelling. pain in the toes can be caused by corns or other skin problems that look small but feel very severe. pins and needles, shooting, on-and-off pains can be caused by irritation to a nerve by diabetes, by lack of vitamins such as b12, or by pressure - similar to the ""foot falling asleep"" feeling we sometimes get if we cross our legs too long. fibromyalgia, on the other hand, is usually a ""pain all over"" problem - back pain, neck pain, arm pain, knee pain, without another cause such as arthritis. it usually does not cause just one part of the body to hurt - most patients say that ""everything hurts"". in my practice, i start with finding out as much as i can from the patient about how the pain feels and how long it has been going on, and if it seems related to anything else. then we examine the foot to look for anything going on with the skin, check if the nerves of the foot are normally sensitive, not as sensitive as usual, or more sensitive, and then we may check blood tests to detect diabetes or vitamin deficiency or other problems as needed. fibromyalgia is diagnosed by obtaining a careful history of where the patient is having pain, other medical problems, and completing a physical exam including what is called a ""painful point"" exam where the doctor pushes at certain places in the body - on the back and near the joints - to see if this causes pain. i hope that my answer to your question is helpful. if you have any further questions, please check back with us. i hope your toe is much better soon."

"my husband has had a wound vac on since monday and his wound drainage is yellowish-brown and smells like rotten eggs . any idea what bacteria would be causing the infection ? he is currently in the hospital now awaiting multiple tests , including cbc , wound culture and of scan .",1,38059,"hi, welcome to chat doctor. i understand your concern regarding your husbands recurring infection. the most common cause of recurrent infection is the occurrence of resistance in bacteria causing infection. the bacteria develop resistance due to prolonged use of antibiotics and irrational use of broad spectrum antibiotics. it is very necessary to do a culture and sensitivity of the pus from the wound before continuing any antibiotic. i suggest you get a repeat culture and sensitivity of both hip joint wound and the hernia wound and get a prescription for appropriate antibiotic based on that test. you can also detect if the same organism has caused infection in both sites. there is a possibility of the organism causing infection in the hip spread to the hernia due to close vicinity of the wounds, but it should be confirmed by culture only. proper care and chat doctor. i hope i have answered your query satisfactorily. wishing your husband a speedy recovery. thanks."

(regular use of emergency pill is harmful)conception occurs if she was in 10th to 18th day of her cycle(in a regular cycle of 28 day duration). you can ask her at what day she is in and wait for next cycle to occur. if it delayed by 7 days then get done upt to diagnose if pregnant and then the required treatment can be taken. regards"

a have had an uri and under a lot of stress as my husband has been in hospital for cardiac stent and in the past week there has been frequent bouts of numbness and tingling along my left jaw line into my lower lip ; feels like awakening from dental work,1,44715,"hello, i can understand your concern. it would have been helpful if you had mentioned which tooth was treated for root canal. as you are mentioning that the tooth was black and had cracks in it, i am assuming that the tooth is in the lower front region, and you had had some trauma to the lower jaw area which made the tooth dead and also hurt the chin and lip. other possibility is that if the tooth was dead for many years, it may have developed a periapical cyst in relation with the tooth which might be pressing on the mental nerve supplying lower lip and chin and may cause numbness of those areas. alternatively, the numbness may have started after taking local anesthesia in the lower front area for some tooth problem and the injection might have been given deep. in any case, it seems that the nerve supplying sensation to the lower front area of jaw along with lower lip and chin (mental nerve) is damaged. usually, if the nerve is damaged, it can regenerate in 3-6 months and the sensations can return. if you are not sure regarding the crown on the tooth, you can avoid it for some months and take care not to bite hard things with that tooth so that it does not fracture. you can get the crown after the numbness is solved. i would also advise you to visit an oral and maxillofacial surgeon for the examination of the area and regarding numbness. he/she might take an x-ray to rule out presence of periapical lesion or cyst in relation with the tooth. crown should surely be postponed until this possibility is ruled out. i hope this information helps you. thank you for choosing chat doctor. i wish you feel better soon. best,"

"well .. a am 30 year old man , who is currently single and have never got married.i used to ejaculate so often though ! that started around 8 years ago.at the beginning , a did that like once a week , but within the past 3 years , a used to do it nearly everyday.i tried to give up , but every time a decided that , a only gave up for a week or maximum 9 days then back to the same dirty habits.my question is : a heard that people who ejaculate so often will become barren and can not give birth to a baby . of a totally give up although a have done that for nearly 8 years , is it still possible to give birth to a baby if a marry soon like within 6 months or after a year ? a have never checked my semen , so a do not know whether ejaculation has driven me to be barren or not , but a recently heard that it is terrible and decided to give it up.and would be there any negative effects if a give it up forever ? somebody said one time of ejaculation equals to making love with a lady for 12 times , is that true ? a am worried about myself.please reply me asap.you should take into account that a have no girl friend and a do not have sex with ladies , because my tradition prohibits me to do that with a lady who is not my wife .",1,108096,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. it is true that theoretically you should have been clear of the injection within three months of discontinuation, however many women after being a depo-provera for a long time do not resume having ovulatory, regular, menstrual cycles until 6 to 9 months or even up to a year after discontinuation. unfortunately, it is difficult to artificially induce ovulation in women who are coming off depo-provera. if you were not trying to become pregnant, your cycle could be regulated temporarily with birth control pills, but if you're actually trying to get pregnant the best thing you can do with this point is to just keep trying and wait and see. if you feel any symptoms of pregnancy, and you haven't gotten your period for a while, i would do pregnancy test just to make sure. there is always a possibility even if your periods are not regular that you do ovulate sometimes. so in summary, continue having unprotected sex every other to every three days and give it some more time. 80% of couples will conceive within one year, and if after a year of trying you and your partner are unsuccessful, it might be a good idea to see a fertility specialist for an evaluation. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes, and good luck getting pregnant,"

"a am a 63 year old . and a am diebeted 2 with vascular decease and also high blood pressure . a just had bypass on my upper left leg two vascular arteries . since then a had problem urine , a have been wearing this foley cat . a notice blood and puss coming thru the clear hose . by g.u . wants to do surgery in a month is there any thing a can do , while a am waiting .",1,5481,"hi there, im sorry to hear about the medical problems your father is having. when i hear the symptoms that your father is having, the first thing that comes to my mind is claudication. claudication is pain while walking due to arterial insufficiency- basically, the muscles in the legs don't get enough blood flow when they are being used, and they start to ache. this is caused by peripheral vascular disease and is common in smokers, diabetics, and patients with high cholesterol levels. these patients will often have a history of coronary artery disease and sometimes renal problems as well. the first thing i would recommend is for your father to start a waking regiment and walk consistently every day. he should aim to walk for about 30 minutes a day. if he cants do 30 minutes, he should do as much as he can, and then try to do a little more each day. the most important thing is daily consistency - he has to do it every day, not just one or two times a week. i'd also recommend he check his cholesterol levels, and if they are high a statin such as lipitor (atorvastatin) can help lower his levels and prevent further damage. finally, if he continues to have problems with walking after 6 months of a dedicated walking problem, then he should see a vascular surgeon and have his arterial vessels looked at in his leg with ultrasound. i hope this is helpful. please contact me with any questions."

by son has had a wound on his back that has not healed x1 week . be has also had loose stools runny nose and what seems to be an fri . be also has reactive airway disease . i have also had a wound appear on my neck this week and have had headaches . would any of this be from mrs ?,1,92242,"hello ! i understand your concern. i would like to know if these symptoms are persisting or resolved now. the symptoms that your son has had may be related to alcohol intoxication. but its plasma level has to be above 80 mg/dl to show these symptoms. he has presence of alcohol in his blood and so alcohol has to be taken into consideration in this situation. maybe his brain is more vulnerable to the age (school age, you have not told his age). but also other diagnosis have to be excluded like a possible subarachnoid hemorrhage, possible meningitis or just migraine. has he ever had throbbing headaches ? did he have fever? it would be a sign of meningitis. also neck stiffness and headache. if the symptoms persisted a head ct scan and a lumbar puncture would be necessary to rule out subarachnoid hemorrhage. to make a proper treatment we should rule out this diagnosis. at the meantime i would recommend a lot of fluids to lower to zero alcohol plasma level and antiemetic for the vomiting. hope to have been helpful! thank you for using chat doctor! best wishes"

hi i have had pain in my stomach and lower back this is now coming into 5th week the first few weeks i couldn't even walk now in had lots of different tablets been back and forward with this pain and none can tell what it is in at my wits end any idea i suffer from diverticulitis its not the same pain .if i lay in bed its the only pain relief in had,1,19985,"hello, sorry to hear about the disc injury you are having. coming to the disc injury, any disc injury is not mandatory that it will lead to the motor, sensory, motor sensory both or no symptoms. the symptoms are totally individual based. in your case, the nerve is getting pinched by the disc prolapse which will be a small fragment troubling the nerve on its nerve root where it is coming out of the spinal cord. nerve has got two major functions - one is motor and other is sensory. the motor includes movement and sensory included the pain, temperature, numbness, tingling etc. in your case it is sensory and by this, the motor functions are reduced. as you have tried to put hot water bag over the calf which was cold, i would recommend trying keeping it over the lower back, as that is where the nerve root is. once the nerve root gets the warmth the nerve supplying the muscles will get warm sensation back. also, with this, the pain will come down. now coming to the therapy part, if you have unbearable pain then medication might be looked for. but most cases are ceased from medication after 7 days. i will recommend you to first try out the mckenzie maneuver of lying on the stomach and making an extension of the spine with the help of the upper limb. you can check this out online. as this maneuver is kind of at its best to centralize the pain only in the back region. once you get the pain centralized in the lower back you can use hot water bag over it to provide the soothing effect. once there is centralization and soothing of pain you can start slowly the core stability exercise and also the lower limb strengthening while lying on the mat. in my clinical practice of 12 years, a maximum number of cases have responded well with the mckenzie maneuver and exercises. you can take the help of a physical therapist if you wish to. you should do well in 3-4 weeks if time. post which you can continue exercises like 3-5 days a week. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further. jay in chat doctor."

"year doctor , i am 41 years old male unmarried . a have lot of confusions fear and anxiety unnecessary thoughts which is repeatedly coming in mind and make me fear . in the year 2007 when a was in an official meeting a felt giddiness and as if a kind of flying and imbalance in my body and the fear which i had aggravated it , a consulted my doctor and he advised me to take clonozepam tablets am taking it till now and my doctor says i can take it whenever i feel anxious . kindly advise me please",1,38044,"dear, we understand your concerns went through your details. i do understand. serotonin supplements (selfie) increase serotonin levels helping depression and other brain-related disorders. your case is anxiety disorder. i see you also has suicidal ideation. anxiety disorders are a category of mental disorders characterized by feelings of anxiety and fear, where anxiety is a worry about future events and fear is a reaction to current events. when a person fears about something now (which may or may not happen in the future) and if he does it repeatedly, it is called anxiety disorder. these fear provoking feelings are called anxiety, and it may cause variety of physical symptoms, such as a racing heart, restlessness, helplessness and shakiness. treatment consists of cognitive behavioral therapy, lifestyle changes, relaxation therapy and meditation. once you learn how to manage your anxiety yourself with the help of the above treatment methods, you will be cured. the process is a bit lengthy and could take any period between one year to 2 years according to the depth of the anxiety problem and the circumstances at which the patient lives. keep the period of treatment in mind, prepare yourself to take up the treatment and consult a psychologist online or in person. if you require more of my help in this aspect, please use this url. make sure that you include every minute detail possible. hope this answers your query. further clarifications are welcome. good luck. take care."

"over the past month i have been getting symptoms of pregnancy . i have random head aches , backaches , the whole month i have had very painful cramps . running to the bathroom , nausea all the time , every thing i smell or eat makes me a little sick . i have a lot of gas from both ends , my breast are not sore but they have gotten bigger and the ring around it has also gotten larger . anything i take for these pains it still will not go away . i just received my period not to long ago . it was lighter than usual and it lasted the normal days . after my cycle i did take a pregnancy test after and it came back negative . a am still feeling the same problems i had before my period . i am a diabetic and i do know some of these symptoms can be cause by that . i still would like to know if i could be pregnant ?",1,8772,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the proper way to use the nearing is to put it in, leave it in for 3 weeks, take it out, wait one week, and replace it. during the week you are not wearing the ring, you should have some bleeding that is considered a menstrual cycle. if you wore the ring continuously for two months and then had a new one replaced but only removed it 3 days later, the pinkish spotting was your ""period"", which is caused by not wearing the ring. the bleeding was very light because you had suppressed it by continuously wearing the ring for over 2 months. so you should expect your next period about 4-5 weeks after the episode of spotting that you had. if you do not have menses by then, i recommend repeating the pregnancy test at that time. if you did not have regular monthly cycles before you used the ring, your cycle will follow your regular pattern that you typically have when not using hormonal contraception. if you are trying to get pregnant, you should have intercourse about every other day and begin taking prenatal vitamins as it benefits the health of the baby for the vitamins to be present at conception. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

(as you said he has difficulty in walking now). you can also say to his parents that --- they can continue with all religious customs along with medicines, may be then they will agree... with medicine, he will start showing improvement in few days only... it is psychosis and patients will not agree to go to any doctor willingly, so you might need to take him forcefully. this is well accepted as it is for his benefit only. even if he doesn't agree for oral medicine there are injectables which are given to such patients... take the right step, take him to a doctor. hope the reply is useful feel free to ask more questions"

hi in pregnant and today i went to the doctor to get results from a blood test that was done last appointment and i was told that my red blood cells are not growing how they are suppose to that have a weird color and a weird shape i wanted to know what can be the cause of that,1,30687,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the number of white and red blood cells in your urine has nothing to do with an std or pregnancy. urinary tract infections typically cause bacteria, a substance called leukocyte esterase, and nitrites to be present in your urine. red blood cells can also appear if the inside of your bladder is inflamed from the infection. however, the presence of red blood in your urine can also be caused by other conditions of the kidneys or bladder that cause bleeding without infection. the most common of these is a kidney stone, and if you have had very severe pain in your back or lower pelvis, especially on one side, that diagnosis is also possible. pregnancy or stds do not generally cause blood to be seen in the urine. if you are concerned about pregnancy or std exposure, these can be tested separately, but you do not have to be concerned about these conditions because of the presence of blood cells in your urine. i hope i was able to answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

a had surgery 2weeks ago wednesday . by ovaries were removed a cluster of cyst located right behind my cervix was also removed . a have been experiencing a cramps sometime severe since sunday night . is this normal ? should a head to of ? or call my doctor first thing in the morning ?,1,52955,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. in the first trimester of pregnancy, your ovaries produce the hormone progesterone which normally is made by the placenta once it reaches adequate size. so it is not unusual in the first trimester pregnancy to feel pain in your ovaries. in addition, as your uterus stretches, you also may experience some cramping and pulling sensations, which can be on the sides. the only thing that is concerning is if you have not had an ultrasound this pregnancy to confirm that it is normal and located in your uterus. if you already have had an ultrasound for this pregnancy it is unlikely that there could be anything harmful going on, especially if you are not bleeding. so if the pain is severe enough that you cannot function, especially if you have not yet had an ultrasound, if you cannot reach her doctor within a reasonable amount of time, you may want to pursue care in an emergency setting. if you have had a normal ultrasound earlier in this pregnancy, you really do not need to worry, as your ovaries are normally examined as part of your pregnancy ultrasound and a large cyst would've already been detected. tylenol, or acetaminophen is safe to use for pain at the normal adult dosage during all trimesters of pregnancy, and you can try to see if that helps with the pain. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

a friend of mine has recently had rectal cancer surgery . prior to surgery she did radiation and oral chemo ( 6 pills a day ) . the is now experiencing ( what a think may be psychosis ) and tried to commit suicide . the thinks she is loosing her mind . would this be a result of the surgery and chemo ? a am very frightened for her ! thank you.darlene dickens,1,88375,"hi, it seems to be in stage 3b. there is fair chance of cure after surgery and chemotherapy. after surgery, and during and after chemo, blood tests will be done to determine if she has normal levels of a tumor marker called ca-125. a ct scan, pet-ct scan, or mri could also be done to evaluate her response to treatment. patients who are too weak to have full staging and debunking surgery are sometimes treated with chemo as the first treatment. if the chemo works and the patient becomes stronger, surgery to debunk the cancer may be done, often followed by more chemo. most often, 3 cycles of chemo are given before surgery, with at least 3 more after surgery (for a total of at least 6 cycles). this answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only. please see your personal physician for further evaluation of your individual case. regards"

"a am 34 weeks pregnant and have been having contractions/tightening since sunday.my doctor says unless they are about 5minutes apart , there is nothing that is to be done.the pain comes every 10 to 20 minutes and believe me , it is no grafton hicks.i have a cervical stitch in place and is to be removed at 37 weeks.what do i do ? a done know how much longer i can endure this.my waters have not yet broken and there is no blood .",1,85262,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. there are two possibilities of what may be going on if you do not yet see a heartbeat with your pregnancy. the first, even though you are sure of your lmp, conception can take place at a different time in your cycle than you expected. the egg can live inside you up to 72 hours after ovulation, and sperm can remain alive inside you for up to 5 days. so you actually may have conceived a week later than you thought, which means that you are only 6 weeks pregnant. it can be normal to not see a heartbeat at 6 weeks. the other possibility is that the fetus died already at 6 weeks, which is a miscarriage that has not come out yet. the way we can figure out what is going on is to check another ultrasound in a week or so. if there is no heartbeat by 7 weeks, then the diagnosis of a miscarriage is correct. so i know it is hard to be patient, but there is nothing that can be done to prevent miscarriage. one of every 10 pregnancies are miscarriages, meaning 90 percent of the time after a miscarriage women go on to have a healthy baby. i hope i was able to answer your question and that this information was helpful to you. best wishes, and good luck with the pregnancy,"

"by 7 years old son was bit by our owners dog , which they say is being vaccinated regularly . yesterday my son has taken 2nd injection of jaipur . today after bath there seems to be slight puss coming out of the wound . just wanted to know why is that .",1,5596,"hello dear. to be on safer side i would advise you to get your son vaccinated again. but it depends on the severity of wound. if it is just minor abrasions then just 2 booster doses on 0 and 3rd day is enough. if the wound is severe or in sites like head, face, neck etc. then the entire course should be repeated. some doctors may suggest just a tetanus injection, and ask you to watch the dog for ten days. if there are any signs of madness in the dog in the course of ten days then report immediately and get vaccinated. otherwise, just a tetanus is enough. this may be the view of some doctors in case you are very sure that the pet dog doe snot have symptoms of rabies and its vaccinated. but still there is a minor chance of risk. why to take even the slightest risk? because once if a person contracts rabies then mortality is 100%.hence, you can contact a physician and let him assess the severity of wound and in case it is a minor wound just ask your son to take 2 booster doses on 0 and 3rd day. though the immunity lasts for 2 to 10 years but still it is advisable to take booster dose of rabies irrespective of the interval between the previous full course of vaccination, because we don't want to take risk with rabies. hope i have answered your question. feel free to contact me if you have any more questions. i'll be glad to help you. all the besting warm regards chat doctor."

"a have been taking marvel for years , my last 5 packs were run back to back and changed to cerazette . 4 days into my current pill pack . a had a 6 day period a couple of days after stating cerazette when should a be protected against pregnancy ? thanksa6",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"top of the noon to you air , a am 22 years old . a had intercourse with my girlfriend and i din used protection and i am very much sure that sperms does not came out during intercourse , but still is there any chances that she might get pregnant ? and if she take pill , is is safe for future for her ? your kind reply will be highly appreciated . thanks and regards",1,102839,"hi, i guess your concern is about getting pregnant of your girlfriend from pre-ejaculatory liquid near vagina. so my straight forward answer is, yes. there are chances but it's very, very less to getting her pregnant. usually chances of getting pregnant is more when ejaculation occurs when penis is inside the vagina. but in your case as you told that your penis did not go inside the vagina, and you were just rubbing it against her outer vagina. so there is very, very less chance of getting pregnant. so don't worry, relax. you also told that u didn't have condom on that time. and there is pre-ejaculation occurs around her vagina. so there is little chances having for getting pregnant. for that you do not need to take tension because your girlfriend can use emergency contraceptive pill (i-pill) within 72 hrs of unprotected intercourse. as told by you that you people had intercourse 2 days ago. so there is sufficient time to take emergency contraception. this is usually available your nearby medical store at affordable prices. with this above discussion you can try out my suggestions-1. don't waste time and get the i-pill as early as possible. ask your girlfriend to take it. wait till her next menses. if she gets menses on her expected or delay date, she will not be pregnant. 2. you can do urinary pregnancy test after 5-6 days of her missed period. it is available at affordable prices your nearby medical store. buy it and ask your girlfriend to do it by herself. if it is negative, she's not pregnant. if it is positive visit to nearby gynecologist for further help. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further. chat doctor."

(regular use of emergency pill is harmful)conception occurs if she was in 10th to 18th day of her cycle(in a regular cycle of 28 day duration). you can ask her at what day she is in and wait for next cycle to occur. if it delayed by 7 days then get done upt to diagnose if pregnant and then the required treatment can be taken. regards"

"5 days ago a had a molar apicectomy with sinus membrane perforation ( no lifting or sealing after ) . it is possible that the root of the molar to pass through membrane and can not heal ? that can a do and what are the symptoms . a had some sinus bleeding behind soft palate first 2 days , yesterday after sneezing ( with my mouth open ) and today when a did some exercises ( not to much ) .",1,22667,"dear patient, i can understand your concern and feel sorry for the pain you are suffering from. you are informing me that when you got the upper molar extracted, the dentist told you that the bone between the sinus and tooth is destroyed and sinus cavity is open. roots of upper molar often are found inside the maxillary sinus, which causes opening of the sinus cavity while extraction of the tooth, creating an oro-antral fistula, that is a direct connection between oral cavity and sinus cavity. in this case, the food or water you take has chances of passing infection in the sinus through mouth and the infection does not resolve. it is mandatory to close this connection between mouth and the sinus. it could be done by the dentist by taking stitches in the area when he found that sinus has opened, but it can also be done now. however, as about 2 weeks has passed since extraction, the opening would not be as much clear as it would have been during extraction. a blood clot may have filled the area. so what you need to do now is, go to an oral surgeon or an ent specialist. i know you have insurance problem, but there seems no other solution to your problem. you might have to go for x-rays and probably ct scan of the area to diagnose if oro-antral fistula actually exists and if it does, you might have to go for a little surgery to close the communication between mouth and sinus followed by antibiotics to resolve the infection. i hope this information helps. thank you for choosing chat doctor. i wish you get well soon. best,"

hi i am 26 of and my husband age is 33 . we were married past 1 year 7 months . i am trying to conceive but couldn't . my husband health is normal and sperm generation and mobility is of as tested . i am advised to ferry 50 my from day 2 and as well prognova . an you please tell me what is the use of these tablets,1,12366,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, i want to reassure you that it commonly can take up to a year from healthy couples to conceive. you are not diagnosed as infertile unless you and your husband have been trying to conceive (which means having unprotected intercourse at least two or three days a week) for at least a year. folic acid is a b vitamin that does not help you to get pregnant, however it is recommended to take during early pregnancy because it helps prevent birth defects. siphene, also known as camphene citrate, is a fertility medication. it can help induce ovulation in women who are infertile because they do not ovulate. however, if your periods normally come every month, there is no reason to suspect that you are not ovulating. because you are under the age of 35, i recommend that you and your husband to not take any more fertility medications and try to conceive for another six months on your own. normally, your most fertile time is between the time your period stops until you start to feel premenstrual symptoms. for most couples, that means having sex every other day from about the seventh day of your cycle until the 23rd to 25th day. if you and your husband have not conceived in another six months, i recommend both of you see fertility specialist, as 50% of the time lack of pregnancy can be a problem with the men sperm as well. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful, and you and your husband are able to have a baby soon. best wishes,"
