yes a just had an electrical type sensation in my chest a reached for my cell phone in my pocket but it was not there or even in the room it instantly woke me up in not felt good today my heart was beating hard at the time and numbness was in my hands what could this be ?,1,25338,"hello and thank you for using chat doctor. i carefully read your question and understand your concern. but you should not worry, its nothing serious. as you describe, my opinion is that it might be a rhythm issue. someone can feel strong and fast heart beats for different reasons. it may be a simple sinus tachycardia. this means that the heart is beating faster than 100 beats for minute. its normal range in a resting condition is between 60-100 beats for minute. when it goes up you may feel a strong heart beat in your chest and a sensation like your body is beating too. another reason for this sensation might be what we call an ekstrasystol.these is electrical heart impulses that generates in some parts of heart different from normal sinus rhythm. this generates an escaped beat that the person feels like jumping ore bumping. it gives the sensation like a beat is skipping, may experience palpitations or an anxiety sensation that your daughter explains like trembling. this extrasistoles may happen from different reasons from simple emotional stress to other pathologies like anemia, hyperthyroidism etc. so, my opinion as cardiologist is that you have nothing to worry. it is just a simple episode, and it is quite normal in younger ages. only if these symptoms persist and begins to interfere the daily live, if i was your treating doctor i will recommend some examinations like a blood analysis to exclude anemia, the thyroid hormones, an electrocardiogram, echocardiography and of course a holder monitoring. this will help us to document and see what happens with heart rhythm. at meantime, i will recommend your daughter to avoid coffee, caffeine products because they rise heart frequency and extrasistolic beats. i encourage her to have physical training because sometimes it helps in reducing extrasistoles, tachycardia, even making them disappear. wish i was helpful. take good care. best regards"

what of the best medicine available of cure of control psoriasis .,3,87714,"hello and welcome to chat doctor i can understand your concern and frustration and i will try to guide you to the best of my knowledge. psoriasis is characterized by the presence of well-defined, thick scaly plaques mainly involving the scalp, and extensor surfaces like elbow, knee, lower back etc. the disease has a chronic course and the course is fluctuated by remissions and relapses, however there is no permanent cure for psoriasis. specific topical treatment options for psoriasis plaques consists of ointments containing potent steroid with or without salicylic acid. these are available in ointment form for plaques involving the body and as lotions/gels/foam form for scalp psoriasis. topical vitamin d analogues like calcitriol, calcipotriene etc. are also effective for localized plaque psoriasis. besides specific remedies for psoriasis, moisturizers form an important part in the management of psoriasis because of the thick scaly nature of the plaques. moisturisers enhance the penetration of topical active ingredients as well as prevents or delays side effects like skin atrophy etc. unlike extensive psoriasis disease for which both oral and topical treatment is required, for limited disease topical treatment alone is effective. phototherapy, particularly nb-uvb phototherapy is one of the several treatment options for psoriasis. it is effective and well tolerated by most. moreover, nb-uvb phototherapy is one of the safest options for treatment of psoriasis and can also be used even in pregnant females as well as child chat doctor. other treatments for widespread disease includes immunosuppressive like methotrexate, cyclosporin. oral retinoids e.g. accretion can also be used for widespread psoriasis either alone or together with phototherapy. hope this helpsregards"

"in november a had a gallbladder attack in which a went to the hospital to get pain medication to relieve me of the pain . a have had no re-occuring attacks since . however , a had an ultrasound done , and my results showed that a have a gallbladder that is packed with stones . by doctor suggested a leave it to see if a have any more problems . but should a get it removed incas it ruptures ? or can a leave it , and hope a done have re-occuring attacks ?",1,77921,"most people who have gallstones do not have symptoms. if you have symptoms, you most likely will have mild pain in the pit of your stomach or in the upper right part of your belly. pain may spread to your right upper back or shoulder blade area. sometimes the pain is more severe. it may be steady, or it may come and go. or it may get worse when you eat. you may decide to go to the doctor because of pain in your belly. in this case, your doctor will ask you questions about when the pain started, where it is, and if it comes and goes or is always there. your doctor may order imaging tests. these take pictures of the inside of your body. an ultrasound of the belly is the best test to find gallstones. this test does not hurt. your ultrasound may not show gallstones. but if your doctor still thinks you have a problem with your gallbladder, he or she may order a gallbladder scan. in this test, a doctor injects dye into a vein in your arm. then a machine takes x-rays as the dye moves through your liver, bile duct, gallbladder, and intestine. if you do not have symptoms, you probably do not need treatment. if your first gallstone attack causes mild pain, your doctor may tell you to take pain medicine and wait to see if the pain goes away. you may never have another attack. waiting to see what happens usually will not cause problems. if you have a bad attack, or if you have a second attack, you may want to have your gallbladder removed. a second attack means you are more likely to have future attacks. many people have their gallbladders removed, and the surgery usually goes well. doctors most often use laparoscopic surgery. for this, your surgeon will make small cuts in your belly and remove your gallbladder. you will probably be able to go back to work or your normal routine in a week or two, but it may take longer for some people. sometimes the surgeon will have to make a larger cut to remove the gallbladder. it will take longer for you to recover from this type of surgery. regards and take care"

"i , may a answer your health queries right now ? please type your query here ... i was told today i have ovarian cysts and like 1 pm of fibroid on cavity of uterus , and said not to be concern about it , in 38 yrs old been trying for 7 months to get pregnant after 1st miscarriage not luck.so i need to know should i be concern ?",1,43820,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, i want to reassure you that no matter what your endometrial measurement may be, 80% of couples will conceive within one year naturally. couples are not diagnosed as infertile until you have been trying and been unable to become pregnant for over one year. endometrial thickness is really only relevant in the context of couples trying to get pregnant through in vitro fertilization. the thickness of your uterine lining is somewhat related to your estrogen levels. when couples are undergoing ivf, treating with additional estrogen can thicken the uterine lining. however, because you've been only trying to get pregnant for four months, your endometrial lining may have absolutely nothing to do with the reason why you have not yet conceived. furthermore, unless your husbands' sperm count has been shown to be decreased, magazine should not have any effect on fertility nor should affect any health of a developing baby should you conceive. medications taken during pregnancy by the mother can affect the fetus, but not any medication taken by the father, because medication cannot be transmitted before fertilization through sperm. so unless the medication causes the sperm count to be low or abnormal, there is no medical reason why your husband needs to be off his medication for colitis in order for you and need to conceive successfully. i suggest that if he needs the medication for his health that he continue to take it. as for is maximizing your chance of healthy pregnancy, the best thing you can do is get plenty of sleep, eat a well-balanced diet, take prenatal vitamins, and tried to have regular(at least 2 to 3 days a week) unprotected intercourse from the time your menstrual period finishes until you begin to feel premenstrual symptoms. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and i wish you and your husband the best of luck in conceiving. best wishes,"

"yes , my husband had a cat scan which showed 2 shadowed areas on his kidneys in kept . be was bleeding and did the scan because thought he may have kidney stones .. had another scan yesterday and areas have not decreased and still present but he has not bled since sept. any ideas ? ?",1,6016,"hi, thanks for writing in. your son might have had congenital hy chat doctor. the present renal scan at 8 years shows that the kidney is bulging out due to urine in the collecting system, but this becomes normal when there is increased force in the kidney after giving lasix which is a diuretic. las ix administration is a method to study real and apparent swelling of the renal collecting system. since the swelling in pelvicalyceal system disappears after taking lasix, it is conclusive that he does not have any real obstruction in the kidney collecting system and the swelling that is apparent on the scan is temporary in nature. it will be good to do blood tests for kidney functions regularly as advised by his doctors to make sure the kidneys are working fine and serum creatinine and blood urea values are in the normal range."
"yes , my husband had a cat scan which showed 2 shadowed areas on his kidneys in kept . be was bleeding and did the scan because thought he may have kidney stones .. had another scan yesterday and areas have not decreased and still present but he has not bled since sept. any ideas ? ?",2,105897,"hi. to begin with, the treatment that your husband has undergone seems to be correct medically, more or less. to begin with he was suffering from locally advanced prostate cancer which was downstage and then surgically removed. however, he had a relapse of his disease in the bones and was placed on hormonal treatment. he seemed to be suffering from hormone resistant prostate cancer which can occur in 10% patients to start with. thus, he failed to respond to most of the treatments and eventually died of his disease. at every stage of progression, doing a scan is not mandatory. just a rising psa and symptoms are enough to know that the disease is progressing. doing a scan only documents that the disease has spread to a particular part. it will neither change the treatment nor the outcome. the blood was basically because of 2 reasons. one the disease in the lung which can commonly lead to bleeding on its own of varying quantity. added to that was the fact that he was in liver failure which further increases the chances of bleeding from any site. zynga has many side effects and one has to weigh the risks against the benefits and take a call. i assume, and you should to that the call to give zynga despite liver failure by your doctor was in good faith and based on sound judgement. i think the only part where your doctor failed you entirely was by not keeping you informed at every step the prognosis, the treatment options, the disease status and the likely outcome. it is something that i would have done and is nothing but unfortunate. while it would not have changed the outcome of your husband, it might have left you in peace after his demise. hope my answer takes care of your unrest in some measure, and you find strength enough to move on in life. take care"

pm currently on the birth control implonon and have been for a year . a haunt had a period in about two months . by last one was very heavy . a think in starting my period but its tinged pink very lite . a had unprotected sex a week and four days ago . to in not sure if what in having is implantation bleeding .,1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

me and my boyfriend had sex but did to use protection when he moved a felt the precut and there was a oil bit of blood a a wondering if a could get pregnant with his precut and why was their blood ?,1,76773,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. pregnancy symptoms vary widely between women, and many of the symptoms of pregnancy are similar to the symptoms of pms. anyone who has unprotected sex is at risk for pregnancy. however, if you do not have sex during your current menstrual cycle, there is no way you could be pregnant. the most common sign of pregnancy is a missed menstrual cycle. if you did not miss a cycle, and had a negative pregnancy test, and you did not have unprotected sex this cycle, there is no way you could be pregnant. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was reassuring. best wishes,"
me and my boyfriend had sex but did to use protection when he moved a felt the precut and there was a oil bit of blood a a wondering if a could get pregnant with his precut and why was their blood ?,2,77227,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, i want to clarify, if you are virgin and have not had sexual intercourse or ejaculation directly in the opening of your vagina, your chance of pregnancy is really nonexistent. sperm die when exposed to air, so there is no way that you can become pregnant from sperm that ejaculated outside the vagina. furthermore, is very uncommon to find women who ovulate during their menstrual cycle. therefore, you were most likely not at the fertile time of your cycle when you and your boyfriend had genital contact. furthermore, irregular bleeding can be caused by travel, changes in weight, hormonal imbalances and stress, especially the stress of worrying about getting pregnant. just because your period was light this month does not mean that there was anything wrong. now omens menstrual cycle is exactly the same every month, and as long as you got a period at the usual time, there is no reason to suspect pregnancy if the bleeding was different in quality than what you usually see. so i think that it is fine to be reassured that you did not conceive from this encounter with your boyfriend. if you continue to have irregular menstrual cycles for more than three months, you may want to visit your local physician as some hormonal imbalances can cause these problems and should be tested for. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was reassuring. best wishes,"

"i , a am 21 years old . a am not sure of what a have is normal or not . very time a speak to my girlfriend even on the phone , little drops of sperm come out . should a get some medicine for it ? would this effect my ability to have kids.thanks for your help",1,61144,"hello, how are you? thanks for writing into chat doctor. my name is chat doctor. i am a liver and pancreas surgeon and i hope to answer your question today. i am sorry to hear about your diagnosis, and i am happy to hear that your girlfriend is planning on getting vaccinated. the reason why booster shots are given during vaccination is to create a subset of immune cells called ""memory b cells"". these cells store the memory of the antigen (in this case hepatitis b virus) and will produce protective antibodies as soon as they encounter it the next time (for ex if your girlfriend by any chance gets infected). the creation of memory b cells may require multiple exposures to the antigen - hence the booster doses. having said that, this holds true to the majority of cases. some people can develop high levels of protective antibodies even with minute exposure to antigens. the only way to know for sure whether a protective level of antibodies have been attained is to measure the anti-bug antibody levels (which is done routinely in most laboratories). some people who are poor responders may need up to 5-6 booster shots before a protective level is reached. so in short, if you want to be sure of the immunity of your girlfriend, i would measure her blood levels of protective antibodies (>10 iu is considered protective). this does not mean i am discouraging you from getting the booster doses - the only way to be fully immune is to complete the vaccination schedule. hope this helped and hope you get better. please do not hesitate to contact me for any further details. have a great day"

i just had a root canal yesterday and the temporary crown came of last night i called the dentist she said to come in monday to have it re-cemented . today it fell out when rinsing my mouth and the cap went down the drain . there no one in the office and wont be until monday,1,10813,"hi. welcome to chat doctor . i have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. as per your complaint if you have a temporary crown over your tooth since 2 weeks, and you still have pain it is not a normal finding and needs consultation with a dentist to rule out the cause of pain. as of now you can take advil [ibuprofen] for relieving pain rather that tylenol as advil is more effective in reducing pain and inflammation. i would like to give you additional information that if after 2 weeks also you have pain in the tooth with a temporary crown, you need to consult a dentist and get evaluated and also get an iop ar [x-ray] done to rule out the exact cause of pain. at times high points over the crown can be a cause of pain and trimming of the same can relieve the pain. other causes can be:if the tooth is root canal treated before crown placement there re-infection in the tooth can be a cause of pain and in that case removal of crown followed by repetition of root canal treatment followed by antibiotics and painkillers and replacement of crown will relieve. if root canal treatment was not done there is a possibility that while preparing the tooth to retain the crown there have been some nerve exposure and inflammation of nerve is causing pain. in this case root canal treatment has to be done after removing crown and then crown has to be replaced. hope this information helps. thanks and regards. chat doctor."

i just had a root canal yesterday and the temporary crown came of last night i called the dentist she said to come in monday to have it re-cemented . today it fell out when rinsing my mouth and the cap went down the drain . there no one in the office and wont be until monday,3,35390,hi. can understand your concern. as per your complaint you have got two crowns placed and pain after this can be due to either of the following reasons. one reason can be in case if the crowns were placed without root canal treatment of tooth (it is a treatment in which the nerves and blood vessels present in the tooth are cut off either to relieve pain due to infection or as an intentional procedure to avoid complications like pain and sensitivity after crown placement) the preparation of the tooth for seating the crown if done in excess can lead to opening of nerves and when the crown is placed over opened nerves it can cause inflammation of nerve and hence severe pain. in case if the crowns are placed after root canal treatment for an infected tooth pain can be due to persistent infection leading to pus formation and pressure which is not subsided or there is some vital nerve tissue left out in any missed root canal can cause severe pain on crown placement. i would suggest you to consult an endodontist and get evaluated clinically as well as by getting x-ray done to rule out the cause of pain. in case if root canal is not done and pain is due to irritated nerves the crown needs to be removed followed by root canal treatment and medicines and once pain is completely subsided crown can be placed again. in case of root canal treated tooth also re treatment will have to be done. you can take painkiller like eugenic plus or retool dt (one tablet dissolved in half a glass of water) to provide relief. hope your query is solved. if you find the answer helpful please write a positive review and click on find this answer helpful as a token of appreciation. thanks and regards. chat doctor.

first when i started to swallow something on my throat and had anything it used to cause a lot of pain for like 15 to 20 mind then it used to go . it used to carry on like this then i went to see my doctor he told me to have amoxilin tablet after having this it did reduce a bit of pain in my throat but now if i walk upstairs or walk my heart beats very fast and my throat pain comes back i would like to know why does this happen this is my first time and never experienced this problem.and by a way i am 45 yrs old,1,31327,"greetings. thank you for your question and welcome to chat doctor. i understand your concern. if this pain did not go away with your antibiotic therapy then probably it was not a sore throat. angina, pain originated by a blockage in your coronary arteries (arteries that encompass the heart as a crown, and ""feed"" it with oxygen and nutrients), usually manifests as a mid-chest pain radiating to the throat and left arm or shoulder. however, sometimes it can have atypical forms of manifesting and, since you have this sensation during carrying out physical activity, such as climbing stairs, my opinion is that you should have a cardiac check-up to, at least, exclude the cardiac origin of this pain. this is what i recommend you to do. first, to consult a cardiologist and have an ekg and an echocardiogram, to assess your heart electrical system and conduction system, and also assess the motility and function of heart chambers and valves. if seen appropriate, proceed further with a cardiac stress test, do more sensitively and specifically depict any problem in your coronary arteries. with your symptom, if the latter test comes back positive or inconclusive, then a coronary angiogram is appropriate, to assess if there are blockages in your coronary arteries and, if there are, to be treated as recommended. i hope i was helpful. take care and good luck. best regards,"

hi i have recently noticed i have an indent on my head i am 50 and the top of my head has always been smooth . the indent is about 4-6 inches long and about the width of a pencil . is this normal or should i have it checked . a was diagnosed with graves disease approx 3 years ago also . a am also having body aches/leg muscle tightness .,1,109733,thank you for the question. first off your doctor should have told why he said it was muscle wastage and what could have caused it. since i do not exactly know where the indent is i have a few suggestions1) hernia: this is a rare possibility but easy to rule out. just strip below your waist and lie back with your head under a pillow so that u can see the dent. put your hand on and around the dent and cough. if u feel a bulge it is probably a hernia2) neuromuscular disease: conditions like multiple sclerosis and als present as patch muscular atrophy which can result in such an indent. it is why perhaps your doctor told you to come back if it worsens. a head mri for ms is recommended3) normal: if you regularly exercise or walk or even use your right leg more this could result in an indent due to loss of fat in that area. in this case you have nothing to worry about. however since you do have dull pain i suspect sciatica with lumbar spondylosis in which case an mri is required

by mother is on oxygen and has congestive heart failure . does people with 20 % heart functioning usually have to go on oxygen or could there be other problems with her . the can barely get around without getting out of breath . oxygen is the only thing that seems to help her .,1,31373,"hello. welcome to chat doctor, and thank you for your question. i carefully read your query. supplemental oxygen always helps in congestive heart failure patients. some of these patients need it with higher percentages of ejection fraction and some with lower. a congestive heart failure patient with a 20% function of the left ventricle is advised to be confined only to every-day duties and not various strains of a healthy heart or a slightly decreased heart function. a 20% functioning heart means that 80% of its content remains in the left ventricle (normal being 30-45%) in every cardiac cycle. this means that blood coming from the pulmonary circulation does not have space to empty, and all of this is interpreted as a raised pressure in this circulation. this produces fluid build up in lungs and difficulty to breath (dyspnea). therefore, the lower the heart function percentage, the higher and the more often the need for supplemental oxygen. besides oxygen, a good support to lowering the above-mentioned pulmonary circulation high pressure, are the diuretics, and in these figures, i would recommend a loop diuretic and a potassium-sparing diuretic to her therapy. no salt should be used in her diet, whatsoever, because it retains the water and further raises the pulmonary pressure. i hope i was helpful with my answer. take care. best regards,"

i want to get pregnant and am trying to conceive since 6 months my cycle is 35 to 40 days before i get my periods my breast is very painful to touch please suggest me and wen is the best time to intercoursethanks akkimy age is 26 weight 5 2 '' weight 57,3,12366,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, i want to reassure you that it commonly can take up to a year from healthy couples to conceive. you are not diagnosed as infertile unless you and your husband have been trying to conceive (which means having unprotected intercourse at least two or three days a week) for at least a year. folic acid is a b vitamin that does not help you to get pregnant, however it is recommended to take during early pregnancy because it helps prevent birth defects. siphene, also known as camphene citrate, is a fertility medication. it can help induce ovulation in women who are infertile because they do not ovulate. however, if your periods normally come every month, there is no reason to suspect that you are not ovulating. because you are under the age of 35, i recommend that you and your husband to not take any more fertility medications and try to conceive for another six months on your own. normally, your most fertile time is between the time your period stops until you start to feel premenstrual symptoms. for most couples, that means having sex every other day from about the seventh day of your cycle until the 23rd to 25th day. if you and your husband have not conceived in another six months, i recommend both of you see fertility specialist, as 50% of the time lack of pregnancy can be a problem with the men sperm as well. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful, and you and your husband are able to have a baby soon. best wishes,"

a would like to know if someone had sex on tuesday night january 18 and used a condom but it broke and they were suppose to get there period on wednesday january 19th and then on friday january 20th they say they took a pregnancy test and they are pregnant is that accurate ?,1,35387,"hallow dear, due date of delivery is calculated as 9 months and 7 days from the last menstrual period date. you had intercourse on january 10 meaning thereby that the egg release and conception has taken place on 10 january. thus, if you had your conception around january 10, your probable date of menstruation would be 14 - 16 days prior to that as the egg release takes place 14 days prior to the next menses. so let me presume that your menses were on 26 december. then in that case, the due date would be 2 october. this day happens to be 26 december + 9 months + 7 days. 21 oct is projected by ultrasound. ultrasound measures the period of gestation as per the size of the baby and hence is supposed to be more accurate. it differs from the due date calculated by lmp by a week or so. i hope this clarifies the dilemma in your mind."

"i have had a lump in my lower left rib area with pain upon touch for about 15 years , now live noticed its started to get larger and i have been catching every cold or virus that goes around , which is unusual for me . any ideas ? a have had some lower back pain at the same time",1,44715,"hello, i can understand your concern. it would have been helpful if you had mentioned which tooth was treated for root canal. as you are mentioning that the tooth was black and had cracks in it, i am assuming that the tooth is in the lower front region, and you had had some trauma to the lower jaw area which made the tooth dead and also hurt the chin and lip. other possibility is that if the tooth was dead for many years, it may have developed a periapical cyst in relation with the tooth which might be pressing on the mental nerve supplying lower lip and chin and may cause numbness of those areas. alternatively, the numbness may have started after taking local anesthesia in the lower front area for some tooth problem and the injection might have been given deep. in any case, it seems that the nerve supplying sensation to the lower front area of jaw along with lower lip and chin (mental nerve) is damaged. usually, if the nerve is damaged, it can regenerate in 3-6 months and the sensations can return. if you are not sure regarding the crown on the tooth, you can avoid it for some months and take care not to bite hard things with that tooth so that it does not fracture. you can get the crown after the numbness is solved. i would also advise you to visit an oral and maxillofacial surgeon for the examination of the area and regarding numbness. he/she might take an x-ray to rule out presence of periapical lesion or cyst in relation with the tooth. crown should surely be postponed until this possibility is ruled out. i hope this information helps you. thank you for choosing chat doctor. i wish you feel better soon. best,"

"by son ( 9 ) has had trouble with nighttime dryness . be have tried to limit liquids , waking him up in the middle of the night to void , and now have an alarm he wears but nothing works . a am getting worried that he will not outgrow this issue as his paediatrician says . a am wondering if a should seek a of to see if there is an infection and blood work to see if there is an underlying issue . thanks",1,47037,"hi there, if he is still having fevers and lethargic, i'd be worried that one of his grafts were infected. sometimes, it takes many weeks or even months to get over a major surgery, but he should start to improve and not decline. blood cultures would be the first place to start, as if he has blood cultures that show infection, i'd be very worried that his arterial grafts were infected. if he has negative blood cultures, that is more reassuring. if his incision is getting better, that's certainly a good sign. i would have a straight forward conversation with the surgeon who did the surgery and ask him why your husband hadn't fully recovered, and what his expectation for his recovery should be. if he's not eating well and having pain, then there are certain things that can be due such as a nasogastric feeding tube, or perhaps even iv nutrition. if he's having pain issues, then he should refer him to a chronic pain doctor. and finally, if he's having fevers, i'd ask the surgeon if he has an infection of the grafts, and if he says no, i'd ask him where he thought the fevers were coming from this far out of surgery. in this case, it sounds like you really have to push your surgeon for answers. no one will know the answers to these questions unless it's the surgeon who did the operation, who should be following him closely. i hope this is helpful. please contact me if you have any further questions."

"hello , a am a 63 year old female with trial each and only one kidney , asthma and copd . a now have several masses on my right lung and am having a vat biopsy tomorrow . a was told a have to be in intensive care for two days with a hospital stay of 5 - 7 days .... is that normal procedure . pm terrified .",1,31510,"brief answer:vat biopsy is the best and less invasive approach to take a biopsy of the lung masses and discover their nature. detailed answer:hello, thank you for using chat doctor. at this point, after being detected the lung masses, the best approach to them is to undergo the biopsy through vat(video assisted thoracoscopy). the scope can be inserted into the chest through small 2-4 cm incisions made between the ribs. it allows the surgeon to view, under high magnification, the lung masses and manipulate the instruments to effectively transect and remove the tissue from the body. compared to thoracotomy (traditional, opened procedure), vats is minimally invasive, with less pain, smaller incision, fewer days of hospitalization (generally at about 3-4 days). as you suffer from atrial tachycardia and having only one kidney, asthma and copd you need a more accurate medical care. the lung function, in your case, needs a longer time to recover comparing to a healthy lung. this means you may need a more long hospital stay, but you should understand this is the best choice in your conditions. hope this is helpful. let me know if you need more clarifications. otherwise, please close and rate the answer. kind"

by boyfriend was having back problems from what his or told him a year ago was herniated disc and sciatica . last week he started complaining about having numbness and tingling and then erectile dysfunction . be took him to e.r . they did an mri and back exam and did to see the herniated disc and told him he was otherwise healthy to follow up with neurologist . be can to get an appointment for 3 weeks and is now panicking thinking that the has developed multiple sclerosis . a think he a panicking and having breathing problems . would to multiple sclerosis be detected on the mri ?,1,77239,"hi there. looks like your son with the prior history of pain over the far right side of back and difficulty in standing up has developed a spasm of the back muscle. these muscle spasms need not be always related to what the affected individual was doing at the time of having the onset of pain, but can be related to any abnormal posturing such as bending for a long time prior to the onset of the pain which would have fatigued his back muscles. the pop sound he heard or felt could be probably a disc problem that may lead to a secondary spasm, so if he is having a persisting pain radiating to the right side alone and not subsiding with rest and pain medications, kindly get an mri scan of the spine and get him evaluated. so in the acute setting a few days of bed rest, local analgesic ointment, a 3-day course of tramadol should be enough. in case of pain radiating down the leg or the hip, or any weakness of lower limb on one side, get additional scans and get him checked."

painful pain in the left of chest around the end of the rib cage . homes and goes . hurts when breath too deeply and when the pain is there is gets worse laying on the left side but laying on the right has no pain . is this related to my stomach ? because my stomach forms weird sound when a push it out and in ...,1,41649,"hello. thank you for your question and welcome to chat doctor. i understand your concern. well, i am going to try and explain the differences between various origins of the pain which can arise from the rib cage. there is angina. it is described more like mid-chest heaviness or squeezing sensation, that is triggered by exercise and relieved by rest, which radiates to the both sides of the chest, to the jaw and left arm and shoulder. it is indicative of a blockage within one or more coronary arteries and reflects the lowering of blood supply to the heart muscle. an ekg obtained in the moment of chest pain, if it fills this description, would be helpful. then there is pleuritic chest pain. this kind of pain is sharp, stabbing pain that can happen in any part of the chest area. no radiation like in anginal pain. it arises from acute or chronic inflammation of the linings that are within the rib cage: pleura (lining of the lungs) or pericardium (lining of the heart) or both. in this regard, i would recommend a chest x-ray for pleural inflammation or effusion. in case of pericardial pain and anginal pain, echocardiogram is helpful, by evaluating the size, motility and function of heart muscle and valves, and also by assessing the pericardium and whether there is fluid build-up within it, or not. other causes of chest pain are related to the locomotion system of the rib cage: muscle soreness, bone and cartilage-related pain. in the end, stress can also cause chest pain. i hope i was helpful with my answer. best regards,"

"i , my 14th month daughter has been slightly constipated lately and really seems to struggle going and when she does the easiest way of describing them is that they look like nuggets ! they are also very pale sort of yellow/beige is this normal ? the a had green poo for ages and a be started to give her more cow a milk and none of her formula milk , is this what could have affected her stools ? thanks",1,33660,"hi there, the backed up stool and tendency to urinary tract infection does point to the idea that she could be constipated, despite being regular. regarding the frequency of bowel movements, do note that different people tend to have different bowel needs, up to 3 times a day is accepted as normal. so she could actually be going daily and still be relatively constipated. what we are aiming for is the right consistency of stools, which is long and sausage-like, with or without cracks. if you need more visual guidance, look for the bristol stool chart online, and aim for type 3 or 4. it is good that she is taking enough fibers, but also pay attention to her habits and stress to her that she needs to go when she feels like it even if it is more than once a day. constipation often occurs at this age because this is when they are getting better at holding it in, and prefer other exciting activities to sitting in the toilet. the other rarer possibility would be that she has a mild form of hirschsprungs disease, which means that some nerves are missing from the end of the colon, making the evacuating of stool difficult. most people have this diagnosed as babies, but if its very mild it can be missed. it might be more likely if she had delayed bowel movement more than a day after birth, or had tendency to constipation even as a baby. you will have to discuss with your doctor on this possibility, because confirmation would be needed with a rectal biopsy. hope this helps, and all the best to you."

"very sore left leg where verrucous veins are . main left there and started in the chest , oesophagus and went up into the jaw . now all pain is gone except for some pain in the upper back between shoulder blades . feeling very worn out and tired . would this be associated with the heart . other died of hardening of the arteries email address is yyyy @ yyyy",1,44855,"greetings. welcome to chat doctor, and thank you for your question. i understand your concern. your age would help me a lot in constructing a differential diagnosis. however, i will explain some forms of chest pain, which we aim to exclude first, as the main and most dangerous organic causes of it. first, there is angina. angina is a moderate-to-severe chest pain, more characterized like a heaviness or tenderness or ""squeezing"" feeling, localized in the mid-chest, and then radiates to the both sides of the chest, the jaw, left shoulder and left arm. this is the pain originated from one or more blockages within the coronary arteries (arteries that supply the heart muscle with oxygen and nutrients). if this is your case, you should perform an ekg and an echocardiogram, and, depending on these two tests, a cardiac stress test. second, there is sharp, stabbing pain. this kind of pain can come from an enlargement of the root of the aorta and/or from aortic aneurysm. it is severe in intensity, and radiates to the back, between the wings. also, it can be caused by an acute or chronic inflammation to the linings within the rib cage, i.e. the pleura (lining of the lungs) and pericardium (the lining of the heart). this kind of pain - pleuritic pain - is less severe than that caused by aortic aneurysm, and relieves or aggravates from switching positions or the respiratory cycle. if this is the case, then echocardiogram (for pericardium and root of the aorta), chest x-ray (for the pleura and the lungs), and computed tomography of the aorta (in case we suspect that there is a problem with the aorta, higher than its root), should be performed. there is always a possibility of intercostal (between ribs) muscle or pectoral (chest) muscle soreness, and pain originated from problems with ribs and rib joints. if this is the case, you can use over the counter painkillers. i hope i was thorough with my answer. best regards."

(regular use of emergency pill is harmful)conception occurs if she was in 10th to 18th day of her cycle(in a regular cycle of 28 day duration). you can ask her at what day she is in and wait for next cycle to occur. if it delayed by 7 days then get done upt to diagnose if pregnant and then the required treatment can be taken. regards"

hello . a have not been feeling well for a couple of days now .... sore throat and really weak . today my body feels like pins and needles . a am short of breath and it feels like my heart is pounding . almost hypersensitive .... should a go to the hospital ?,1,36160,hi. thanks for your query and an elucidated history. the lump at the back of the neck can not cause a direct problem of pins and needles in the arm. it is possible that the muscle spasm caused by this lump can indirectly cause nerve pressure or pinching. get fnac done of the lump and the mri should have been done to see if there is a protruding disc causing pressure on the spinal cord which causes the pins and needles feeling in the upper limb as you have. it is wise to get an opinion f a surgeon for the lump and of the neurologist for pins and needles sensation in the arm.
hello . a have not been feeling well for a couple of days now .... sore throat and really weak . today my body feels like pins and needles . a am short of breath and it feels like my heart is pounding . almost hypersensitive .... should a go to the hospital ?,2,63527,"hello, and i hope i help you today. sir, the white blood cells (called pus) and blood in your wives urine are an indication that she has a kidney infection. it is important that she takes all medicine prescribed by her doctor as a kidney infection sometimes needs to be treated in the hospital to prevent complications with her and the babies health. an infection of the urinary tract is not sexually transmitted and is not contagious to you or any household contacts. again though i want to emphasize that it is important for your wife to take antibiotics prescribed by her doctor as directed, and please bring her to the hospital if she develops a fever or feels weak or short of breath. i hope that i was adequately answer your question today and that your wife gets the medical care she needs. best wishes,"
hello . a have not been feeling well for a couple of days now .... sore throat and really weak . today my body feels like pins and needles . a am short of breath and it feels like my heart is pounding . almost hypersensitive .... should a go to the hospital ?,3,15046,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. feeling short of breath is not unusual while you're pregnant because the hormones of pregnancy actually have a way of telling your brain to breathe faster. this is to ensure that your baby gets enough oxygen, because as your belly gets bigger your lungs are not able to expand as well. so many women feel the sensation of needing to catch their breath all the time when they breathe when they are in the third trimester. in addition, because you would have been on bed rest for so long, you probably are not in very good cardiovascular shape. another possible reason why you could be feeling short of breath is that there is a possibility that you are anemic. normally, as part of routine prenatal care we check your blood count as well is a test for gestational diabetes somewhere between 24 and 28 weeks. if you've not yet had this test, it might be a good idea to mention your symptoms to your doctor. of course, there can be some serious, dangerous things that can cause shortness of breath; like blood clots that spread to your lung, or fluid in the lungs and other pulmonary problems. if you experience any chest pain or severe shortness of breath or start developing a productive cough, you should notify your doctor immediately and possibly go to the hospital for evaluation. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

"me and my boyfriend have unprotected sex and when i had my period last month it only lasted 2 days with one day very bad cramping the same day my period stopped , we took a home pregnancy test and it came out negative , now its been a week or two since my period and in spotting with lower right abdominal pain headaches and menstrual cramps could it be a ectopic pregnancy ?",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"a have had a my and during my brain surgery they discovered another small bleed deep in my brain ... this was in an of this year .... in aug a discovered new symptoms that are very concerning to me and none of my doctors can tell me what a wrong or how to fix it ... a experience headaches everyday , shaking , fast pounding heart feels like its coming out of my chest , heart rate is always in the 100 a , sweating a lot during episodes , nauseous , dizziness , face twitching ... etc the list of symptoms go on ....",1,95688,"hello, im very sorry to hear about your friends stroke. here is some information relation to hemorrhagic strokes (brain bleeds).first, brain bleeds can happen for different reasons such as a head injury (traumatic), a rupture of an aneurysm and bleed within the brain matter itself (parenchymal hemorrhage). it is very important in your friends' case to determine what caused his bleed. given his fevers any infections need to be ruled out and an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) should be done to rule out any sort of infection of the heart valves which could send bacteria to the brain which could result in a bleed. he absolutely needs to have blood vessel imaging in the form of either a ct angiogram and mr angiogram to make sure that there are no abnormal collections of blood vessels in the brain and aneurysms that could have cause the bleed. also, when there is a bleed in the brain a tumor must also be ruled out. all that being said, the most common cause of a bleed in the brain is due to high blood pressure which causes weakening of blood vessels and can result in a hemorrhage. most commonly management of brain hemorrhages is supportive, meaning that the only things that are done is blood pressure control, pain management and if the person is unconscious then support for breathing. if the bleed is very large then surgical intervention may be necessary. what the doctors are saying as that they want to repeat a ct scan to see if the bleed has become larger, which can sometimes happen. there are several risk factors for the bleed worsening: one is poor blood pressure control, another is if there is an underlying aneurysm or blood vessel that could bleed. that's why it is so important to determine what caused the bleed. for small bleeds with no underlying vascular or malignant pathology the outcome is typically fairly good. the blood causes irritation and pressure on the surrounding brain causing weakness and neurological symptoms, but as the blood subsides the symptoms improve and sometimes there may be a remarkable improvement. the language area of the brain is very delicate, and it is hard to predict how well he will recover, but my best educated guess is that he will recover at least some language function and could even recover close to how he was though probably never quite back to level his language was before the bleed. it sounds like he is doing relatively well overall since he is able to go to the restroom without support, so that is an encouraging sign. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"i a just have a quick question , so a a suppose to be starting my period within this past week , well my husband came inside of me the other night and then yesterday a felt my regular period cramps so a put a tampon in , but when a took it out there was only a drop of blood on it and today when a took it out it was clean ! ! to do you think that a could be pregnant cause a was more fertile because a took the morning after pill the next day . would the pill make me spot ? and how soon can a find out if a am pregnant ?",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

''",2,5256,"hi, how are you? my name is chat doctor. thanks for writing to chat doctor and i hope to answer your question today. hepatitis c virus, as i am sure you are aware, damages the liver cells. the liver has an enormous capacity to regenerate, meaning if part of the liver is damaged, then new liver cells are formed to replace the damaged liver (unlike skin where damaged skin is replaced by scar). the problem with hepatitis c is, it is present constantly in the blood and liver and continues to damage the liver continuously. just like a rubber band can be stretched only so far before it snaps, so is the regenerative capacity of the liver. depending on how virulent the hepatitis c strain is, over the course of 10-30 yrs, the liver exhausts its capacity to regenerate and just like skin, the damaged liver cells starts getting replaced by scar tissue - this leads to hardening of the normal supple liver - a condition known as liver fibrosis which later on leads to liver cirrhosis. the problem with this is, under normal circumstances anywhere between 1200 and 1500 ml of blood flows through the liver per min. when the liver is normal and supple, this blood can flow easily through the liver. but when the liver begins to stiffen or harden as in the case of cirrhosis, this blood is met with great resistance during its flow through the liver. this is called as ""portal hypertension"". so the blood starts to look for alternate routes to return to the heart and the most accessible route for it is through the veins of the food pipe (esophagus and stomach). the problem with this is, the veins in the esophagus and stomach are very thin walled and are not used to carrying this much volume of blood. so they distend to a great degree (a condition called as varices) and sometime even rupture with catastrophic consequences. this is easily diagnosed by upper gi endoscopy where the largely dilated veins can be seen. but in your case, since multiple upper gi endoscopies have not demonstrated any varices, it means your liver has not reached a state of ""portal hypertension"" yet and the disease seems not be progressing or is ""stable"". if i was your doctor, i would also get a ""fibrosis"" which is a special scan of the liver to look at the amount of stiffness or hardening of the liver. this can be repeated regularly to see the progression of the fibrosis. i would also explore the different treatments for hepatitis c infection. the gold standard is of course a liver biopsy which will demonstrate the exact status of your liver. i hope this helped, and i do hope you will get better soon. please write back to me if you need any further clarifications especially the treatment options available to treat hepatitis c. have a great day"

"i , i have a huge problem .. i had sex 4 days ago and didst realize that the condom was left inside of me .. i just went to the bathroom and i peed it out ; ( i know its too late for plan a because more than 72 hours passed and in really scared ... i hope there was no sperm in the condom ! !",1,95340,"hi, i understand your concern and your problem. this may happen in the following scenarios. 1. the nova ring is broken; sometimes the joint of the ring is broken, so it may not regain back its desired shape once inside the vagina and slips out. in this case try a new ring.2. the vagina is lax and roomy. sometimes vaginal laxity may interfere with holding the ring in place, this is very rare and unless the vagina is too lax, it does not slip.3. ring not pushed far enough; sometimes women do not push it far enough inside so that it remains at the vaginal opening and slips out. the first and third are common likely causes. check to see if any of this is happening to you. if the ring is broken use a new one and use some other method like condom for next 7 days. if you are scared to push it in, i want to reassure you that don't be afraid. this ring is safe and will not go anywhere other than the vagina. it does not cause any trauma, so it is safe. just push it way inside, so it will not slip. the best position to do this is lying down and slowly pushing it inside towards your buttocks that is backwards. a tilted uterus will not affect the position of the ring and neither will it have any effect on its insertion. another word of caution is that if the ring has been lying outside for more than 3 hours, use another method like condom for the next seven days after correctly inserting the ring. hope i was able to help you, thank you for using chat doctor and have a nice day."

"key doc , a a a 57 yr. old male in good health . a be been suffering with numbness footprint for several years now . but just recently a a experiencing severe pain and inflammation in the ball of my right foot . a a also unable to ball my foot . a just started to apply ice to it . that should a do ? ? note : by uric acid level was 1 point higher than the max threshold . thanks",1,91875,"foot pain is extremely common and can be pretty uncomfortable. since your foot pain comes after long periods of inactivity like getting up in the morning or after having been off your feet for some time, it is likely from a combination of muscle tightness and tendonitis. tendons are the structures that connect muscle to bone to help joints move. you have tendons on the inside and outside your foot to help your foot move and to keep your foot stable. these tendons can become inflamed in some situations of overuse or other situations where they are being overworked. the mainstay of treatment for tendonitis is ice(20 min 4 times a day) and anti-inflammatories. in addition, i like to recommend a combination of soft tissue treatments and exercises for the foot. you can use a lacrosse ball on the bottom and sides of your feet to work out tight areas. you can then follow by strengthening the foot by grabbing a towel using your toes and the releasing and repeating for 3 sets of 10 twice a day. if you continue to have pain, i recommend x-rays to rule out other causes and an examination by a specialist."

a have lose tissue damage towards the back of my mouth and it been feeling sore that when a found a white spot that looks like it has a hole in it or a rip on my gum near the tissue damage at first a thought it was a canker sore which a been using medication on it but its not working its getting worse what can this be,1,86792,"dear sir/ mam, i understand your problem. always when a tooth erupts, the tissue surrounding it will get swollen and become a bit red. then the teeth tear the gums and comes out. the gum tissue above the tooth will be always very loose until the tootchatdoctores out completely into mouth. this loose gum tissue allows food accumulation under it and it's difficult to clean. this may cause infection and pain in the gum tissue. so already swollen gum tissue now become even worse. the opposite teeth will now bite on this tissue. so first treatment option is to cut the loose tissue above the erupting wisdom teeth. its very simple procedure of 2 minutes. if the problem recur, then take an x-ray and assess whether the wisdom tooth is in proper angulation to come out into the mouth. if the space in the jawbone is not enough and if the orientation of wisdom tooth is not good, it cannot come out. it may damage the adjacent teeth also in that condition. so better to take it off. you can normally chew even without wisdom teeth. so no need to worry. hope your query is answered. please don't hesitate to contact be back for further doubts."

"my blood pressure has been going up continuously over the past month . i have began a regular cardio routine , and yet it goes up . at what point should i go to the hospital . today it is 152/100 . i have been to my or this week who put me on exercise diet , and to the cardiologist for stress test which i did well on . what are they missing ?",1,8772,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the proper way to use the nearing is to put it in, leave it in for 3 weeks, take it out, wait one week, and replace it. during the week you are not wearing the ring, you should have some bleeding that is considered a menstrual cycle. if you wore the ring continuously for two months and then had a new one replaced but only removed it 3 days later, the pinkish spotting was your ""period"", which is caused by not wearing the ring. the bleeding was very light because you had suppressed it by continuously wearing the ring for over 2 months. so you should expect your next period about 4-5 weeks after the episode of spotting that you had. if you do not have menses by then, i recommend repeating the pregnancy test at that time. if you did not have regular monthly cycles before you used the ring, your cycle will follow your regular pattern that you typically have when not using hormonal contraception. if you are trying to get pregnant, you should have intercourse about every other day and begin taking prenatal vitamins as it benefits the health of the baby for the vitamins to be present at conception. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"please could someone advise me . it is now 11 weeks post chemo for breast cancer . by liver function tests ast is 84u/l and alt is 126u/l , they have climbed from ast 44 and alt 60 taken 6weeks ago . a also have some mild discomfort in my liver area . would this be due to the post chemo affect on my liver ? susan",1,28200,"hi, i had gone through your question and understand your concerns. firstly, i must stress that one or a few of the liver function tests should not be interpreted in isolation. the entire hepatic function panel should be ideally be available along with the normal laboratory reference ranges for a meaningful interpretation. you have provided only the ast and alt values. therefore, i can only answer in general terms. serum aminotransferases: are of two types.- alpine aminotransferase (alt) and- aspartame aminotransferase (ast). elevations of these are the two of the most useful indicators of liver cell injury. the ast is less live specific than the alt. elevations of the ast level may also be seen in acute muscle injury, (cardiac or skeletal muscle). mild degrees of alt level elevation may occasionally be seen in skeletal muscle injury or even after vigorous physical exercise. disproportionate elevations of the ast and alt levels when compared with the alkaline phosphatase level arise in diseases that primarily affect hepatocytes (ex; viral hepatitis). the ast/alt ratio is not very useful in determining the cause of liver injury, except in acute alcoholic hepatitis, wherein, the ratio is usually > 2 and the ast level is 400 iu/ml or lower. common causes of mild increases in ast and alt levels is fatty liver disease seen most often in the context of obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and alcohol abuse. the ratio of ast to alt may give additional clues as to the cause:- in chronic liver disease with early cirrhosis alt > ast,- in chronic liver disease with established cirrhosis ast > alt. extremes of the ratio of ast:alt may also be sometimes useful:- ratio >2 suggests alcoholic hepatitis, and-do not worry. it will take around 6 months for the enzymes to be normal again. hope this answers your question. if you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. i will be happy to answer your questions. wishing your daughters good health."

"my name is diya,25 yrs of age 5 '' 3 and weigh 50kg which i got a tiny wound on my feet by my pug and she was only 4mths which anti rabies vaccination was not given and i do have a doubt whether it licked my feet so i met up with the doctor so he asked me to go ahead with of and also 5 dosage of jaipur so i had undergone so i just want to know whether this has any side effects and also in future will it increase my body weight",1,13626,"hello, welcome to chat doctor. thanks for writing. i am chat doctor. i have read your question completely, i understand your concern and will try to help you in the best way possible. the post exposure prophylaxis of rabies depend upon the degree of exposure, and the prophylactic measures may vary from simple antirabies vaccines to the use of passive immunity, in the form of anti-rabies serum or immunoglobulins, but since rabies is a potentially fatal disease and its post exposure vaccination have shown to be having almost 99.9% efficacy, so normally doctors don't recommend taking chances, so even for trivial scratches the vaccinations are suggested quite often. but in your case, since dog is well vaccinated, and since you know the vaccination status of the dog, then it must be, a pet dog likely. so it would be still encouraging if you reconfirm the exact booster dosages and whether the vaccines schedule was followed, as per protocol. if dog is available, it can be examined by a vet to reconfirm whether it has any signs and symptoms of rabies? also, the history that, whether it was a provoked bite or spontaneously unprovoked incidence is very important, in case of stray dogs mostly. the kind of wound you inflicted is a category 2 wound, which needs rabies vaccination normally, without any need of antirabies serum. but since dog is well vaccinated as you have described’t hen need of vaccination declines. i would still suggest you, that even if there is a little of ambiguity, regarding the dogs' status, you can start anti rabies vaccination according to regular schedule of day 0,3,7 and 21. and meanwhile god can be kept under monitoring. if the dog doesn't show any kind of symptoms in 10 days, then the vaccination can be stopped. i hope this answered your question. if you have more queries i am happy to answer.otherwise, rate and close the discussionregrads."

a have a had a reoocureinggroin injury because of soccer . a have played on it recently an it fees fine while running but it bothers me when a am laying down and sitting down . it is a dull pinching feeling . it also seems if a over stretched it would tear ? yyyy @ yyyy,1,107362,"here it can be related with frozen shoulder or shoulder joint soft tissue damage, as well you also have mention protrusion over the shoulder joint. i want to know this protrusion is recently started or it's there from birth as well is it present even when your hand is down resting and there is no movement in shoulder joint. or it comes only while moving your hand up with shoulder movement. if it is there from birth and even at resting position then its normal but if it comes only while moving hand up along with shoulder then its biomechanics of joint which is affected and so that you are feeling it as shoulder protrusion. here one more symptoms you have given is bone tightness at shoulder. it can be due to less movement also. so the surrounding soft tissues have become tight. i suggest visiting or tho or physio doctor get it examine properly if needed they may ask for mri scan. and based on diagnosis if there is mild to moderate issue that will get over with physio treatment and exercises suggestion. if there is major damage to soft tissue or joint capsule then you may need surgical correction and then again physiotherapy treatment for further healing and rehabilitation. you can also use hot and cold pack over your shoulder painful area for further pain relief. i am sure you will recover soon if you follow all above given steps. take care."

"hi my son has a bilirubin count of 37 , they have done numerous blood test , 2 ultrasounds and a cat scan , and can not find anything wrong other then the bilirubin elevation and he is extremely jaundice . be are awaiting a biopsy , this week sometime , and are trying to figure out what sort of diet he should be following at this time .",1,65018,"hi thanks for the question. i assume that your baby is more than a week old. most of the babies have yellow discoloration of skin and sclera during the first few days of life. this is called physiological jaundice, and it subsides on its own without any intervention. this is a normal phenomenon as a result of transition from fetal to extrauterine life. you should be aware when jaundice is a cause of concern: 1. if jaundice appears on first day of life2. if the level of bilirubin is more than 12 mg/dl. bilirubin is the substance that causes the yellow coloration of skin. its level can be checked with a blood test .3. if the rise in bilirubin level is more than 5 mg/dl/hr. for this your doctor my prescribe repeated test and then plot the levels on a graph to predict the expected rise in bilirubin.4. if direct bilirubin is more the 2 mg/dl or 20% of the total. bilirubin is of two types physiological jaundice is due to the water insoluble indirect bilirubin so if direct component is high it means it's not physiological and should be a cause for concern. the direct and indirect breakage is given in the blood test. 5. if your baby is otherwise unwell e.g. is lethargic, is not feeding well, has fever or difficulty breathing then its not physiological jaundice because in that case your baby will be otherwise totally ok. you have asked if your baby needs incubator care. incubators are for premature babies who can not maintain their body temperatures as they have arrived earlier, and temperature control mechanisms have not yet been established. the incubator provides specific temperature. incubators are not used for the treatment of any type of jaundice. phototherapy is used for that. these are specially lights that convert the indirect water insoluble bilirubin into water soluble forms that can then be excreted out through urine. as i have told high levels of direct bilirubin are a cause of concern and these need treatment with a phototherapy unit. your doctor may prescribe phototherapy if your child has any of the criteria i have mentioned earlier, but incubator care is not needed as your baby is not premature and is at least older than a week. if you have any other questions i will be happy to answer."

is it still possible to be pregnant even if you `` think '' you have your period ? pm 25 and by breast are really sore and seem like they are bigger but my breast have never been sore throughout my cycle in my life . a got my expected period on wednesday nov 8th and its light . when can a take an accurate home pregnancy test ?,1,49266,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. if you last had your period on september 12th, and today is october 5th, your period is not yet late for october. most women have a 25-35 day cycle, so until you actually miss your period for october, there is no reason to assume you are pregnant. the folic acid and zinc you are taking are just extra vitamins that provide health to a growing pregnancy; these should not affect or change your menstrual cycle or its symptoms. if your period is late in october, you should purchase and perform an over-the-counter pregnancy test. modern pregnancy tests are very accurate and can be positive even 10 days after conception. if you do find out you are pregnant, there is nothing that needs to be done immediately as pregnancy is not a disease- it is a normal state for women in the reproductive phase of their lives. so it is important only to keep taking your vitamins, get plenty of rest, eat a balanced diet and avoid alcohol, caffeine and chat doctor. if your period is mate, but you are not pregnant, the delay in your cycle can have a number of causes, including hormonal imbalances, certain medical conditions like thyroid disease, and even the stress of worrying about pregnancy. if you miss more than 2 months of your cycle (no bleeding for 3 months) and your pregnancy test is negative, you should see a physician for a hormonal evaluation. so in summary, a late menstrual cycle can be caused by pregnancy, but there are other causes as well. i suggest you perform a pregnancy test if you are late, and if it is negative, try to be patient, and you will likely get it before another month goes by. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"
