i by 5 or old son has what looks like either broken blood vessels or a rash on his upper lip . ( looks like a juice stained moustache ) a tried to wipe it off but it is not a juice stain . the mark has remained on his lip over a day . to you know what this might be from and will it go away ? thank you !,1,6898,"hello and welcome, this sounds like a frustrating situation. the first thing that i thought of when reading your question is that your son needs to be seen in the doctor's office to truly evaluate that rash. while it is quite reasonable to have a medication such as statin prescribed over the phone, given the failure of it to clear up the rash, and that it is getting worse, and that you've tried for a week - it is time to take him in so the doctor can look at it and see what that rash truly is. regarding whether statin can make a rash worse (or cause one): the worsening of the rash may either be due to that statin is not the right medication to treat this rash, or that your son is sensitive or allergic to it. at this visit the doctor can explain the significance of his low white blood count and whether this might be related to the persistence or worsening of his rash. she will be able to tell what specific cell types of the white blood count are low. i hope this helps you. best wishes to you and your son."

"by question is -- sometimes a can feel my heartbeat hurt a little beat . with each beat , it is a very faint , but noticeable pain . that could this be ? its not always , just once in a while . a can feel it in the center of me ( where my heart is ) and in my back some , too .",1,25338,"hello and thank you for using chat doctor. i carefully read your question and understand your concern. but you should not worry, its nothing serious. as you describe, my opinion is that it might be a rhythm issue. someone can feel strong and fast heart beats for different reasons. it may be a simple sinus tachycardia. this means that the heart is beating faster than 100 beats for minute. its normal range in a resting condition is between 60-100 beats for minute. when it goes up you may feel a strong heart beat in your chest and a sensation like your body is beating too. another reason for this sensation might be what we call an ekstrasystol.these is electrical heart impulses that generates in some parts of heart different from normal sinus rhythm. this generates an escaped beat that the person feels like jumping ore bumping. it gives the sensation like a beat is skipping, may experience palpitations or an anxiety sensation that your daughter explains like trembling. this extrasistoles may happen from different reasons from simple emotional stress to other pathologies like anemia, hyperthyroidism etc. so, my opinion as cardiologist is that you have nothing to worry. it is just a simple episode, and it is quite normal in younger ages. only if these symptoms persist and begins to interfere the daily live, if i was your treating doctor i will recommend some examinations like a blood analysis to exclude anemia, the thyroid hormones, an electrocardiogram, echocardiography and of course a holder monitoring. this will help us to document and see what happens with heart rhythm. at meantime, i will recommend your daughter to avoid coffee, caffeine products because they rise heart frequency and extrasistolic beats. i encourage her to have physical training because sometimes it helps in reducing extrasistoles, tachycardia, even making them disappear. wish i was helpful. take good care. best regards"

"hello , doctor ! of a may ask , is there any danger of overdosing on a birth control pill ? a took 4 today to catch up . a have pcos and my doctor advised me to take diane35 .",2,27194,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. tri-sprintec is a birth control pill that has a traffic regimen; which means that each color pill in the package has a slightly different dose of hormones. occasionally, women who take traffic pills may have some spotting in the first few days after each pill strength changes over the course of the month. this may cause some slight bleeding or spotting when were not supposed to have your period. whenever you had vaginal bleeding, regardless of the cause, usually there is some cramping that accompanies it. furthermore, it is not unusual to have irregular bleeding or spotting in the first 3 months of pill use. both sprinter and tri-sprintec are considered low-dose birth control pills, however there are many brands on the market that have a lower dose of estrogen than the pill you are currently taking. so you may have less irregular bleeding and spotting on a different kind of monophasic (same dose all month) birth control pill. regarding pregnancy, the chance of your conceiving while taking birth control pills and using a condom is basically nonexistent. so i believe the symptoms you were experiencing are side effects due to the new birth control pill. if your desire is for lighter, regular periods, a different brand of monophasic pill may work better for you with fewer side effects. i hope i was able to adequately answer questions today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"a have noticed a loss of skin pigment on my genitals . one dime-nickel sized spot on the shaft , perfectly round and another spot at the base of the shaft leading onto my left testicle . a am 29 years old . a would like to know what is causing this and if it is in any way harmful to my health .",1,98903,"hi, thanks for writing in. the direction of urination if temporarily towards one particular side after having sex is a normal occurrence. it is possible that your penile muscles are still in erect stage and therefore the penis is deviated at an angle to one side. this is perfectly normal and not a concern. with the erect penis, the urethra is also deviated to the same side as it is located in the center of penile shaft. when you wish to urinate after sex, you can hold the shaft of penis lightly with your hand and then shoot to the toilet. this will direct the stream of urine forwards and avoid any spillage outside."

"i , my mother age 51 was diagnosed with pneumonia in the right lung.she was hospitalised for 5 days on antibiotics.she came home.pain at the back was gone.only thing she struggling with is coughing , fatigue , decreased appetite , short of breath.what can be wrong with her ? sputum was send away came back negative.no blood when she coughs .",3,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

i have 2 white spots in my mouth 1 is size of a small pin head ( very small ) other one is a thin small line at the bottom of my gum line.no pain.im 48yrs old 5ft 3 and about 160lbs .. healthy except i get nigrines.i have been told by the dentist live had gingivitis and i have receding gums .. a deal with lot of stress daily,1,1167,"hi i had gone through your problem. already you had been told that you have gum problems i.e., gingivitis and receding gums. these problems will not cause white spots on the gums, which are painless. second thing and important thing in your query is you deal with a lot of stress daily. because of that stress some kind of white spots which are pain less, may form not only on the gums but also on the entire mucosa of the oral cavity. i strongly suspect that white spots may be because of that stress. anyhow you kindly visit the dentist one more time. if those spots are same what i suspected, then the treatment is required apart from stress relieving methods. i think my answer would satisfy your query."

"husband had abnormal egg echo test clear but positive stress test showing he may have had a heart attack.he is 59 and father had angina died at 68 with stroke husband is non smoker and non drinker , has to have angiogram , could it be a false alarm or am i deluding myself ?",1,81762,"hello welcome to chat doctor. as per your description, your ecg suggests that you have already sustained a heart attack. but only ecg cannot be relied upon since your stress test is normal, and you have had no symptoms. stress test is normal, but it has only 70% sensitivity that means it will catch only 70% of cases with blocks. some people do have ecg's that suggest heart attack but end up having normal results. i recommended, and you undergo a 2d echo which will show if there has been any damage caused to the heart by the attack. the damage if present should correspond to the area in which ecg suggests a heart attack. if the echo shows abnormalities, then you must undergo a coronary angiogram. if 2d echo is normal then you need not worry about the ecg findings. also, important here is to do a 2d echo from a reputed center, because it is an observer dependent test and details may be missed if done at non-experienced hands. i hope i have answered your query satisfactorily. wishing you good health.regards."

a had proton radiation therapy about 2 years ago and my spa has been dropping to.09 . a now am experiencing blood in my urine and the passing of tissue . a had a test with a scope and my urologist noticed some inflammation or something on my bladder and a am scheduled for a biopsy tomorrow . i understand that it may be inflammation or bladder cancer . is this typical after radiation ? that is the cure if it is scarring and what is the cure rate if it is cancer .,1,9402,"hi, thanks for writing in to us. endomentrial adenocarcinoma is a cancer of the inner lining of the uterus. this is treated by surgery in the initial stages. some patients also require chemotherapy and radiation therapy for proper cure to take place. as you had surgery done and lymph nodes were negative therefore it is possible that the cancer was still localized to the uterus; however in some patients the biopsy of the specimen might show severe grade malignancy cells and this needs to be eradicated with chemotherapy and radiation. if you do not take chemotherapy and radiation then it is always possible that the disease spread might occur to other adjacent structures and then there will be metastasis even in the absence of primary tumor. cancer must be treated sufficiently so that it does not return. please do not worry."

"a have been having an intermittent pain in my upper left chest about five inches above my nipple and approximately an inch or two to the left of it . is this a sign of something ? it has been off and on for about the last three days , occurring every 20-30 seconds",2,96947,"hellowelcome to chat doctor. i have gone through your description. she has got hypertension for which she is on two medications. symptoms like pricking sensation in the chest are not typical of heart related origin. but in addition to the pricking sensation, if there is chest pain or chest discomfort, which is continuous (not on and off) for at least more than 20 mins, then it may point towards something which is of cardiac origin. in your description you have mentioned only once about pain lasting for more than 20 mins. so i don't think there is much to worry about. still if you want to be safe and clear, i advise you to do an ecg and undergo a stress test. this will help you predict whether she has some blocks in the heart. wishing you good health regards."

hi my brother daughter passes stool in pale yellow when we done tests it has shown high levels of bilirubin doctors suggested to go for a hide scan baby is 5 months old hide scan says that it is suggesting biliary artesian noe they have suggested a liver biopsy we have done it we are waiting for the result.metabolicreports are normal ply suggest me,1,1272,thank you for consulting chat doctor i'm sorry to hear about the condition of your brothers baby. biliary amnesia means the normal passage of bile from liver is impaired. the bile gives the normal color to the stool hence the stool is pale. the bile which cannot pass into the intestines get absorbed into blood and causes bilirubin level to rise. the liver biopsy study is done to rule out any pathological conditions affecting liver proper. the treatment of biliary amnesia is mainly surgical. surgical correction method is decided by the level of amnesia. please revert with further details like the complete hide scan report for commenting further on the mode of surgery required. thank you.

my brother aged 55 years is suffering from suspected abdomen koch but same has not been clear from usg ans scan and thereafter laparoscopy has been advised before starting treatment and no medicine has been advised so far so kindly advise us what should be next course of action in this ?,2,9495,"hello! thank you for the query. it looks like your son is suffering from partial bowel obstruction. and it seems he has been diagnosed but not treated. this condition is very probable due to abdominal adhesions. as this can be partial only, there are times when stools flow freely and times when it gets blocked. such blocked stool keeps accumulating and causes increased pressure what will sooner or later cause its passage. such condition is very hard to visualize with tests. in my opinion, when no other explanation has been found, you should contact a surgeon and ask him about laparoscopy. laparoscopy is a kind of surgery where the camera and tools are inserted into abdominal cavity through small holes. laparoscopy will tell if there are any adhesions (probably there is a lot of them) and if so, surgeons will be able to remove these adhesions. hope this will help. regards."

''",2,95651,"hello, with regard to your question, the answer is that there is nothing wrong with you. if you last 1-2 minutes during penetrating sex then this is ok. there is no receipt on how long a male penetrating act has to last and this is hugely variable from a few seconds to many minutes. it is true that today the pressure to ""perform as long as possible"" during penetrating sex is an obsession for men, but this does not mean that this should be the norm. the norm is what nature has designated for each of us. we are often misled by sexual materials we are bombarded with on tv and internet but most time those videos are distorting the reality and many performers take pills or various substances in order to make penetrating sex last longer. therefore, no man has to feel guilty if he can not last ""as long as it should"" during penetrating sex. i think that the more you engage with your partner, the longer your penetrating sex will last meaning that very likely you will last longer than 1-2 minutes. also, you have to manage stress more efficiently, if it is possible. if you are not circumcised than this could be another factor shortening your penetrating sex period because it is believed that uncircumcised men have a more sensitive penis head. i think that you do not need to do anything, nor seeing a doctor or turning to certain substances in order to increase your penetrating sex time. if you have solid erections, if you have no problems in having erections, if you manage to perform penetrating sex with your partner, then everything is fine and normal. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further. take care chat doctor."

by girlfriend is running a 111 heart rate . the is a diabetic and has a doctor appointment for the 17th and an appointment with cardio on the 19th . should we be concerned about her waiting for the appointments with her heart rate running so high ? also has had a few chest pains on occasion but they go away .,1,105243,"hellothanks for posting at chat doctor. your wife has symptoms of chest pain and discomfort on exertion which are very typical for angina sectors or ischemic heart disease. this means there are some blocks in the heart arteries. when a patient with such blocks walks or exercises, the heart rate increases and its blood and oxygen demand increases. since the arteries are blocked, they cannot cope up with the extra demand of blood and oxygen while exercising or walking. this causes the chest pain/discomfort. this same principle is used in a tmt. you are made to exercise on a treadmill while your ecg is continuously being recorded to see whether the ecg shows changes while walking corresponding to her chest pain. hence, it is called provocable ischemia since we provoke the event. before a tmt, a target heart rate is set for the patient till which the patient is usually made to walk on the treadmill. this target heart rate is usually 220 - age of the patient. your wives tmt showed changes of ischemia or deficiency in blood supply at 74% of this target heart rate. hence, this is a positive test and indicates a strong possibility of blockages in the heart in view of typical symptoms and a positive tmt. your cardiologist will advise a coronary angiography for her which is an invasive test done through a small hole in the hand or the leg. this will show the blockages in the heart and their severity. on basis of the angiography findings, further treatment (medical management vs angioplasty vs bypass) can be discussed. my feeling is she would require an angioplasty. please go ahead with an angiography and revert with the findings. wishing her good healthregards"

i have herniated discs in my neck as a result in used to my arms and hands going numb no feeling and dropping things at times . but the other day which this has happened a few times my left fore arm locked up while washing my hair it hurt and also was numb my concern is could this be a sign of a heart attack or stroke ?,1,1322,"hi dear, when a herniated disc occurs, it can release pressure on nearby spinal nerves and the spinal cord, causing unpleasant painful symptoms, very common ones are neck pain, radiating arm pain, shoulder pain, and numbness or tingling in the arm or hand. pain by patients are general explained as dull, aching, and difficult to localize to sharp, burning, and easy to pinpoint. pain in your arms as well as in your neck is usually the first sign that your nerve roots are irritated by a problem in your neck. symptoms such as numbness, tingling, and especially weakness in the muscles of your arms, are warning signs that your problem may be more serious. weakness in your arms is a definite sign that you should see a doctor about your neck pain. so i don't think it's a heart attack sign neither a stroke. not all patients with herniated disc require surgery. patient can find symptomatic relief through non-surgical therapies such as exercise, medication, physiotherapy. i will really advise you to meet your consulting doctor for further management and proper treatment.i may also feel from your questing that this problem has limited your life/daily work to some degree, i can give you my honest opinion that in my clinical practice i have seen attest 95 % patient getting relief from physiotherapy and conservative management.i hope you will carry on with the treatment .take care."
i have herniated discs in my neck as a result in used to my arms and hands going numb no feeling and dropping things at times . but the other day which this has happened a few times my left fore arm locked up while washing my hair it hurt and also was numb my concern is could this be a sign of a heart attack or stroke ?,2,71843,hi. can understand your concern. as per your complaint a lump and bruising occurs after injury or trauma as a result of inflammation and formation of hematoma due to broken blood vessels. a hematoma and inflammation can take a longer time to subside and can take months even but in case if you still have pain in the region along with numb feeling it can be due to secondary infection in the area leading to tenderness and swelling. the numb feeling can occur due to either pus formation in the area due to infection or it can be due to injury to nerve fibers which could have happened due to fall. i would suggest you to consult a doctor and explain the entire medical history and get ruled out for the cause of tender swelling a numbness. in case of infection antibiotics can help in reducing swelling and pain. in case of numb feeling due to nerve injury recovery can take a longer time of months and years even. in case it is due to pus formation it will get relieved once infection subsides. hope your query is solved. thanks and regards. chat doctor. .

this is general question . what is laparoscopy ? why it is done ? any risks ?,1,9711,"dear madam/ sir, welcome to chat doctor. surgeries are usually done either under local anesthesia, regional anesthesia or general anesthesia. i suspect you mom has been advised the last option (which is what you refer to as induced coma) which is the norm. nowadays kidney removal is done through key-hole surgery (laparoscopy). this is minimally invasive and recovery is quick but patient still needs to undergo the procedure under general anesthesia. i am sure the anesthetic will do what is necessary before putting your mom to sleep. best wishes"
this is general question . what is laparoscopy ? why it is done ? any risks ?,2,93629,"thanks for your question on chat doctor. thoracic surgery is of course a major surgery. it is done under general anesthesia and very much expertise is needed. in your surgery, sternum and ribs will be separated, and operative field will be achieved. so you may require blood transfusion too, during surgery. so don't think this as small surgery, it is a major surgery with a lot of risks. better to consult your operating surgeon again and discuss all these in depth."
this is general question . what is laparoscopy ? why it is done ? any risks ?,3,64792,"hi, i can only give general outlines of information without being there. fortunately, that's pretty good in this case since it is like any other pain situation. first, defining what the problem is. on the one hand, it's done, you know what part is causing the pain, but why it is causing the pain is an issue. mostly, this occurs with minimal joint problems, and it is from the hip cartilage wearing through and the same way the brakes in the car make the most noise when one spot has worn through, so, the hip pain is the most when there is the first spot wearing through. the pain decreases paradoxically when the hip become shot; and becomes a good case for hip replacement. so, mri to see what's gone wrong. if something is stuck on one edge, removing it works. otherwise surgery doesn't work well. anti-inflammatories, physical therapy to learn ways to avoid hitting the sore place are some options. hope i have answered your question. let me know if i can assist you further."
hello . a have a family member that recently had a pelvic exoneration which removed the cancer but recently came back . it is now in the place where her bladder would have been . the has lost a tremendous amount of weight & is too weak for chemo . that other options does she have ?,1,1356,"hi, thanks for writing in. cancer is a challenging condition but must be treated till the end. if your family member had a cancer near bladder mouth then she must have had locally infiltrate disease requiring exoneration. this is a surgical procedure by which most of the tumor and its adjacent structures are removed. even after surgery, seeding of cancer cells might take place and has happened in her case. if there is recurrent growth of cancer then she must take combination treatment with chemotherapy and radiation. as you have mentioned that she is too weak for chemotherapy therefore focused radiation remains the most tolerable treatment at the moment, but this depends on the general condition and local recurrence of the disease. please have a discussion with the cancer surgeon and radiation oncologist and proceed with treatment as per the outcome of discussion. please do not worry."

i . a have pain and pressure in the lower part on the back of my head and when a put pressure on it when a lay down on it a get dizzy . and now a noticed even if a a standing up and a look up a get dizzy can you give me an idea of what that is ? thank you,3,66334,"hello, i can understand your concern. have you ever been to a dentist after the pain started? pain that isl involving only one side of face and throbbing in nature when you lay down indicates possible presence of the decayed tooth. when we lay down, the blood supply towards the head and face increases. this also causes increased blood supply in the teeth. if a tooth is infected or decayed, this increased blood supply can cause severe throbbing pain. the pain gets little relieved after one wakes up and sits. in addition, if the upper tooth is infected or decayed, it can cause pain in cheek bone, upper jaw and lower jaw and area around nose. thus, you should visit a dentist for examination of the oral cavity and looking for any carious tooth that can cause such pain. if that indeed is a cause, then getting treatment of the infection, root canal treatment, will clear the infection and relieve you of pain. by the time you visit a dentist, ibuprofen 400 mg or motorola dt 10 mg up to thrice a day will help in relieving pain. i hope this answer helps you. thank you for choosing chat doctor. i wish you feel better soon. best,"
the last few days a have random quick but intense chest pain under my right breast . a am a 50 year old male in good shape . it lasts for just a few seconds and then goes away . more frequent when exercising but does not seem to hurt any more or less when breathing heavily . any clues ?,1,50935,"hi, there is a big range for normal heartbeat rates. for a 5-year-old, the heartbeat rate could be anywhere from 70 to 120. it will increase with exercise, crying, anxiety/stressful situations or feeling, straining (like to poop), and fever. also, the best way to check the heartbeat rate is to use a watch and tap out the heartbeat for a second person to count. besides, counting for a full 30 seconds and doubling gives a more reliable number than counting for just 10-15 seconds. i would check it a few more times over the course of a day prior to worrying about it. if she has pain, or seems to be having trouble breathing, then she may need to be evaluated for those problems. hope i have answered your question. let me know if i can assist you further."

an you get thrombocytopenia from a shingles vaccine ? by husband had a normal platelet level in november and then recently had a severely low platelet level . medications have all been the same . only difference is the shingles vaccine . yyyy @ yyyy,2,40098,"shingles is not transmitted from other people with shingles. it is caused by the chickenpox virus which goes dormant in the body for many years or decades. later in life it reappears as shingles. only a person who has had chickenpox at one time can get shingles. now people who have not had chickenpox can get chickenpox from someone with shingles. this would be unusual for a senior citizen; most people are immune to chickenpox by that age. it was just a coincidence that the person sitting next to the infected person also got it. shingles is just more common in older people. there is a vaccine for people over age 60 to prevent shingles from coming out on their bodies from the dormant virus, so you might consider getting this. hope this helps."
an you get thrombocytopenia from a shingles vaccine ? by husband had a normal platelet level in november and then recently had a severely low platelet level . medications have all been the same . only difference is the shingles vaccine . yyyy @ yyyy,3,87295,"hi, shingles are basically reactivation of chickenpox virus, anyone who had chickenpox may develop shingles. shingles are contagious but less so than the chickenpox, but it's important to note that the varicella virus (chickenpox virus) is contagious not the shingles. that means direct contact with shingles blisters, would cause chickenpox in someone who has never been infected with the virus or someone who never been vaccinated against chickenpox. in simple words shingle cause chickenpox in close contacts and shingles never cause shingles in close contacts. coming to your case, since you had chickenpox in childhood you are immune to virus, and you never develop chickenpox virus, and you can safely take care of your mother. since you have chickenpox in the childhood you may develop shingles in adulthood, and it can be prevented by vaccination. so it's better to take vaccine. rinsing your hands will definitely decrease the chance of contamination to others, so you should maintain good hand hygiene by frequently washing both hands.finally, one more thing, once the blisters scab, shingles are no longer contagious. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"a had a it scan of abdomen pelvis w/contrast as pain in stomach . report says a have fatty infiltration of the liver , pneumobilia is identified in the left lobe . extrahepatic bile ducts are dilated , likely reflecting the prior cholecystectomy . that does this all mean ? would this cause a lot of bloating ?",1,81304,"hi there, thanks for using chat doctor. one of the causes of elevated alkaline phosphatase is obstruction to the bile flow. this obstruction could be either inside the liver substance or in the bile duct. in these cases the liver panel would be abnormal. there would be a raise in the bilirubin level especially the direct component. an ultrasound scan may show dilated bile ducts. if the obstruction is inside the liver substance the ultrasound scan may not show it and a liver biopsy may have to be done to confirm it. this obstruction could be harmless as in gallstones in the bile duct or may indicate serious conditions like malignancy, primary biliary cirrhosis etc. there are other causes of high alkaline phosphatase also. bone disease can cause an increase in alkaline phosphatase level. pregnancy can cause a raise in alkaline phosphatase. is this answer helpful?"

( a am doing heavy construction work in my house . )",3,4763,"thank you for your query. creatine is found mainly in muscles. creatinine is a metabolic product of creatine. creatinine is removed from the body mainly by the kidneys. for this reason, it has been used as an indirect marker for assessing renal function. normally, an increase in creatinine above the normal range would indicate a reduction in the glomerular filtration rate (gfr) of the kidneys functional units. the gfr determines, how effective the kidney is removing metabolites and maintaining homeostasis. for, sedentary to moderately active individuals, the usual lab values provide a good reference.however, in athletes with more muscle mass compared to the non athletic people, there is more creatinine in the blood to start with and may not necessarily indicate a decline in renal function. diet rich in animal protein, protein or creating supplements, certain medications can all increase the level of creatinine in the body (either directly or by reducing its excretion at the kidney level). serial serum creatinine levels and monitoring of other renal parameters will help to determine if you have a reason to worry. try to eat a well-balanced meal and get all your nutrition from natural products rather than concentrated forms. hy chat doctor. if you are on any medications, consult your doctor to see if it contributes to the elevated levels. go for routine checks and monitor closely. if you have diabetes, hypertension or high cholesterol levels, risk of kidney damage is present. early detection will help prevent progression. hope this helps. wish you good health and get back to us if you need further clarification"

"a received a birth control shot about a month ago because a am sexually active and done want to become pregnant . the doctor had told me that there would hardly be any blood with periods and the cramps would almost be nonexistent . all of yesterday a had horrible cramps , the blood was a bit darker than usual , and there was what looked like a piece of skin with the blood . this has never happened to me before , and a was wondering what it could be .",1,77227,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, i want to clarify, if you are virgin and have not had sexual intercourse or ejaculation directly in the opening of your vagina, your chance of pregnancy is really nonexistent. sperm die when exposed to air, so there is no way that you can become pregnant from sperm that ejaculated outside the vagina. furthermore, is very uncommon to find women who ovulate during their menstrual cycle. therefore, you were most likely not at the fertile time of your cycle when you and your boyfriend had genital contact. furthermore, irregular bleeding can be caused by travel, changes in weight, hormonal imbalances and stress, especially the stress of worrying about getting pregnant. just because your period was light this month does not mean that there was anything wrong. now omens menstrual cycle is exactly the same every month, and as long as you got a period at the usual time, there is no reason to suspect pregnancy if the bleeding was different in quality than what you usually see. so i think that it is fine to be reassured that you did not conceive from this encounter with your boyfriend. if you continue to have irregular menstrual cycles for more than three months, you may want to visit your local physician as some hormonal imbalances can cause these problems and should be tested for. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was reassuring. best wishes,"

"a have had 4 screws , 2 pins , and a new veritable put in my lower back 6 years ago in july . a did some yoga classes , and the last one was on tuesday , and my back started to hurt on saturday . a started a new job and it entails some lifting . after 4 days of this , while lying on my back , on the floor , a put my hands under my lower back and hard and felt grinding . an a have loosen or broken the screw ? a a a 67 year old female in very good health .",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

hi in 16 and my girlfriend is 14 and we had sex for the first time about a month ago few days after her period ended and we had sex 2 more times after that and we used condoms in all of the time and yesterday she told me that she didst got her period yet and that she is late 5 or 6 days can you give a answer for that please we are freaking out !,1,57319,"hallow dear, unprotected sex on the night before expected day of menses have almost no chance of resulting in pregnancy. the egg is released way back, 14 days prior to the expected day of menstruation and has life of only 24 hours. the sperms are active for 72 hours. hence, a period of about a week around the day of egg release is fertile period. delay in her menses is likely to be due to the stress of the pregnancy. if she had any intercourse during the fertile period, then only she has to be worried about the pregnancy. pregnancy test on urine about 8-10 days after missed period will confirm the diagnosis. the brownish discharge she is getting could be starting of her menses. if she does not get menses in few days, she may be given tab. devilry for 5 days and within 4-7 days she will get her menses. however, i feel, wait patiently without stress, and she will get her menses. i hope this helps you."

i a got my wisdom tooth extracted about 2 weeks ago the extraction has healed but a can feel tiny hard lump with my tongue on the side of the extraction on the inner side of my mouth . its white and when a touch it with my finger it feels hard like a tooth or bone . is this normal and if it is a piss of tooth will it come out on its own or will a need to get it surgical removed ?,1,53390,hi. can understand your concern. as per your complaint the swollen gum and the white material inside it is a result of some inflammation. there can be a few reasons depending upon whether it is the second molar or the wisdom tooth. in case it is a wisdom tooth which is erupting or is impacted then the gum above it can get infected and inflamed due to either food deposition between the gum and the wisdom tooth or it can be due to gum flap bitten by the opposite jaw tooth and the condition is known as peritonitis. the white material in it is pus. in case it is second molar the swollen gum with white material in it can be as a result of infection in the gums due to deposits on the teeth like plaque or calculus or due to foreign body impaction in the gums which carries infection along with it deeper into the gums causing pus formation. it can also be due to deeply infected tooth causing pus formation below the tips of the roots of the tooth causing swelling on the gums with pus inside. i would suggest you to consult a dentist and get evaluated for the exact cause of the swelling and get treated accordingly. in case if it is wisdom tooth either excision of gum flap or extraction if the tooth is impacted followed by antibiotics and painkillers can be done. in case of gum infection professional cleaning of teeth followed by antibiotics and gum paints can help. in case of tooth infection root canal treatment or extraction depending on the condition of the tooth can be done. hope your query is solved. if you find the answer helpful please write a positive review and click on find this answer helpful as a token of appreciation. thanks and regards. chat doctor.

hello so i am freaking out right now about some itching from my vagina all the way to my anus and above . in top of that a have small read bumps between my anus and vagina but closer to my anus . they are small but there are quite a few of them . and a have been constipated and had some bloating of the stomach with a little pain that accompanies it .,1,69544,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the most likely explanation for the bumps in your anal area that you have noticed recently, is the development of external hemorrhoids. hemorrhoids are veins in and around the anus that become dilated from the pressure of your uterus and the babies head pushing downwards, especially when you try to move your bowels. the white bumps that you see are most likely hemorrhoids that have not become swollen with blood. the blue one that you see, more likely is closer to the surface, where the blood can be visible through the wall of the vein. as long as your anus does not itch, or that you don't have any bleeding from the area, there is nothing danger about hemorrhoids. they will generally resolve after delivery. i would ask your obstetrician to take a look at them the next time you have an appointment. in the meantime, taking site baths, which is soaking your rear end in a warm top filled with about 6 inches of water for 20 to 30 minutes, can decrease the swelling. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy, and i hope you feel better,"

"a recently had my gallbladder removed about 5 weeks ago . a am 24 , 100.2 lbs , a have started noticing blood in my stool . first they were loose bloody stool then normal dark bowel movement with blood in the toilet and toilet paper . would this be due to the surgery ? should a wait it out or call my doctor immediately ?",1,33660,"hi there, the backed up stool and tendency to urinary tract infection does point to the idea that she could be constipated, despite being regular. regarding the frequency of bowel movements, do note that different people tend to have different bowel needs, up to 3 times a day is accepted as normal. so she could actually be going daily and still be relatively constipated. what we are aiming for is the right consistency of stools, which is long and sausage-like, with or without cracks. if you need more visual guidance, look for the bristol stool chart online, and aim for type 3 or 4. it is good that she is taking enough fibers, but also pay attention to her habits and stress to her that she needs to go when she feels like it even if it is more than once a day. constipation often occurs at this age because this is when they are getting better at holding it in, and prefer other exciting activities to sitting in the toilet. the other rarer possibility would be that she has a mild form of hirschsprungs disease, which means that some nerves are missing from the end of the colon, making the evacuating of stool difficult. most people have this diagnosed as babies, but if its very mild it can be missed. it might be more likely if she had delayed bowel movement more than a day after birth, or had tendency to constipation even as a baby. you will have to discuss with your doctor on this possibility, because confirmation would be needed with a rectal biopsy. hope this helps, and all the best to you."

"a have a broken tooth second to last molar ( wisdom teeth have not came in they are sideways and need to be extracted ) . a went to a dentist and they used tools that a assumed were sanitized but after they cleaned the area above my broken off tooth a developed a very hard access , this was 2 weeks ago and now it formed a head so a popped it to relieve it until a see them the 28th and jellied blood and pus came out , it feels better now but the swelling has made my cheek look puffy and noticeably swollen . should a take this to the emergency room or wait to see my dentist again ?",1,57293,"hi. welcome to chat doctor. as per your complaint it seems that you have inflammation of the gum flap surrounding the wisdom tooth and the condition is known as peritonitis. pericoronitis occurs if food gets lodged between wisdom tooth and the gum flap covering the wisdom tooth... and by food it does not mean that you see big food particles stuffed in there, but it also means uncleaned area and bacterial growth below gum flap... it leads to inflammation of the flap leading to pain swelling and as the area lies close to the throat there can be sore throat and swollen lymph nodes. but pain in the tooth in front of the wisdom tooth can be infection or decay in second molar tooth. the line of treatment is antibiotics, painkillers, mouthwash but only this is not enough to you, you should go to dentist again and ask him to irrigate the area between gum flap and wisdom tooth with saline, betadine solution and hy chat doctor. . other thing is done warm saline gargles, it will help you to reduce inflammation... carry on with the course of your antibiotics and painkillers, your pain and swelling must go in two three days. once you get relieved of your discomfort visit the dentist again and get an iop ar (x-ray) done to find out whether wisdom tooth will erupt to proper occlusion or is impacted (means having an obstruction and won't erupt to occlusion). if it is not impacted just get your gum flap removed known as operculectomy and if impacted get your tooth extracted... this will be your ultimate treatment and finish your problem forever. if the second molar tooth is also decayed leading to pain you can get root canal treatment done to save the tooth and resolve infection. hope you recover soon. thanks and regards."

"an a baby girl get ring worm in her vagina area ? 9 to old baby , cousin that lives with her was just diagnosed a ring worm , she also today started a yellow greenish discharge from her vagina and has a red ring area around her vagina , no clear ring , just redness in a circle right now",1,95340,"hi, i understand your concern and your problem. this may happen in the following scenarios. 1. the nova ring is broken; sometimes the joint of the ring is broken, so it may not regain back its desired shape once inside the vagina and slips out. in this case try a new ring.2. the vagina is lax and roomy. sometimes vaginal laxity may interfere with holding the ring in place, this is very rare and unless the vagina is too lax, it does not slip.3. ring not pushed far enough; sometimes women do not push it far enough inside so that it remains at the vaginal opening and slips out. the first and third are common likely causes. check to see if any of this is happening to you. if the ring is broken use a new one and use some other method like condom for next 7 days. if you are scared to push it in, i want to reassure you that don't be afraid. this ring is safe and will not go anywhere other than the vagina. it does not cause any trauma, so it is safe. just push it way inside, so it will not slip. the best position to do this is lying down and slowly pushing it inside towards your buttocks that is backwards. a tilted uterus will not affect the position of the ring and neither will it have any effect on its insertion. another word of caution is that if the ring has been lying outside for more than 3 hours, use another method like condom for the next seven days after correctly inserting the ring. hope i was able to help you, thank you for using chat doctor and have a nice day."

hello or a have a friend who is about 26 years old and is affected by polio in the right leg.his entire right leg is thinner and a believe a little shorter than the left one .. while walking he has to force the right leg forward to walk .. kindly suggest its treatment . ?,1,18289,"hello have gone through your question and understood your concern. pain in the legs can occur as a result of conditions that affect bones, joints, muscles, tendons, ligaments, blood vessels, nerves, or skin. leg pain can occur at night, while lying down, or while running or exercising, depending upon the cause(an in jury or a chronic disease.) since the leg contains a number of different structures and tissue types, a wide variety of conditions and injuries can cause leg pain. in your fathers case, in my opinion the cause can be diabetic neuropathy (nerve damage from diabetes). this is a common cause of leg pain in diabetics. anyway my recommendation for you is to consult his doctor because for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, it is important to differentiate the exact type and location of his pain in the leg. apart diabetes other potential causes of leg pain are:peripheral artery disease, blood clots (deep vein thrombosis), arthritis conditions, the pain of sciatica (from disc disease of the spine). all these alternatives should be taken in consideration for the right diagnosis and only after the right diagnosis your father can have the right treatment. hope this is helpful. thanks for using chat doctor for your health queries. wish you all the best."

"hello , a be been on tri-sprintec for 3 full weeks today . a started taking the pill on the first day of my period . it day 14 a had unprotected sex and the following day a took a different brand of birth control pill as an emergency contraceptive . pm a at a great first for being pregnant since a a new to the pills ? a be read elsewhere online that it takes at least a month to be completely safe . thanks",2,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"i suffer from abdominal pain , heaviness and tiredness in the body.when a sleep less my lower abdomen swells and face swells too.i also urinate excessively approx 18 times in a day when i sleep less .and on an average 12 times.i got my thyroid checked .it shows normal . a have polycyclic ovary and hence irregular periods.my face looks tired all the time.i am under great mental stress too due to personal reasons.please help",1,87653,"hallow dear, you are 31 weeks pregnant. at this stage of pregnancy, the fetus does move freely in the uterus. when you feel it is moving rather too much, i would advise you to count the fetal movements. count the number of times fetus moves in continuous 12 hours. a healthy fetus moves about 10 times during 12 hours period; or you can say on an average it moves once every hour. of course, the fetus also has its own body clock. it does sleep at its own time, which may not be congruent with mothers sleep. therefore, i advise having a foetal movement count for 12 hours. please make note of each movement on a paper to avoid mistakes in the count. if the count is less than 10 in 12 hours, you have to report to your obstetrician. i do empathize your concern due to previous placental abruption. however, placental abruption is a sudden event, though the cause may be over a period. so the fetus stops moving when placenta is separated. increased fetal movements may not be indicating placental abruption. still for your mental peace, better get ultrasonography done to ascertain the health and growth of the fetus and also integrity and maturity of placenta. if baby and placenta are healthy and normal, you need not worry about the fetal movements if they are within normal limits. another investigation you may undergo is electronic fetal monitoring which not only will count the fetal movements but will assess the fetal cardiac activity during movements and during braxton hicks uterine contractions. if there is any impending risk, it will be reflected in the fetal heart tracings. i hope this guidance is useful to you."

"i , i am 25 and a have always had a 28-30 day cycle . a got my periods on 28th april and had unprotected sex with my husband on 10th and 11th of may , assuming that my ovulation date should have been 6th may and ended maximum by 9th may . however , this month a have not been getting my usual menstrual cramps or weakness in body that a otherwise get from a week to 10 days before my period is due . also a have been facing high acidity from last 3 days , it was there for the whole day on friday . saturday and sunday it was there only in the morning , and then a feel totally fine later on . would it be that a am pregnant , when can a take a pregnancy test . but mostly a want to know , how could a have been fertile on 10th may . or is it something else and not cause of pregnancy ?",1,52747,"hello, and i hope i can clarify this for you. you are absolutely correct in the fact that the length of your cycle is related to when you ovulate... and your ovulation date is 14 days back from when you got your period, rather than counting 14 days from the start of your period. it is typical for most women to have a 14-day luteal phase, as you suggested. you absolutely may ovulate later in your cycle. i do not know how long you and your partner have tried to conceive before trying closed. i would not recommend trying closed at all unless you have tried for a year (meaning unprotected sex at least 2-3 times per week) and not become pregnant. a reproductive endocrinologist is an appropriate referral if you have a history of infertility for one year, and if you fail at least 3 cycles of closed. they can prescribe closed and combine it with intrauterine insemination, which can increase the success rate. even though you may have had a child together before, there can be an issue with the male partner too, and it would be advisable he gets his sperm count evaluated. but you can still have conceived this cycle if you ovulated on the closed, and continued to have unprotected sex at least a week after your ovulation kit showed positive. your progesterone level pre-ovulation is not relevant at all. so- if you don't get a period by day 35 or so, do a pregnancy test. and if you didn't conceive this cycle, a reproductive endocrinologist might be a better choice to manage your closed. i hope this answered your question, and best of luck in getting pregnant. take care,"

is there any medicine for neurotics syndrome in ayurveda to cure it completely ? can it reoccur again ? by child 2.5 years now was suffering from this syndrome last year . was cured that time . but there are chances for relapse & no medicine in allopathy which can rule out the same in allopathy . to a wanted to know that is there anything in ayurveda or homeopathy to rule out the same completely by mail id is yyyy @ yyyy,1,82366,"hello friend, thank you for posting your query through chat doctor. i am a homeopath answering your query and the answer which i am going to give you may contain several thoughts which may appear strange or new for you. this i say because homeopathy is a new system of medicine and is almost unheard by the majority of the population. therefore, due to the high influence of the conventional medicine the people at large are brainwashed to believe and act according to the health education given by them. coming back to the fibroadenoma of your left breast in the year 1979, you had a psychological conflict in the mind level. you are a sensitive individual and that is why your left breast was affected. it must have been related with your child chat doctor. the sensitivity is genetic, and you reacted to the conflict through the brain according to a genetic programming. mind-brain - organ affection resulted in the development of a lump in your left breast in 1979. you consulted your gynecologist, and he suggested that it may turn to become cancerous in future and so it is better to remove it, and you subdued to his suggestion. actually the lump in the breast was an attempt of the body to cure you, or it was the result of a self defense mechanism. since you had not resolved the conflict in the psychological level, the lump remained there without getting resolved. but the body kept the lump protected in a cyst with minimum amount of inflammation called chronic cystitis. by removing the fibroadenoma or chronic cystic mastitis, you were not cured, but your lump in the breast was removed. in 1995 also you are the same person, you are the same sensitive person, and you underwent another more serious psychological conflict and the same left breast was again affected in a more serious manner. instead of recognizing the mass as a defense mechanism, you got the fear in you that you have cancer. the tissue changes also suggested that there is more serious pathology, and they labelled your lump this time as cancer and suggested removal of your left breast. if you could have recognized the lump as a defense mechanism and if you had no fear of cancer, you could have retained your breast. but the fear of cancer is such that it is associated with death and so you lost your breast. in no case, either by removal of lump in 1979 or by removal of your breast in 1995, you are not cured only your disease is cured. hope by this time you have got the answer for your query. both are related to each other because they are in the same individual, same sensitivity, same program. homeopathy cures the person and once the individual is cured all his diseases will be cured. with best wishes,"

"hi doctor . we are planning for pregnancy last month april 2011 we tried but this month i got my period but it was late , even i had pregnancy symptoms .. and i had some urine infection . last month we travelled about 600kms was it affected for my pregnancy plus answer me",1,100663,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. contrary to popular belief, many women can miss a menstrual cycle once in a while for reasons other than pregnancy. stress, weight changes, differences in your daily schedule, and even worrying about pregnancy can delay your cycle and sometimes even make you skip your period. what i can say for sure, which i hope you find reassuring, is that there is no way that you could be pregnant from an encounter that happened before you had to normal menstrual cycles. however, if you had had sex since your last period, i would recommend performing a pregnancy test as the most common sign of pregnancy is a missed menstrual cycle. what i suggest you do at this time is, if there is no possibility of pregnancy, just try to wait and see what happens when your period would be due this month. if you miss another menstrual cycle, it would be prudent to see a doctor for evaluation, as other hormonal problems and medical issues can also be a reason why your menstrual cycle skipped. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was reassuring. best wishes,"

hi doctor my son 5 yrs and 3 months old complained that he can not read faraway letters so we went for an ophthalmologist and he confirmed myopia . his prescription is -1.5 in left eye and -4.5 and cylindrical power -2 in right eye . he prescribed glasses and patch for symptom of lazy eye . i wanted to know how worst is this and how to follow up,1,1925,"hello, you are on the ball. your child complained, and you took him to the eye doctor immediately! many young child chat doctor. in fact, it is the most common vision defect in this age group. normally both eyes line up together. in a lazy eye, one of the eyes deviates, so the eyes do not line up together. the patch makes a correction so that with time both eyes will line up normally. if you had not taken your child to the ophthalmologist and his lazy eye wasn't correct, your son would have vision loss. i should think the eye specialist would want to see your son back in 2 months for his first eye check since he got his glasses. you may wish to invest in a pair of eyeglasses whose frames bend and not break and whose lenses are scratch resistant. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further. take care"

(of course, once he is sleepy or has gone to sleep, you can remove them for the entire night). there is no truth in the belief that if you keep the glasses on, the number will reduce. in fact, if his eye is developing a problem that will cause his number to increase, even his wearing the glasses continuously cannot prevent this from happening. there is nothing that you can do to ensure that these changes do not happen. your ophthalmologist is the best person to take counsel from. he should check the children lens and the entire eye to determine how the future will go. i would advise you to continue following his advice and to never neglect your sons eyes, as neglected error of refraction will affect his learning at school, his brain development and all aspects of his life. best wishes."

a am having a problem and not sure if a should go to the doctor . a have been having abdomen pain usually on my left hand side it is always sudden . the pain goes away after a go to the bathroom and poop . but a usually only go once every week or two . also most of the time when a do go a have diahrea .,1,77921,"most people who have gallstones do not have symptoms. if you have symptoms, you most likely will have mild pain in the pit of your stomach or in the upper right part of your belly. pain may spread to your right upper back or shoulder blade area. sometimes the pain is more severe. it may be steady, or it may come and go. or it may get worse when you eat. you may decide to go to the doctor because of pain in your belly. in this case, your doctor will ask you questions about when the pain started, where it is, and if it comes and goes or is always there. your doctor may order imaging tests. these take pictures of the inside of your body. an ultrasound of the belly is the best test to find gallstones. this test does not hurt. your ultrasound may not show gallstones. but if your doctor still thinks you have a problem with your gallbladder, he or she may order a gallbladder scan. in this test, a doctor injects dye into a vein in your arm. then a machine takes x-rays as the dye moves through your liver, bile duct, gallbladder, and intestine. if you do not have symptoms, you probably do not need treatment. if your first gallstone attack causes mild pain, your doctor may tell you to take pain medicine and wait to see if the pain goes away. you may never have another attack. waiting to see what happens usually will not cause problems. if you have a bad attack, or if you have a second attack, you may want to have your gallbladder removed. a second attack means you are more likely to have future attacks. many people have their gallbladders removed, and the surgery usually goes well. doctors most often use laparoscopic surgery. for this, your surgeon will make small cuts in your belly and remove your gallbladder. you will probably be able to go back to work or your normal routine in a week or two, but it may take longer for some people. sometimes the surgeon will have to make a larger cut to remove the gallbladder. it will take longer for you to recover from this type of surgery. regards and take care"
