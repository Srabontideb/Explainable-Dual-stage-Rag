(many couples seek help at six to nine months, though, which is fine if you're getting anxious about your failure to conceive.) having sex every day does not decrease your chances of getting pregnant. i hope that helps, and good luck!"

i was on repro birth control shot for at least 7-9 years not consistently though . a had two early abortions and i did to need any a & a . i been of the shot for a year now and have been trying to conceive . do you think i will ever conceive a child ? or should i wait a bit longer i am 33yrs old,1,76346,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. fertomid is a type of fertility medication used help to cause ovulation in women who have trouble getting pregnant. because you did get pregnant (even though you had a miscarriage), unless you have been trying since then for over a year and been unable to conceive, the fatimid medication will not likely increase your chance of pregnancy significantly. therefore, even if you forgot to take some pills, you still have a significant chance of pregnancy as you are still very young, especially if you have regular menstrual cycles. if you and your husband have not been trying to conceive for more than a year on your own, i would not recommend using any fertility medication. using fatimid for more than four menstrual cycles can actually reduce your risk of pregnancy, as it decreases the effect of estrogen on your uterine lining. 80% of healthy couples will conceive within one year if they are having regular (at least 2 to 3 days per week) intercourse without contraception. one in 10 pregnancies will end in miscarriage, which means that 90% of the time couples will conceive a perfectly healthy pregnancy after a miscarriage without any form of medical treatment. so in summary, missing the fatimid tablets this particular month will not likely affect your chance of conceiving this cycle if you already ovulate naturally. i strongly recommend trying to get pregnant naturally for one year before using any type of fertility medication, as your body has proven that you can conceive even though that pregnancy did not work out. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this additional information was helpful. best wishes,"

"a have mild chest pain , mild to moderate back pain in the middle of my shoulder blades . a also feel sick to my stomach and burp a lot after meals , the mornings are of but as the day goes on it gets worse . a do sometimes get heart palpitations and my doctor says its probably msg side effects . a have been really watching what a eat with no real help .",1,77921,"most people who have gallstones do not have symptoms. if you have symptoms, you most likely will have mild pain in the pit of your stomach or in the upper right part of your belly. pain may spread to your right upper back or shoulder blade area. sometimes the pain is more severe. it may be steady, or it may come and go. or it may get worse when you eat. you may decide to go to the doctor because of pain in your belly. in this case, your doctor will ask you questions about when the pain started, where it is, and if it comes and goes or is always there. your doctor may order imaging tests. these take pictures of the inside of your body. an ultrasound of the belly is the best test to find gallstones. this test does not hurt. your ultrasound may not show gallstones. but if your doctor still thinks you have a problem with your gallbladder, he or she may order a gallbladder scan. in this test, a doctor injects dye into a vein in your arm. then a machine takes x-rays as the dye moves through your liver, bile duct, gallbladder, and intestine. if you do not have symptoms, you probably do not need treatment. if your first gallstone attack causes mild pain, your doctor may tell you to take pain medicine and wait to see if the pain goes away. you may never have another attack. waiting to see what happens usually will not cause problems. if you have a bad attack, or if you have a second attack, you may want to have your gallbladder removed. a second attack means you are more likely to have future attacks. many people have their gallbladders removed, and the surgery usually goes well. doctors most often use laparoscopic surgery. for this, your surgeon will make small cuts in your belly and remove your gallbladder. you will probably be able to go back to work or your normal routine in a week or two, but it may take longer for some people. sometimes the surgeon will have to make a larger cut to remove the gallbladder. it will take longer for you to recover from this type of surgery. regards and take care"

a have had my canine crowns redone twice now . after the first placement a noticed that a had lot of sensitivity around the outline they were redone and a week later the sensitivity is still there in the exact same spot . new impressions were taken and new crowns were made so why is this happening and is the lab just not making them right or is it my dentist a error ? that needs to be done now ?,1,86378,"hi. welcome to chat doctor . i have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. as per your complaint it seems that pain in gums and teeth after deep cleaning and placement of crowns even after 4 days is not a normal finding. if the treatment was appropriately done, then the pain and discomfort should have subsided by now. there is a possibility that either the area is infected still or there are nerve exposures in the crowned teeth if they are not pre-treated with root canal treatment before the crowns were placed. you need getting re-checked by consulting your dentist and getting evaluated and a thorough clinical evaluation and investigations like x-ray of the painful areas can help in diagnosis and treatment can be done accordingly. in case if there is infection, a course of antibiotics and painkillers will relieve. in case if there is nerve exposures, then the crown will have to be removed and the teeth needs to be root canal treated and once the pain completely subsides replacing the crown needs to be done. as of now you can take anti-inflammatory painkiller like ibuprofen and also take a soft diet. if pain is severe you can take tramadol or motorola. take soft diet. hope this information helps. thanks and regards. chat doctor."

i am having pain in my left testicle and groin . a have been to emergency twice . a have had two ultra sounds done . one ultrasound found an inguinal hernia and another found a varicocele . also found inflammation in the epididitmis . hence the antibiotic i think . i had a surgery done where they went in through my belly button with a camera and the urologist said that they felt neither was in need for surgery . a have been on antibiotics for 11 days already but the pain is still there . the pain is somewhat tolerable if i layton and do nothing but never goes away .,1,94669,"welcome to chat doctor ! gall bladder surgeries are one of the most commonly performed surgeries these days, even on youngsters. it is usually done after ultrasound and blood tests which can tell in advance in most of the cases if there is an active infection going on. however, in my experience i have seen cases in which it is only during surgery case becomes clear enough. the condition which you have mentioned is one of acutely inflamed gall bladder, which is first tried with laparoscopy but because found difficult to access was later tried with open surgery. when the gall bladder is found acutely inflamed during surgery and especially if it is stuck to either liver or any other organ, it is usually not operated on. so, i think that your doctor has done the right thing. such cases are preferably given time for few weeks to months for acute infection to settle down, under antibiotics and vigilance. they are later operated on after repeat investigations. please maintain dietary restrictions and take the prescribed medicines, and it will help you. because your gall bladder is already stuck between liver and stomach, it is possibly have shrunk and has less possibility of getting ruptured. regular supervision in between will keep you informed about the status of your gall bladder. keep in touch with your doctor. i can understand that it is difficult to undergo repeat surgery or wait for it, but in my experience i have seen such cases, and they had successful outcome. i hope this will help you, and feel free to ask further if you have any other question in mind regarding this."

a have been prescribed promethium by my lyme dr. as a have chronic lyme disease . while a was pregnant a did not have any of my usual joint pain . by question is should a begin to take this at the beginning or end of my menstrual cycle ? a have a very regular cycle and want to continue that way . to a have to be concerned about weight gain as a side effect ?,1,76773,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. pregnancy symptoms vary widely between women, and many of the symptoms of pregnancy are similar to the symptoms of pms. anyone who has unprotected sex is at risk for pregnancy. however, if you do not have sex during your current menstrual cycle, there is no way you could be pregnant. the most common sign of pregnancy is a missed menstrual cycle. if you did not miss a cycle, and had a negative pregnancy test, and you did not have unprotected sex this cycle, there is no way you could be pregnant. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was reassuring. best wishes,"

"good evening sir , i am neva catania and few days ago my heart beat was very fast and i was feeling fear . doctor gave me medicine and after that my heart beat was normal . but sir , i get nervous very fast and then due this nervousness my hands starts trembling . and i get nervous on every small things . sir i want to get rid of this problem . because of this problem i am unable to face other people and i also started meditation for this . and now days i also feel some tightness and heaviness in my chest not regularly but sometimes .",1,9378,"hello and thank you for using chat doctor. i carefully read your question and i understand your concern. i will try to explain you something and give you my opinion. furthermore, i think that in your mothers' case we have to do with a rhythm issue. there are some pathologies of the electrical system of the heart that causes in the same time fast heart beats and heart electrical pauses. this pauses means that the heart electrical impulse fails for some seconds to generate a normal impulse or contraction. this leads to a pause making the person to lose senses or what we call syncope. sometimes it is difficult to diagnose this pathologies. the patient might experience fast heart beats, treating them with medication that might aggravate the situation and lead to syncope. so, in my opinion this is not a blood pressure issue but a rhythm one. of course long heart pauses lead to secondary hypotension. so if i was your treating doctor, and we are dealing with a history of losing senses and fast heart beat i will recommend some examination like an electrocardiogram, a cardiac echo to evaluate heart function and valves and a holder rhythm monitoring. through this process we can better judge what happens to your rhythm and how to ménage it. hope i was helpful. wish your mother good health. best regards."

"hello , good evening .. i am just going to ask about the high platelet count .. recently i got complete blood count and i found out that i have 512,000 of platelets and a doctor told that the normal range is 150,000-400,000 .. is there anything that i can take to reduce my high platelet count or any foods to avoid .. and what vitamins i can that will not cause anything to make my platelet count high again ? thank you very much",1,6849,"hi, this condition of decreased platelets is called thrombocytopenia in medical terms. decreased platelet count may have several causes such as chat doctor. from the description that you have given your condition appears to be adult itp (immune thrombocytopenia). it occurs due to molecules called autoantibodies on the platelets surface which destroys the platelets. autoantibodies in simple terms is like an army that attacks the people of its own country. i would suggest that you get a peripheral smear evaluated along with your complete blood count by a hematopathologist. you may also get a combs test done to find out if there are other immunological problems that are getting your platelet count down. i presume that your initial work up would have also included hiv testing as hiv can also cause low platelet count. however, in your case this does not appear to be the cause. the most important advice i would give is to monitor your platelet count regularly. repeating the bone marrow test is not necessary for itp as the problem is not in the marrow. if the platelet count falls below 50, 000/ cu. mm then your doctor should be notified. platelet counts below 20,000 have a risk for causing bleeding within the brain. adults with platelet counts >50,000/mm3 do not require treatment. treatment is indicated for adults with counts < 50,000/mm3 with significant mucous membrane bleeding. treatment also is indicated for those adults with risk factors for bleeding (e.g., hypertension, peptic ulcer disease, vigorous lifestyle) and in patients with a platelet count < 20,000-30,000/mm3. if your platelet count falls to a very critical range your hematologist may treat you with medication such as glucocorticoids, ivg immunoglobulin or newer"

"bleeding a am scheduled to get knee surgery this friday , but a am concerned because a have had rectal bleeding for several months after a use the bathroom and it comes out as if a were having my period when in not but my stool is normal . and a had sharp abdominal pain yesterday the bleeding is bright red and actual droplets , in 17 so what could it be ?",1,73563,"hi, thanks for writing to chat doctor. your condition is called rectal bleeding/hematochezia. this bleeding can happen if there is any bleeding in the intestinal tract. since you say the color is bright, it is possible there is internal bleeding towards the lower intestinal tract i.e. rectum or anus. but, you should also be concerned if there is possible cancerous cells. in regard to diet, i am glad you have noticed that sweets do not work well with you. it may be because your gastrointestinal tract is sensitive towards sugars and hence may be the resultant bleeding. since you know it well, avoid sweets and foods that irritate the digestive tract such as fatty foods, heavy pastas, etc. please consult a doctor as soon as possible. good luck!!!"

"hello ! last month i took monthly pill , when i consumed the whole pack , i stopped . few days after i got my period . 1st day after my period gone , i had an protective sex , until the 5th day . on the 7th day i took corvette 4tab , and after 12 hours another 4tab . a week later i had a withdrawal bleeding , not extreme but it went on for 3days . a brownish discharge . pm 4days late with my monthly period now . is there a possibility that in pregnant ?",1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

i actually i had a miscarriage 4 months ago again i am planning pregnancy i read on one website that even suppose if we want a baby boy we can conceive like they said that reduce your acidity and have sex on the day of ovulation is it possible scientifically they are charging nearly 70 to 100 dollars for this please advice me and actually i have a lot of acidity i am afraid like what they said it might destroy a sperms even daily i am drinking lemon water will this help me ? and please advice me like which days to have sex to increase the chance of pregnancy.thank you waiting for your reply,1,76346,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. fertomid is a type of fertility medication used help to cause ovulation in women who have trouble getting pregnant. because you did get pregnant (even though you had a miscarriage), unless you have been trying since then for over a year and been unable to conceive, the fatimid medication will not likely increase your chance of pregnancy significantly. therefore, even if you forgot to take some pills, you still have a significant chance of pregnancy as you are still very young, especially if you have regular menstrual cycles. if you and your husband have not been trying to conceive for more than a year on your own, i would not recommend using any fertility medication. using fatimid for more than four menstrual cycles can actually reduce your risk of pregnancy, as it decreases the effect of estrogen on your uterine lining. 80% of healthy couples will conceive within one year if they are having regular (at least 2 to 3 days per week) intercourse without contraception. one in 10 pregnancies will end in miscarriage, which means that 90% of the time couples will conceive a perfectly healthy pregnancy after a miscarriage without any form of medical treatment. so in summary, missing the fatimid tablets this particular month will not likely affect your chance of conceiving this cycle if you already ovulate naturally. i strongly recommend trying to get pregnant naturally for one year before using any type of fertility medication, as your body has proven that you can conceive even though that pregnancy did not work out. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this additional information was helpful. best wishes,"

"i yesterday my dad had an of annex injection and within say 10-15 minutes of the administration of this drug , he developed generalized discomfort with profuse sweating , palpitation , escalation in of , and abnormal ekg , repeated 3 times with findings of left ventricular hypertrophy , what could be the possible cause ? ?",1,3759,"hello and pleased to answer you left ventricular hypertrophy is defined as the increase in muscle mass of the left ventricle; it can be hypertrophied of the muscle leading to a systolic hvg or a dilation of the muscle leading to diastolic hvg. the diagnosis is suspected on the ecg and confirmed by ultrasound. among the causes of left ventricular hypertrophy are age, intensive practice of one or more sports, obesity, prolonged hypertension. the seriousness of hypertension arises from its impact on a number of organs (target organs). the complications that can develop at their level explain the increased morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension. the heart is one of the main target organs, and one of the first consequences of elevated blood pressure (pa) is left ventricular hypertrophy (hvg). the heart adapts to high blood pressure by increasing the volume, resulting in an increase in oxygen consumption by the heart muscle. as a result, coronary revascularization may gradually become insufficient. progressively, the diastolic function (see diastole) then systolic (see systole) will alter. in addition, this increase in volume of the left ventricle may cause ventricular rhythm disturbances (ventricular extrasystole for example) and poor revascularization of the deep layers of the myocardium (risk of infarcts). i advise you not to stop your antihypertensive treatment (keep it for life)to practice a hygiene of life with especially a diet without salt (look at the dash or dietary approach to stop hypertension see every day (45 minutes per 24 hours)and consult your cardio as quickly as possible. may this informations help you best wishes"

a just had a oyster after a diagnoses of endometrial adenocarcinoma . minor removed with good results and lymph nodes negative . a just learned a have atypical cells in pelvic fluid and dr. is recommending chemo and radiation . is this the most common treatment ?,1,9402,"hi, thanks for writing in to us. endomentrial adenocarcinoma is a cancer of the inner lining of the uterus. this is treated by surgery in the initial stages. some patients also require chemotherapy and radiation therapy for proper cure to take place. as you had surgery done and lymph nodes were negative therefore it is possible that the cancer was still localized to the uterus; however in some patients the biopsy of the specimen might show severe grade malignancy cells and this needs to be eradicated with chemotherapy and radiation. if you do not take chemotherapy and radiation then it is always possible that the disease spread might occur to other adjacent structures and then there will be metastasis even in the absence of primary tumor. cancer must be treated sufficiently so that it does not return. please do not worry."

"hi , i just got to know from my breast ultrasound reports that i have a well defined cystic area measuring approx . 4.4mm . is seen in the dermis layer of the sin of the left axillary region . both breast show predominantly fibre granular parenchyma . there is no evidence of any sol/ architectural distortion/ calcification . both nipple , reteroareolar region , skin , subcutaneous tissues and axillary tail region are normal . i am 23 years old female and i went to the gynaecologist yesterday in order to check if i had breast cancer . i was very scared because from last 4 months i had some pimple sort of thing on my left underarm . also i felt some burning pain on my left breast and on the underarm too . i also have spondolysis symptoms so i have the pain on the entire left side . please tell me is it related to any cancer . i am very scared .",1,82366,"hello friend, thank you for posting your query through chat doctor. i am a homeopath answering your query and the answer which i am going to give you may contain several thoughts which may appear strange or new for you. this i say because homeopathy is a new system of medicine and is almost unheard by the majority of the population. therefore, due to the high influence of the conventional medicine the people at large are brainwashed to believe and act according to the health education given by them. coming back to the fibroadenoma of your left breast in the year 1979, you had a psychological conflict in the mind level. you are a sensitive individual and that is why your left breast was affected. it must have been related with your child chat doctor. the sensitivity is genetic, and you reacted to the conflict through the brain according to a genetic programming. mind-brain - organ affection resulted in the development of a lump in your left breast in 1979. you consulted your gynecologist, and he suggested that it may turn to become cancerous in future and so it is better to remove it, and you subdued to his suggestion. actually the lump in the breast was an attempt of the body to cure you, or it was the result of a self defense mechanism. since you had not resolved the conflict in the psychological level, the lump remained there without getting resolved. but the body kept the lump protected in a cyst with minimum amount of inflammation called chronic cystitis. by removing the fibroadenoma or chronic cystic mastitis, you were not cured, but your lump in the breast was removed. in 1995 also you are the same person, you are the same sensitive person, and you underwent another more serious psychological conflict and the same left breast was again affected in a more serious manner. instead of recognizing the mass as a defense mechanism, you got the fear in you that you have cancer. the tissue changes also suggested that there is more serious pathology, and they labelled your lump this time as cancer and suggested removal of your left breast. if you could have recognized the lump as a defense mechanism and if you had no fear of cancer, you could have retained your breast. but the fear of cancer is such that it is associated with death and so you lost your breast. in no case, either by removal of lump in 1979 or by removal of your breast in 1995, you are not cured only your disease is cured. hope by this time you have got the answer for your query. both are related to each other because they are in the same individual, same sensitivity, same program. homeopathy cures the person and once the individual is cured all his diseases will be cured. with best wishes,"

"of doc , today is nov 13 , my period is 15 days late a took a few pregnancy test from the time my period was to be finish all was neg . in nov 18th a went to the doctors and did blood test and came back neg . now today is nov 23. what should a do ? by doctor said to wait 2 week just in case my period comes .",1,83091,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. having your period come late or skip occasionally is common in many women, even when they are not pregnant. most of the time, a delayed period can just be a chance event, but it also can because by stress, changing time zones or traveling, recent weight gain or weight loss. if that is the case, you will usually get it somewhere between 2 and 4 weeks late. a fall usually will not affect your menstrual cycle, unless the stress of your injury was a factor. either way, there is nothing dangerous about missing your period once in a while. if you miss your period for more than 3 months, you should see a gynecologist, so you can be evaluated for hormone imbalanced and the doctor can prescribe appropriate medication to help your period to come. if you are at risk for pregnancy (meaning if you had unprotected sex in the last three weeks), you should repeat the pregnancy test in a week or so just in case. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

hello . a had a microdisectomy 8.5 weeks ago . l4/5 and l1/s1 . very tight in buttock area and tightness in left hamstring . the terrible pain before the surgery is gone . by hips have been hurting very much when sleeping . a have to flip from side to side every hour in order to sleep . the pain is not only in the hip a am laying on but the other one also . any thoughts ?,1,44020,"i'm sorry to hear about your pain and how it is affecting you physical activity. now hip pain can be tricky. many times patients feel they have hip pain when actually the pain is from the sacroiliac joint. to differentiate, first imagine where you would point to if someone asked you where the most pain occurs. if the pain is in the groin and worsened with walking, climbing stairs, getting in and out of the car or a seat, it is likely hip joint pain. if the pain is actually out to the side and above your buttocks (picture someone placing their hands on their ""hips""), it is likely sacroiliac joint pain. many times patients with sacroiliac joint pain can have symptoms radiate down the leg, while hip pain typically radiates into the groin and sometimes to the same sided knee. the best way to figure the problem out is to have a x-ray of your hip and also of your low back and sacroiliac joint. i hope this answer is helpful. in either case, the good news is that stretching, anti-inflammatory medications and even a joint injection can be very helpful. i hope you feel better and get out golfing again soon!"

(as you said he has difficulty in walking now). you can also say to his parents that --- they can continue with all religious customs along with medicines, may be then they will agree... with medicine, he will start showing improvement in few days only... it is psychosis and patients will not agree to go to any doctor willingly, so you might need to take him forcefully. this is well accepted as it is for his benefit only. even if he doesn't agree for oral medicine there are injectables which are given to such patients... take the right step, take him to a doctor. hope the reply is useful feel free to ask more questions"

a just had my lower molar extracted on thursday and a have a golf ball size lump in my jaw line and is in horrible pain .. we back to dentist today and he said that a do not have a dry socket but a have had one before and it seems as a do have a dry socket . a am having to take painkillers every 2 hrs . is this normal ? he said it was a difficult extraction and that the gum tissue is very swollen .. a cant seem to get the pain under control . what can a do ?,1,109483,"hi. welcome to chat doctor . i have gone through your query and can understand your concern... as per your complaint and presentation of symptoms if you have got a tooth extracted then pain after 2 days is not an abnormal finding and if the pain is due to extraction then it will gradually resolve as the healing will proceed considerably. but in your case if the pain is progressively increased and the area to which the pain is radiating that is lower left jaw, left ear and side of neck it seems that there is some disorder related to the jaw joint known as temporomandibular joint and such a disorder is known as temporomandibular joint disorder. i would suggest you to wait for one week so that the healing of the extraction socket takes place so that the exact cause can be ruled out as if pain subsides after healing then it is due to the extraction socket. in case if still the pain continues then you will have to consult an oral physician and get evaluated and get a full mouth x-ray known as orthopantomogram [opg] done so that he can evaluate the condition of the jaw joints and make a confirmatory diagnosis. as of now you can take anti-inflammatory painkillers like ibuprofen and muscle relaxant like chlorzoxasone for relief. hope this information helps. thanks and regards. chat doctor. ."

"a am 30 weeks pregnant and having brandon hicks contractions about every hour , constipated with pressure on my tailbone , and my stomach is very sensitive to the touch when baby moves or i touch it all around the rib cage from left to right . that do i need to do",2,87653,"hallow dear, you are 31 weeks pregnant. at this stage of pregnancy, the fetus does move freely in the uterus. when you feel it is moving rather too much, i would advise you to count the fetal movements. count the number of times fetus moves in continuous 12 hours. a healthy fetus moves about 10 times during 12 hours period; or you can say on an average it moves once every hour. of course, the fetus also has its own body clock. it does sleep at its own time, which may not be congruent with mothers sleep. therefore, i advise having a foetal movement count for 12 hours. please make note of each movement on a paper to avoid mistakes in the count. if the count is less than 10 in 12 hours, you have to report to your obstetrician. i do empathize your concern due to previous placental abruption. however, placental abruption is a sudden event, though the cause may be over a period. so the fetus stops moving when placenta is separated. increased fetal movements may not be indicating placental abruption. still for your mental peace, better get ultrasonography done to ascertain the health and growth of the fetus and also integrity and maturity of placenta. if baby and placenta are healthy and normal, you need not worry about the fetal movements if they are within normal limits. another investigation you may undergo is electronic fetal monitoring which not only will count the fetal movements but will assess the fetal cardiac activity during movements and during braxton hicks uterine contractions. if there is any impending risk, it will be reflected in the fetal heart tracings. i hope this guidance is useful to you."

"i , a had a short period this month of about a day or two which is very abnormal for me being that it usually last about 5 days . about a week after that a began to spot a little which was pinkish and extremely light , now it is sort of brownish and its still light but heavy enough to have to guard it . that could be the issue ? a am on birth control ( iud ) , but for some reason a think a may be pregnant .",1,8772,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. the proper way to use the nearing is to put it in, leave it in for 3 weeks, take it out, wait one week, and replace it. during the week you are not wearing the ring, you should have some bleeding that is considered a menstrual cycle. if you wore the ring continuously for two months and then had a new one replaced but only removed it 3 days later, the pinkish spotting was your ""period"", which is caused by not wearing the ring. the bleeding was very light because you had suppressed it by continuously wearing the ring for over 2 months. so you should expect your next period about 4-5 weeks after the episode of spotting that you had. if you do not have menses by then, i recommend repeating the pregnancy test at that time. if you did not have regular monthly cycles before you used the ring, your cycle will follow your regular pattern that you typically have when not using hormonal contraception. if you are trying to get pregnant, you should have intercourse about every other day and begin taking prenatal vitamins as it benefits the health of the baby for the vitamins to be present at conception. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

hi i have just been 2 weeks of work with a very painful swollen left foot . after ray showing nothing an ultrasound was issued resulting in the finding of neutromata at the 2nd and 3rd web spaces . in addition a well defined hypo choice lesion was also found adjacent to the shaft of 3rd and 4th metatarsal . the ultrasound specialist recommended a fri would be useful to find out more but my doctor suggests cortisone injection .. i am normally on my feet 8 hours a day as dog trainer with repetitive excersices and training with numerous dogs . not getting a chance to have a break in between .. what would you recommend i do please,1,5596,"hello dear. to be on safer side i would advise you to get your son vaccinated again. but it depends on the severity of wound. if it is just minor abrasions then just 2 booster doses on 0 and 3rd day is enough. if the wound is severe or in sites like head, face, neck etc. then the entire course should be repeated. some doctors may suggest just a tetanus injection, and ask you to watch the dog for ten days. if there are any signs of madness in the dog in the course of ten days then report immediately and get vaccinated. otherwise, just a tetanus is enough. this may be the view of some doctors in case you are very sure that the pet dog doe snot have symptoms of rabies and its vaccinated. but still there is a minor chance of risk. why to take even the slightest risk? because once if a person contracts rabies then mortality is 100%.hence, you can contact a physician and let him assess the severity of wound and in case it is a minor wound just ask your son to take 2 booster doses on 0 and 3rd day. though the immunity lasts for 2 to 10 years but still it is advisable to take booster dose of rabies irrespective of the interval between the previous full course of vaccination, because we don't want to take risk with rabies. hope i have answered your question. feel free to contact me if you have any more questions. i'll be glad to help you. all the besting warm regards chat doctor."

"a have dark patches on my skin due to intense glycol peel and use of hydroquinone . the dermatologist thinks it is plasma or hyper pigmentation ! a think they are actual scar burns , because the texture in that area is rough and deep . not to mention my face has actual blisters in the area where it is dark and rough . a had this peel a year and a half ago , and my skin has not recovered . a tried hydroquinone again , but my skin has not gotten better . a have an olive completion now it is clearly gone . they told me to try the co2 laser , but a would have to continue the use of hydroquinone for 3 months . is there another alternative .",1,19160,"hi! welcome to chat doctor forum, if you are still getting acne it is important to get it treated first and then go for scars. if you have black spots on face due to acne then chemical peel is the best.it's a very short procedure which helps in exfoliating your skin gradually. it is done by a dermatologist where in a chemical (like glycolic acid or salicylic acid) is used over face and then washed off after 3-5 minutes. regular use of sunscreen is must. if you have pits or ice pick scars then you have two options depending upon the availability in your city. one is laser resurfacing where in lasers like co2, erbium laser or fractional laser is used. other is dermaroller where an instrument is used which has fine needles is rolled over the skin to cause minimal bleeding. this in turn causes collagen remodeling which help in filling up of the scars. this requires multiple sittings for good result. a combination of dermaroller and chemical peel can also be taken. so discuss these points with your dermatologist and take treatment accordingly. but remember, ice pick scars are very difficult to treat even though new lasers have come for the same. if you can tell me where you belong to, then probably i can suggest you a good place for lasers and peels. regards, chat doctor."

"my 7 year old daughter has had flue like symptoms for about 60 hours now , and has vomited once each day . the complains of dizziness when she gets up and is warm to touch . be have been giving her a little advil . today , she is complaining that her anus is burning and stinging , and she cant have a bowel movement because it is too painful . are these symptoms connected ? now can a alleviate the pain so she can have a bowel movement ?",1,33660,"hi there, the backed up stool and tendency to urinary tract infection does point to the idea that she could be constipated, despite being regular. regarding the frequency of bowel movements, do note that different people tend to have different bowel needs, up to 3 times a day is accepted as normal. so she could actually be going daily and still be relatively constipated. what we are aiming for is the right consistency of stools, which is long and sausage-like, with or without cracks. if you need more visual guidance, look for the bristol stool chart online, and aim for type 3 or 4. it is good that she is taking enough fibers, but also pay attention to her habits and stress to her that she needs to go when she feels like it even if it is more than once a day. constipation often occurs at this age because this is when they are getting better at holding it in, and prefer other exciting activities to sitting in the toilet. the other rarer possibility would be that she has a mild form of hirschsprungs disease, which means that some nerves are missing from the end of the colon, making the evacuating of stool difficult. most people have this diagnosed as babies, but if its very mild it can be missed. it might be more likely if she had delayed bowel movement more than a day after birth, or had tendency to constipation even as a baby. you will have to discuss with your doctor on this possibility, because confirmation would be needed with a rectal biopsy. hope this helps, and all the best to you."

"i am trying for my pregnancy my period cycle is 29 day and now i am 4th day of my menses 9th days my menses my husband alone planning to go abroad for job can i have any possibilities for conceive my husband says to eat durian plus help me thanks , mythilisundar",1,31972,"hallow dear, there is a lot of misconception. firstly, if you had menses from 10th to 15th, 18th is the day 8 of your cycle. the fertile window usually lies between day 10 to day 20 of the cycle (see below). so the chances of becoming pregnant are very remote. moreover, it is impossible for the nurse to diagnose a pregnancy on day 10 of the cycle after menses. the egg is yet to be released. the egg is released (ovulation) 14 days before the next expected menses. egg lives for 24 hours and sperms are active for 72 hours. hence, a period of about 8 to 10 days around this day of ovulation is considered as fertile window. so on 20th your ovulation also had not taken place. how can you become pregnant? no test for pregnancy will reveal pregnancy as it is not there. please wait for the menses. if you have few more intercourse in the fertile window, you will have chances to conceive and then 8-10 days after the missed period, your urine test for pregnancy will detect it. of course, beta chat doctor tests can give reliable results within 2-3 days of missed period. best wishes,"

please help ... a had unprotected sex in the early week of march .... but did it on the last day of my sensual flow .... a later start takin antibiotics that month because of an ailment ... when my period was due it did to come until after a week close to that same month end .... a saw my period 4 a normal days ... this is the next month since then and am due again but haven to seen my period ? a haven to been vomiting or feeling nausea ... except that a feel sleepy sumtyms ... but not tired ... what a wrong ?,1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

(please note that some episodes can last for 4-6 weeks until complete recovery). if you have shortness of breath in past years (even childhood), it would more favor diagnosis of asthma.3. i would like to mention here that most of the patients with asthma have normal chest x-rays. chest x-rays are not useful to diagnose or to rule out asthma. of course, chest x-rays are helpful to know if you have any other lung related conditions like pneumonia, etc.4. in general, i would also suggest you regular breathing exercises and avoidance of smokes/fumes/dusts to improve your lung capacity on long term basis. if you are routinely exposed to such environment, i would suggest you personal protection measures such as using face mask, etc. hope above suggestions will be helpful to you and will help you solve the confusions. should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at chat doctor. wish you the best of the health ahead. thank you & regards."

"i all and one , a just had a tooth extraction done monday just gone . as glad to find that a done have a dry socket but several things are worrying me : firstly it looks like 2 roots have been left in there , can this be right ? will it have complications later on ? is the tooth was suppose to be taken out due to pus being developed on the gum and was infecting everything around it , .. ? secondly , the tooth next to it its gum split ... one side is flopping around ? will it grow back together ? shall a be rebooting to go and see the dentist thank you in advance",1,53390,hi. can understand your concern. as per your complaint the swollen gum and the white material inside it is a result of some inflammation. there can be a few reasons depending upon whether it is the second molar or the wisdom tooth. in case it is a wisdom tooth which is erupting or is impacted then the gum above it can get infected and inflamed due to either food deposition between the gum and the wisdom tooth or it can be due to gum flap bitten by the opposite jaw tooth and the condition is known as peritonitis. the white material in it is pus. in case it is second molar the swollen gum with white material in it can be as a result of infection in the gums due to deposits on the teeth like plaque or calculus or due to foreign body impaction in the gums which carries infection along with it deeper into the gums causing pus formation. it can also be due to deeply infected tooth causing pus formation below the tips of the roots of the tooth causing swelling on the gums with pus inside. i would suggest you to consult a dentist and get evaluated for the exact cause of the swelling and get treated accordingly. in case if it is wisdom tooth either excision of gum flap or extraction if the tooth is impacted followed by antibiotics and painkillers can be done. in case of gum infection professional cleaning of teeth followed by antibiotics and gum paints can help. in case of tooth infection root canal treatment or extraction depending on the condition of the tooth can be done. hope your query is solved. if you find the answer helpful please write a positive review and click on find this answer helpful as a token of appreciation. thanks and regards. chat doctor.

hello am nikita just would like to know if everything would be okay and normal with my cycle .. because a didst know and took the posting 2 morning pill tablets at the same time . a didst know was 1 alone and the other in the next 12 hrs period ..... can you plus help thank you,1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

(considering your period of 30 days). so the ovulation day falls on 8 feb. thus the fertile period would be from 3 february till 11 feb. if your period is different from 30 days, please add or subtract those many days in this calculation. according to your calculation, the fertile period starts on 2 feb. so the chances of pregnancy due to intercourse on 31 jan. are remote, though cannot be completely excluded, since variation by couple of days has to be expected. it is too close to the fertile period. though there was no ejaculation, you cannot exclude pre-ejaculation fluid passage which happens unknowingly. it does contain some sperms which are capable of fertilizing an ovum. so though the maximum chances of conception are due to sex on 2 feb., for legal purpose, you may opt for dna test to ascertain the paternity. i hope this helps you."
"a have a small red patch on my upper gums above my 2 front teeth . 2 small white nodules appear in the center of the red patch.1 of the nodules just popped up about a month ago . the other one has been there for at least 6 months if not longer . it use to not hurt but recently its started developing a pressure feeling on one of my front teeth and pm starting to worry about it now . a haven gone to a dentist b/c of lack of insurance , but if this sounds serious to one of you a guess all try to go and make a payment plan with my dentist . by biggest fear is that it could be cancer . especially since skin cancer runs in my family .",1,83721,"hi. welcome to chat doctor . i have gone through your query and can understand your concern. as per your complaint a purple blotch over gums on teeth can be a bruise caused by some injury to the gums and toothbrush bristles can be one of the most common cause of injury to the gums, or it can be due to some hard food like chips that can cause injury to the gums and rupture of small blood vessels can cause blood accumulation below the soft tissues leading to formations of red to purple bruises. as it is not painful there and is localized to only front three teeth you need not worry as gradually it will resolve on its own. in case if it spreads or there is pain in the area you should consult a dentist to get ruled out for infection in the gums or teeth. as of now there is nothing to worry as nothing seems serious. hope this information helps. thanks and regards. chat doctor. ."

by renal ultrasound results say that both kidneys are mildly echogenic . by right kidney is 11.1cm and my left is 9.5 . one the left kidney there is a focal area of echogenicity which is relatively well defined which measures 20x30x15mm . by creatinine is a bit off and that is why a was sent to get an ultrasound . kidney disease is hereditary on my mothers side .,1,80735,hellothanks for query. kidney has two parts cortex and medulla cortex deals with the filtration of blood through kidney and production of urine along with excretion of waste products of protein metabolism (urea and creatinine)whereas medulla deals with blood flow to kidneys. in normal kidney during ultrasound scanning signal intensity of renal cortex is higher than that of medulla. this differentiation between signal intensity is reflected and well-defined in ultrasound very clearly. this differentiation is reduced in any renal parenchymal disease making it more echogenic than normal resulting into loss of differentiation between cortex and medulla. since your ultrasound report mentions cortex to be more echogenic and raised creatinine suggest that you have early renal parenchymal disease. chat doctor.

okay i live in the bahamas and been experiencing pain in my upper stomach .. it first started last year and i ruled it out as bad painful gas but as the pain keep coming back and the pain was the same i figured something was wrong the pain wakes me up if in asleep hurts my back makes me vomit .. i went to the emergency room last week in pain and they gave me a form to get a ultrasound done to see if its gallstones .. the test showed three calculi 14mm in my gall bladder and some peripheral follicles on my ovaries .. my ovaries done give me any problem my period is on time not heavy no clotting and i just had a child 3 years ago but yet i done have a lower pain ... what do you think,1,51327,"i have crohn's disease which is an ibd. ibd is different from ibs but similar, ibd can only be determined by a colonoscopy. i am only 19 years old i am also a female and i have experienced pain similar to this. i had the heaviness on my chest, and pain in my upper right side. turns out your gall bladder is located on the upper right side of your stomach and your pancreas is located in the center of your upper stomach which can feel like pain in your chest. both of which could all hurt your abdomen intensely if you have gallstones. gallstones can cause pancreatitis, which in a nutshell is swelling of your pancreas. it just so happens that i had gallstones and pancreatitis. it was relieved by removal of my gallbladder. just to be safe you might want to go to the local her and get an ultrasound of your gallbladder and have them check your lipase levels."

a took a pregnancy test on january 4th and it came back positive a then started to bleed like my normal . a went to the doctor and they took the chatdoctor blood levels the first one came back 79 and the second 74 a be also looking for different pregnancy test and they be all said a am pregnant what does this mean,1,35396,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. if you have not yet missed your period, even if you are pregnant, the line will appear very faint on the pregnancy test as your hormone levels are extremely low at this time in pregnancy. so there is no reason to assume that the test was wrong as the greatest likelihood is that you are actually pregnant. however, women can have a situation where they have a positive pregnancy test and then get their normal period on time. this is known as a chemical pregnancy and is caused by the situation where the egg is fertilized but never implants into the uterus and continues to grow. so i encourage patients in general to try to avoid performing pregnancy test before they actually miss their period, as even though you have a positive pregnancy test this early, it does not guarantee that the pregnancy is going to take. if your cycle is late, there is no reason to assume that there is any problem with the pregnancy. if you do retest after you miss your period and the line is still very weekly positive, it may be reasonable to see a physician and get a blood test for the level of your pregnancy hormone. pregnancy hormone levels are supposed to double every 48 hours so by the time you miss your period the levels should be significantly high enough to produce a clear double line on the pregnancy test especially if you perform it with your first morning urine as recommended. low hormone levels in early pregnancy can indicate that the pregnancy is not developing properly or that it can be an ectopic or tubal pregnancy, which needs to be diagnosed and accurately managed by a physician. in the meantime however, i encourage you to stop chat doctor. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes and good luck with the pregnancy,"
