(there's nothing much you can do to avoid, but just be vigilant to identify things early).2. get regular usg to make sure the left kidney is fine.3. it is possible for the right kidney function to reduce further as the child grows. this is because the left kidney will grow normally while your right won't. most of the time, the left kidney will enlarge and take up the extra-work. just monitor his bp and if it goes out of range, get him treated."

"i , pm 26 years old and i have pain between the gap of two teeth . the gap happened 4 years back when one of the tooth was removed for applying braces . a have removed the braces now and still the gap is not closed and creates pain often.please advice how to eliminate this pain",1,6132,"hi. thanks for the query. as you have gaps between all your teeth, and also you have overbite that is indication of an indication that you need braces to close the gap and also to correct your bite. so my suggestion is to consult an orthodontist and get a clinical examination done followed by appropriate x-rays and impressions of your teeth to make casts to plan your treatment. fixed orthodontic braces will help in appropriate alignment of teeth. as you also have inflammation of the gum flap over the wisdom tooth, so my advice to you is to first get the wisdom tooth removed and once the extraction site heals proceed with the orthodontic treatment. for now do warm saline gargles and antiseptic mouthwash gargles. take anti-inflammatory painkillers like ibuprofen to reduce pain in the gum. hope this helps. regards. chat doctor."

i a started taking cerezette last week as i was on microgynon for 2 years but have constant headaches with it . a only took the cerezette pill for 5 days as my legs started to really hurt and ache and had constant headaches and nausea after the 3rd day on it . a could to take anymore a felt horrible . a have under active thyroid also . this is the 3rd day of not taking it and a have come on a be made an appointment to see the nurse but that a only in 2 weeks a a just a bit worried to why have come on when a a not supposed to ?,1,6934,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. you are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. however, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next ""period"" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. so you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime. it sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. so if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. if you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general-either starting on the first day of your period or the sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on sunday you should start that day). ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. what will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. you may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any. if you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, i recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now. so in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. in the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

"hello . 4 out of my 5 lumbar discs are herniated , and there is a tutor sitting right on top of the first herniation . it is extremely painful . a was wondering how common is it to have 4 out of 5 of the lumbar discs herniated and how common are tutors on the spine please .",1,70951,"hi, thanks for writing in. to understand the origin of back pain and its connections, you have to know a little about the structures present. the lower back spine is known as lumbar and sacral spine and the coccyx or tail bone. the lumbar spine consists of 5 small bones aligned on top of each other and are separated by small discs which are made of soft material. the sacrum consists of 5 small segments. there are no discs between the sacral segments, and they are fused with each other. nerves come out from the spinal cord through small holes between the small bones. these holes are known as foramen. when the disc between two bones degenerated (l4 and l 5 in you), the 5th nerve is compressed at the foramen and there is nerve root compression. this nerve root compression gives rise to lower back pain and excretory problems. it is most often due to pressure effects and may return to normal when pressure is released. hope this helps"
"hello . 4 out of my 5 lumbar discs are herniated , and there is a tutor sitting right on top of the first herniation . it is extremely painful . a was wondering how common is it to have 4 out of 5 of the lumbar discs herniated and how common are tutors on the spine please .",2,160,"hi, thanks for writing in. the spine is made up of an alignment of small bones. these bones have sponge like discs between them and the spinal cord passes along the back of these bones through the spinal canal. there might be pressure on the discs in the dorsal and lumbar spine and this is causing slight pressure on the spinal canal at a particular level and causing pinching of nerve roots leading to severe pain in the area supplied by the nerve. the disc problem which had involved the t 12 - l 1 disc might have affected the discs at other levels also. besides, you also have fused vertebrae at lumbar levels. as your symptoms are on the right it is possible that the nerve roots on the right side are affected. you require to be examined a neurologist and an mri of the dorsal and lumbar spine if indicated to know if the nerve are under pressure and the location. there are patients who get relief by doing physiotherapy and taking neurogenic pain relievers. injections are also given for relief. however, this might not always happen. if your pain is severe and not responding to medical treatment then the disc protrusion needs to be removed by doing a small surgery at the cervical neck region. presently, laser assisted surgical techniques are also available. if the pain is mild then it appears to be a minor problem that is treatable. please do not worry."

"yes . my boyfriend takes workout drinks regular to workout . they have increased his blood pressure . he has a physical for a job , and being a bit anxious has raised it a bit more , is there a tip or trick to lowering it for a short time . to get to a more normal number ?",1,48088,"hello and thank you for using chat doctor. i carefully read your question and i understand your concern. i will try to give you some advises. in our daily practice in treating hypertension it is very important to look for secondary causes of hypertension. this is very important if we are dealing with a young person, because in this category secondary hypertension is very common. it means that it is a secondary disease or factor causing hypertension. it might be a renal problem, an endocrine or congenital problem. so first, my opinion as a cardiologist is that it is mandatory to do a full check up beginning with a blood analyses, an electrocardiogram, echo-cardiograph, thyroid hormones. after this, we might judge for others. the first thing to do when treating hypertension is lifestyle modification. if i was your treating doctor i will recommend stopping every workout chat doctor. in general, they have caffeine, maurine and stimulant factors that rise blood pressure values. your boyfriend should reduce alcohol and salt intake in daily eating. they booth rise blood pressure. he should stop smoking if he smokes and have a low fat diet to reduce blood lipids if they are high.these is just the simplest and the first thing to do. my opinion is that you will see a good result. if high values persist than he should make a deeper cardiologist consult. i hope i was helpful. best regards."

well i a 26 i had 5 miscarried my cycles are a regular i only hade a day period it was to light of one but last month was only a day light period to but anyways i was a month and 4 days late but my boyfriend found out that would relive me from my breast pain is sucking on them rite now they are pretty hard when they are not suck on could that be a sign of pregnancy,2,77227,"hello, and i hope i can help you today.first, i want to clarify, if you are virgin and have not had sexual intercourse or ejaculation directly in the opening of your vagina, your chance of pregnancy is really nonexistent. sperm die when exposed to air, so there is no way that you can become pregnant from sperm that ejaculated outside the vagina. furthermore, is very uncommon to find women who ovulate during their menstrual cycle. therefore, you were most likely not at the fertile time of your cycle when you and your boyfriend had genital contact. furthermore, irregular bleeding can be caused by travel, changes in weight, hormonal imbalances and stress, especially the stress of worrying about getting pregnant. just because your period was light this month does not mean that there was anything wrong. now omens menstrual cycle is exactly the same every month, and as long as you got a period at the usual time, there is no reason to suspect pregnancy if the bleeding was different in quality than what you usually see. so i think that it is fine to be reassured that you did not conceive from this encounter with your boyfriend. if you continue to have irregular menstrual cycles for more than three months, you may want to visit your local physician as some hormonal imbalances can cause these problems and should be tested for. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was reassuring. best wishes,"

hi.im 30 and keep getting twinges in my chest.not painful as such more annoying than anythn.also times get short of breathe a pounds feeling as if my heart beat hard and like i can hear it.even something as simple as getting up from a chair and walk to another pm it happens .,1,25338,"hello and thank you for using chat doctor. i carefully read your question and understand your concern. but you should not worry, its nothing serious. as you describe, my opinion is that it might be a rhythm issue. someone can feel strong and fast heart beats for different reasons. it may be a simple sinus tachycardia. this means that the heart is beating faster than 100 beats for minute. its normal range in a resting condition is between 60-100 beats for minute. when it goes up you may feel a strong heart beat in your chest and a sensation like your body is beating too. another reason for this sensation might be what we call an ekstrasystol.these is electrical heart impulses that generates in some parts of heart different from normal sinus rhythm. this generates an escaped beat that the person feels like jumping ore bumping. it gives the sensation like a beat is skipping, may experience palpitations or an anxiety sensation that your daughter explains like trembling. this extrasistoles may happen from different reasons from simple emotional stress to other pathologies like anemia, hyperthyroidism etc. so, my opinion as cardiologist is that you have nothing to worry. it is just a simple episode, and it is quite normal in younger ages. only if these symptoms persist and begins to interfere the daily live, if i was your treating doctor i will recommend some examinations like a blood analysis to exclude anemia, the thyroid hormones, an electrocardiogram, echocardiography and of course a holder monitoring. this will help us to document and see what happens with heart rhythm. at meantime, i will recommend your daughter to avoid coffee, caffeine products because they rise heart frequency and extrasistolic beats. i encourage her to have physical training because sometimes it helps in reducing extrasistoles, tachycardia, even making them disappear. wish i was helpful. take good care. best regards"

"hello , a have had a bony lump on my jaw below a tooth broken off at the surface for some time now . it didst hurt and would get larger and smaller . but overnight that size of my face has swollen . it does not hurt like accesses a have had in the past . a am wondering what is going on .",1,44715,"hello, i can understand your concern. it would have been helpful if you had mentioned which tooth was treated for root canal. as you are mentioning that the tooth was black and had cracks in it, i am assuming that the tooth is in the lower front region, and you had had some trauma to the lower jaw area which made the tooth dead and also hurt the chin and lip. other possibility is that if the tooth was dead for many years, it may have developed a periapical cyst in relation with the tooth which might be pressing on the mental nerve supplying lower lip and chin and may cause numbness of those areas. alternatively, the numbness may have started after taking local anesthesia in the lower front area for some tooth problem and the injection might have been given deep. in any case, it seems that the nerve supplying sensation to the lower front area of jaw along with lower lip and chin (mental nerve) is damaged. usually, if the nerve is damaged, it can regenerate in 3-6 months and the sensations can return. if you are not sure regarding the crown on the tooth, you can avoid it for some months and take care not to bite hard things with that tooth so that it does not fracture. you can get the crown after the numbness is solved. i would also advise you to visit an oral and maxillofacial surgeon for the examination of the area and regarding numbness. he/she might take an x-ray to rule out presence of periapical lesion or cyst in relation with the tooth. crown should surely be postponed until this possibility is ruled out. i hope this information helps you. thank you for choosing chat doctor. i wish you feel better soon. best,"

i i have been consulting doctors for the past 6 months ... i have left abdominal mild pain and is still continuing . by ultrasound report says mild dilatation of pelvicalyceal system and upper ureter and small calculus of 4 my is present in left kidney ... done know what to do ... ply help,1,34445,"hi, thanks for writing in. the collecting system of the kidney is made of renal calyxes and pelvis. this collects the urine formed in kidney and transports it through the ureter (tubes connecting kidneys and urinary bladder) to the urinary bladder. the pelvicalyceal system is the mouth of the kidney where it connects with the upper end of the ureter. i guess that you have got ultrasound scan done, and it shows mild fullness of the pelvicalyceal system in the left kidney, that is a term applied to increase in diameter of the collecting system in your left kidney. it is not a critical situation, and please do not worry if you do not have any urinary symptoms. since it is mentioned as mild fullness and no kidney stones have been found, therefore(i) it can be that your bladder was completely full at the of ultrasound scan(ii) your kidney pelvicalyceal system is appearing full by itself (extrarenal pelvis) and is an extension of normal appearance.(iii) rarely an infection of urinary system and kidneys (recent or old) can cause such a finding, but this is likely only if you have symptoms like pain in the region of kidney and problems like burning urination or discoloration of urine or any kidney infections in the past.(iv) stones in kidney or ureter can also cause fullness of pelvicalyceal system and since you do not have any stone therefore this does not apply to you. it is important to know if your scan was repeated after passing urine and still there was persistent mild fullness of the pelvicalyceal system on left side. this can also be confirmed by doing an mvp which is injecting a contrast and taking 5 to 6 x-rays to study the functioning of the kidneys in a better way. please consult the urologist."

a have been detected with gallstones with no infection of 15mm size ... my father is also doctor and he wants me to try udiliv for 2 months and then go for surgery ... where as castro surgeon told me to remove gallbladder as soon as possible ... a am not sure what to do,2,77921,"most people who have gallstones do not have symptoms. if you have symptoms, you most likely will have mild pain in the pit of your stomach or in the upper right part of your belly. pain may spread to your right upper back or shoulder blade area. sometimes the pain is more severe. it may be steady, or it may come and go. or it may get worse when you eat. you may decide to go to the doctor because of pain in your belly. in this case, your doctor will ask you questions about when the pain started, where it is, and if it comes and goes or is always there. your doctor may order imaging tests. these take pictures of the inside of your body. an ultrasound of the belly is the best test to find gallstones. this test does not hurt. your ultrasound may not show gallstones. but if your doctor still thinks you have a problem with your gallbladder, he or she may order a gallbladder scan. in this test, a doctor injects dye into a vein in your arm. then a machine takes x-rays as the dye moves through your liver, bile duct, gallbladder, and intestine. if you do not have symptoms, you probably do not need treatment. if your first gallstone attack causes mild pain, your doctor may tell you to take pain medicine and wait to see if the pain goes away. you may never have another attack. waiting to see what happens usually will not cause problems. if you have a bad attack, or if you have a second attack, you may want to have your gallbladder removed. a second attack means you are more likely to have future attacks. many people have their gallbladders removed, and the surgery usually goes well. doctors most often use laparoscopic surgery. for this, your surgeon will make small cuts in your belly and remove your gallbladder. you will probably be able to go back to work or your normal routine in a week or two, but it may take longer for some people. sometimes the surgeon will have to make a larger cut to remove the gallbladder. it will take longer for you to recover from this type of surgery. regards and take care"

"my child is 2 years old and she likes to eat dirt and rocks , what can i do ?",1,48320,"hi, thank you for the query. this pattern of eating or habit of eating dirt and rocks is medically termed as pica which is a disorder in which usually child chat doctor. it occurs due to loss of certain nutrients such as iron deficiency anemia, zinc deficiency. i suggest you to see your children pediatrician to rule out presence of any calcium deficiency which usually initiates the child to eat dirt or soil or rock. hope this information helps you. take care."
"my child is 2 years old and she likes to eat dirt and rocks , what can i do ?",2,48290,"hi, how old was she when she stopped eating? force-feeding is commonly used by parents when they believe the child is not eating enough. when a child has been ill or was prematurely born a parent may consider her fragile and force her to take more food than she wants. mothers can overestimate the quantity of food that a small child requires. the apparently small quantity which the child takes is enough for an average weight gain, but when mother does not realize this, she may try to force-feed her to eat more. most appetite problems begin between 6 and 18 months of age when the infant is developing independence and resists domination. i agree with the doctor who told you that all attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. no persuasion, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening and no punishment. she will eat when she wishes. place her in the high-chair and let her sit at the table with the rest of the family. the food is placed before her, and it is expected she will take what she wants. encourage holding and chat doctor. allow her to try placing food in her mouth by herself, and then help her if need be. if she does not touch her meal, she is left without any food until the next meal. if she doesn't touch the next meal, again she should be left without food. she will soon eat when hunger overtakes her as long as no one makes a fuss about what she eats. a small child can eat some meat, then the pudding and return to the meat. parent makes it clear that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it she can leave the table, but there will be nothing else. a child likes bright colors so make food attractive and of variety. as long as she has a poor appetite, give no more than a pint of milk a day. allow her to feed herself as much as possible. as soon as your infant realizes that she cannot make more fuss and attract any more attention the food refusal stops. she needs outdoor exercise and over-fatigue should be avoided. normal amount of sleep for her age is 12 to 13 hours a day. naps decrease from two to one at average age of 18 months. when parents carry out this treatment plan, the response is extremely satisfactory. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further."

"i , i am 27 years old and i have been experiencing lower right abdominal pain for about half a year . the pain is constant and it becomes worse after i have any form of bowel movement or bending movements . a did an ultrasound scan and nothing wrong was found with my reproductive organs . subsequently , i saw a colorectal specialist who initially thought that my constipation problem is causing the pain . however , after being on mild laxatives for 3 weeks , the pain did not improve of go away . the doctor says he is unsure of what is wrong with me . a have also sought help alternatively from traditional chinese medicine who has diagnosed me with chronic appendicitis . basically , he identified this condition by first pressing on the lower right quadrant of my abdomen ( where the pain is ) . after which , he lifted up my right leg and pressed on the same spot again and that set me off into a yelping pain in which i literally jumped up a little from the bed . hence , i will like to seek other opinions as to what can be causing this constant lower right abdominal pain . is it indeed a condition of chronic appendicitis ? this is bearing in mind that the pain intensifies after bowel movements or during any bending motions . thank you very much for your kind help and time .",1,34066,"thank you for the query. i would like to know your sons age, duration of the right sided lower abdominal pain and how frequently he experiences the pain (daily, weekly etc.). i would also inquire whether he is on any painkillers for this condition and whether there is any particular aggravating factor for the pain, like deep breathing or coughing. one common cause of right sided lower abdominal pain is acute appendicitis. this is usually accompanied by fever and vomiting. ingestion of painkillers may mask the intensity of the pain, which may be perceived as a dull, aching pain. usually appendicitis in its acute stage has a tender right lower abdomen. irregular bowel movement may lead to abdominal pain and discomfort, which may be vague and difficult to describe. simple abdominal muscle pull/cramp may lead to muscular pain. i would request you to visit your physician, who can carry out a thorough physical check-up and differentiate a deep pain from a superficial muscle pain. some investigations like usg abdomen may be required, if the pain doesn't subside. a stool examination may be performed. hope this helps you out"

"a am 70 years old , and for the last year one of my testicles has grown to about three times the size of my other testicle . should a be worried ? a am in good health , and had a double hernia operation via my abdomen about four years ago . your help will be appreciated .",1,54817,hellothanks for query. based on the facts that you have sustained testicular injury 8 years back and has bilateral spermatocyte and worried about diminished secretion of testosterone by the testis due to trauma and lowering your sperm count due to bilateral spermatocyte. testosterone secretion can not be reduced due to trauma to your testicle at the age of 12 years when the testicles are not fully developed which usually takes after the age of 15 -16 years as regards your doubt about the effect of spermatocyte to lower down the sperm count i would state that sperm are produced by seminiferous tubules in testicle whereas spermatocyte is a benign cyst located in epididymis that develops due to blockage in transmission of sperms from epididymis into va's and has no direct or indirect effect on spermatogenesis(sperm production). chat doctor.

is it safe to take flucloxacilin antibiotics when a actually in day 10 of my cycle and a am probably expecting my ovulation on day 14. doctor has given me the antibiotics for a week . a am very reluctant to take it now since a am really planning for my pregnancy ? kindly advice,1,95960,"hello, welcome to chat doctor. you have not mentioned since how long you have been trying for pregnancy because infertility is termed only if after 1 year of unprotected intercourse, you are not getting pregnant. for conception, try having intercourse every month around your ovulation days as it is the best time for conceiving. it usually occurs regularly, around day 14 of a 28-day menstrual cycle. the best timing of intercourse in order to conceive is day 10, 12, 14 and 16 (in case of late ovulation) of a 28-day cycle. you can use an ovulation predictor kit for detecting the ovulation time also. after intercourse, do not wash immediately and keep on lying for half an hour. if still you are unable to conceive, then the various medical causes need to be investigated. consult an infertility expert then. hope it helps. regards."
is it safe to take flucloxacilin antibiotics when a actually in day 10 of my cycle and a am probably expecting my ovulation on day 14. doctor has given me the antibiotics for a week . a am very reluctant to take it now since a am really planning for my pregnancy ? kindly advice,2,95735,"hallow dear, at the time of ovulation, little spotting for few hours is known. it is called as mittelschmerz. this is very little spotting for few hours. so after the spotting is over, there is no harm in having intercourse. bleeding on day 6 of the cycle cannot be mittelschmerz. it is just an extended menstrual bleeding. during menstrual bleeding, intercourse carries risk of infection since blood is a very good medium for the growth of pathogens. on this day intercourse is futile also since there is no egg present on this day. the fertile period is not around day 6 of the cycle. the egg is released 14 days prior to the next expected menses. the egg has life of 24 hours and the sperms are active for 72 hours. hence, a period of about a week around the day of egg release (ovulation) is considered as fertile period. those who are keen to have pregnancy should concentrate on this period for sexual relations. you are following further with bbt also to identify the day of ovulation. now you have more accurate methods available for locating the day of ovulation. ovulation kits available in the market are good for practical purpose. ultrasonography ovulation monitoring is a very good method. from day 9 of the cycle, daily ultrasonography informs about the development of follicle & endometrium and the event of egg release also. follicles which ovulate when they are between 18 mm to 21 mm size have best results of conception and continuation of pregnancy. for successful implantation of fertilized ovum, endometrium of 10 mm or more thickness is lucrative. considering the life of egg and sperms, you can definitely avoid the intercourse during mittelschmerz since it is a short phase of the day; and still have successful intercourse during or around the ovulation. i hope this helps you."

i am27 years old with a perfectly healthy life style . i have been married for the last 2.5 years we have not been able to conceive for the last one year . i have been diagnosed with mycobacterium tuberculosis of the uterus . what is this about and what are the chances of having a normal pregnancy after its cure .. is this 100 curable ? ?,1,10535,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. pregnacare conception is simply a combination of vitamins that help a woman have a healthy pregnancy from conception. it has no hormonal effects and should not have any impact on the regularity of your cycle nor your ability to conceive, it is not unusual for women to bleed on and off for even 6 weeks after a miscarriage so the 19-day bleeding episode you had may not have actually been a menstrual period but still could have been bleeding leftover for your d and c. so you may not be ""late"" at all, but may just have not had a real period since the pregnancy. there is no reason to assume you would have problems getting pregnant again since you have conceived naturally twice in the last year. either way, the pregnancies conception vitamins have nothing to do with your irregular bleeding. it is generally advisable to wait to try to conceive again after your first real period-so i would wait until you bleed again to resume trying to conceive. if you do not get a real period by 3 months from your last bleeding episode, you should follow up for your gun for a re-evaluation of your hormones and treatment with progesterone, which can restart your period cycling. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful. best wishes,"

"a am 18 years old and just a little over a week ago a had gotten my wisdom teeth removed . now a had no problems until now . when a eat ( or any kind of movement ) on the bottom right side , this gross smell/taste comes out of the gum area . now when that happened a tired to spit the puss out , but there was none . also the gum does not look swollen nor does it look infected . it does have a throbbing pain that is variable though . a have no idea what this could be .",1,86792,"dear sir/ mam, i understand your problem. always when a tooth erupts, the tissue surrounding it will get swollen and become a bit red. then the teeth tear the gums and comes out. the gum tissue above the tooth will be always very loose until the tootchatdoctores out completely into mouth. this loose gum tissue allows food accumulation under it and it's difficult to clean. this may cause infection and pain in the gum tissue. so already swollen gum tissue now become even worse. the opposite teeth will now bite on this tissue. so first treatment option is to cut the loose tissue above the erupting wisdom teeth. its very simple procedure of 2 minutes. if the problem recur, then take an x-ray and assess whether the wisdom tooth is in proper angulation to come out into the mouth. if the space in the jawbone is not enough and if the orientation of wisdom tooth is not good, it cannot come out. it may damage the adjacent teeth also in that condition. so better to take it off. you can normally chew even without wisdom teeth. so no need to worry. hope your query is answered. please don't hesitate to contact be back for further doubts."

by 10 or old boy has been having terrible episodes of whooshing in the ears and temple headaches on and off the last coupe of weeks.they last from 10 mind to half an hour . be are seeing the of tomorrow but he is so scared when it happens and wondered if you had any ideas .,1,90927,"hi, i am chat doctor. i have read your message. i think i can help you. first, the symptoms that you have described are highly suggestive of seizures. here is why- 1. they come in night-seizures are commonly triggered when the patient sleeps or just around the sleep. of course, they can occur at other times too.2. they start from the leg and move up and then spread to the rest of the body.3. the episodes last 3-4 minutes and then resolves. i assume (you have not mentioned it) that it is never remembered by him, the episode that is. i think you should both take it very seriously. there is a high possibility that there is an intracranial problem that he is having which is extending and progressing undetected in the brain just because you do not want to visit a neurologist. i think you should meet a neurologist as soon as possible and request an mri brain (with spectroscopy if needed) and video eeg. if he does turn out to have a pathology, treatment will have to be initiated for the pathology in addition to regular anti-epileptic medicines. i suggest taking a video of these episodes that he is having. it may help convince him that he needs to visit a doctor, and it may be helpful to the doctor in seeing the condition that your husband has. yes, you need to visit a neurologist as soon as possible. ideally, i would also like to know if he has been having headaches for the past years? does he seem to be having episodes where he does not recollect what he has been doing for a certain duration of time? you may need to talk to his colleagues at work and find out if he has been having seizures or any abnormal behavior at work. there is a high chance that he knows that he has been having seizures at work and not telling you about it. i have tried my best to help you. unfortunately, i cannot initiate / suggest medicines as long as the diagnosis is not confirmed because the anti-epileptics may have severe side effects. best of luck,"

i have left the pill ( admin ) going on the third week now . i had withdrawal bleeding lasting 3 days . this happened 3 days after i left the pill . this saturday i felt like urinating lot especially in the mornings and evenings . i need to pee but couldn't . i was spotting this monday . and today i have the same urination problem . my tummy is also bloated . i am trying to fall pregnant . i have a test last week and it was negative . what could this be ?,1,81216,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. bleeding when you are not supposed to have your period is called breakthrough bleeding and is common when you start taking birth control pills until your system is used to it. the bleeding usually stops by the third month back on the pill. taking the pill close to the same time every day will help to minimize the bleeding. it is unusual to have a polyp on your ovary. many people have cysts on their ovaries, so it is more likely to be a cyst if you had ovarian surgery in the past. either way, a cyst on your ovary would not cause vaginal bleeding. the bleeding itself is not dangerous or harmful, but it is likely just a side effect of the pill. if the bleeding continues after two more menstrual cycles, you may want to talk to your healthcare provider about trying a different brand of birth control. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful. best wishes,"

( were 15 years old ) 2 ) does this sound like it could be something serious ( the voices and things ) .",1,15522,"hello, welcome to chat doctor. thanks for posting your question at this forum. we understand your concern. i am chat doctor psychiatry from india. i will guide you about your daughters' health. whatever information you have given here about your daughter, point towards a serious long-lasting mental illness of psychosis like schizophrenia. i must explain you in simpler way. schizophrenia is a psychotic illness in which the person has abnormal perception, absurd thinking, decline of higher mental function, deterioration in social and occupational functioning and significant personal sufferings for years. the patient may claim to hear unusual voices which others deny hearing. this is called auditory hallucination. initially the voices come for a short period and the person feels strange and does not understand what to do. he/ she gradually may start believing on those voices as frequency and intensity of voices increases with passage of time. often these voices comment/discuss derogatory about the person and sometimes these may suggest or command the person to do certain act. sometimes the person may harm herself/ himself sunder the influence of these voices. as you have experienced, she has a self-talking behavior since last many years, has harmed herself once and now she is claiming a clear two-way conversation with that voice. it appears that she is having auditory hallucination(auditory hallucination is one of the commonest symptoms in psychosis like schizophrenia), and apparently these voices are unpleasant or commanding in nature that might have provoked the episode of self harm in the past. since the onset of symptoms is in childhood and has been continuing for years it shows poor awareness of caregiver about the symptoms of illness. it is never too late. you must consult a good child and adolescent psychiatrist and encourage your daughter to discuss her symptoms honestly so that the diagnosis can be finalized. if i had been her doctor, i would have advice her for brain imaging, certain other investigations, to take some antipsychotic medicines under supervision of a family member and to attend psycho-educative classes regularly. medicines and supportive therapy can bring remission to illness. hope this has helped you. i wish you all the best."

( ruined two pairs of shoes ) two doctors have tried and failed at diagnosing , and a suspect a parasitic infection . a want to show you a picture. ( ? )",1,44716,"hello vivek, thank you for posting your question. the clinical diagnosis of any fever is based on a few principles. firmly we inquire about the associated symptoms the child had with fever. apart from that the extent and pattern of fever, whether it was associated with chills or came at any particular time of the day etc. these details would help us know what would probably have caused the fever and based on that investigations are usually ordered. in case of atv, as you informed he was initially treated for a stomach infection, then for pneumonia and finally for urinary tract infection. in such a situation you have two possibilities. either he had 3 different kinds of infection which presented with fever over 2 months, in which case his fever should have subsided each time with the medication, he should have felt better and then again fallen sick with a new infection. if that is not the case then his fever could probably be attributed to a single cause, with the other two being misdiagnoses. in such cases investigations could give support and clue as to what the exact cause of fever is. mucosal irregularities in urinary bladder is a very non-specific finding and the diagnosis of a urinary tract infection should never solely be based on that. associated symptoms of pain or difficulty in urination along with a positive urine culture is required for diagnosis. if you could provide any more information regarding what his urine culture report was, or what his associated symptoms were, then it would be much easier for me to provide you any further guidance."

i a a into my 3rd trimester of my 2nd pregnancy .... a have marginal placenta previn and have started noticing some cramping in the abdominal area plus a brownish-clear mucus in the toilet and in my underwear . should a be going to the hospital or ... am a worrying too soon ? please respond . thank you . - sammy,1,107272,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. hormonal changes during pregnancy normally causes fluctuations in the consistency, amount, color, and odor of vaginal discharge. furthermore, during the second trimester pregnancy, due to changes in your cervix, more mucus secretion is normal. this may produce the yellowish tint that you have been noticing. as long as your discharge does not have a strong fishy odor, and does not itch, likely physiologically normal and requires no further diagnosis or treatment. if you ever notice any discharge that is tinged with blood, or that is accompanied by lower abdominal cramping or is more the consistency of water, you should mention this to your prenatal care provider or be evaluated as these can be indications of other problems. but in summary, the symptoms that you describe are completely normal and are not harmful to the pregnancy. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"
i a a into my 3rd trimester of my 2nd pregnancy .... a have marginal placenta previn and have started noticing some cramping in the abdominal area plus a brownish-clear mucus in the toilet and in my underwear . should a be going to the hospital or ... am a worrying too soon ? please respond . thank you . - sammy,2,52955,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. in the first trimester of pregnancy, your ovaries produce the hormone progesterone which normally is made by the placenta once it reaches adequate size. so it is not unusual in the first trimester pregnancy to feel pain in your ovaries. in addition, as your uterus stretches, you also may experience some cramping and pulling sensations, which can be on the sides. the only thing that is concerning is if you have not had an ultrasound this pregnancy to confirm that it is normal and located in your uterus. if you already have had an ultrasound for this pregnancy it is unlikely that there could be anything harmful going on, especially if you are not bleeding. so if the pain is severe enough that you cannot function, especially if you have not yet had an ultrasound, if you cannot reach her doctor within a reasonable amount of time, you may want to pursue care in an emergency setting. if you have had a normal ultrasound earlier in this pregnancy, you really do not need to worry, as your ovaries are normally examined as part of your pregnancy ultrasound and a large cyst would've already been detected. tylenol, or acetaminophen is safe to use for pain at the normal adult dosage during all trimesters of pregnancy, and you can try to see if that helps with the pain. i hope that i was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,"

"lately , a have been getting very sick the next day after only a few drinks 2-4 over a span of 3-4 hours . pick to the point where my head pounds , i vomit frequently , nothing stays down ( water , bread ) and only start to feel better in the evening ( 6-7pm ) a have plenty of food in stomach though . also , had half a beer tonight and felt sick instantly , now my liver is aching .",1,33341,"hi, if you came to my clinic with those complaints i would ask you to stop worrying. many women that start using the pills for the first time experience similar problems. i understand that you have taken the inactive pills first and then started on the active pills. also, you have had intercourse only after your period was over that is about 11 days ago. the chances of pregnancy occurring after a single act of unprotected sexual intercourse are only 4%. also, for women that have regular periods the chance of getting pregnant is more if intercourse occurs after 11-12 days since the first day of the period. hence, the chances of getting pregnant are low if you have had contact before this period. you are also having a sick feeling in the stomach and most probably a cramp like feeling. this may be due to the pills as some females take time to get adjusted and may improve with continuous use and by taking the pills with food. the pills are not known to cause any major effect on the baby if they are inadvertently taken in early pregnancy. since you have started taking the active pills late, i would recommend that you use a backup contraceptive measure like condoms, for the next 7 days while you still take the pills to avoid pregnancy. i would be pleased to answer any further queries that you may have, enjoy a wonderful day."

"i a a 31 years old and a had an ectopic pregnancy when a was 20 . additionally a have tilted uterus , can a still conceive ?",3,73581,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. pregnancy symptoms widely between women, and it is true that symptoms of ectopic pregnancy can include spotting and pain on one side. however, the key point is that these symptoms of ectopic pregnancy are only relevant along with a positive pregnancy test. if your pregnancy test is negative, then you do not have an ectopic pregnancy. you had mentioned that your cycles are normally very irregular, so it is certainly not unusual to have irregular hormonal symptoms as well when your period is late. the stress of worrying about pregnancy can even delay your cycle further, so i hope that you find this information to be reassuring. i hope i was able to answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

hello .. a have been having cramps in by abdomen for about 4 days the pain comes and goes it seems like it a trading in the abdomen region . a a burping and passing gas . a a now taking robotics but its only the first day . when a breathe the pain does to increase and there is no blood in my stool .,1,30579,"hi ! your flu and the diarrhea with abdominal cramps may or may not be related. in case of child chat doctor. the first diagnosis comes to the mind is a food poisoning. possibly you did not receive proper complete treatment for it and this led to more severe cramps in your abdomen. you did not mention anything about fever. if it was there, then it goes more in favor of infection in the intestines. there is no harm in taking antacid and antiflatulents, but i am not in favor of your taking enema. after any loose motions, it is but natural that the bowel becomes empty, and it takes time for the bowel to get loaded with fecal matter to get the urge of passing stool again. also, without knowing the exact cause of the cramps in your abdomen which could be any surgical cause like diverticulitis, one should not opt for an anemia. it is difficult to tell whether the swelling on the left side of your lower abdomen is due simple inflammation with mass formation or a leaking diverticulitis precipitated by self enema by yourself. in my opinion, you should consult at your earliest a general surgeon, who may advise some routine investigations for you apart from going for an ultrasound / ct scan depending on the initial examination findings. one more possibility of the swelling is left sided inguinal hernia, but your history does not go much in favor of it. anyways i think it is time for you to see your general surgeon and seek his advice. good luck."

"pm a 46 year old man , had a terrible toothache after filling.had the tooth extracted and prescribed clavam 625 my and metal 500 . two days into taking these had diarrhoea , what really causes this and also have tight stomach muscles and feel ridged on my waist.im also not having an erection .",1,110385,"hello and thank you for your question. what you had pop out was either the blood clot that had formed when you had the tooth extracted or old food debris. this is the same way the other parts of your body shed a scab. this one happened to be in your mouth. you are experiencing the sensitivity and throbbing because now you have raw tissue exposed to the outside environment. this is a normal part of healing. i would suggest rinsing your mouth out with warm salt water to help keeping the area clean and reduce the swelling. 10oz warm water, 1/2 tsp salt swish and spit 4-6 times a day especially after eating. also, you can take nsaids such as ibuprofen, at this point i would take 600 mg every 6 hours as needed for pain. if the pain continues or gets worse, go into your dentist to be evaluated for infection formation. best wishes and good health"

"a started getting chest pain yesterday , pretty much under my left breast . it felt as though there were cylinder blocks squeezing down on my chest . it lasted about 15 mind , then the pain decreased from an 8 to about a 4-5 on and off accompanied with sob and tiredness and pounding and irregular heartbeat . a chewed an aspirin and also swallowed one . a then realized that laying down on my back and even more so on my right side made the pain on the left more severe . a am somewhat hesitant to go to the hospital and just praying the pain will subside . but my only relief seems to be sitting up and resting while doing so . please advise ..",1,44855,"greetings. welcome to chat doctor, and thank you for your question. i understand your concern. your age would help me a lot in constructing a differential diagnosis. however, i will explain some forms of chest pain, which we aim to exclude first, as the main and most dangerous organic causes of it. first, there is angina. angina is a moderate-to-severe chest pain, more characterized like a heaviness or tenderness or ""squeezing"" feeling, localized in the mid-chest, and then radiates to the both sides of the chest, the jaw, left shoulder and left arm. this is the pain originated from one or more blockages within the coronary arteries (arteries that supply the heart muscle with oxygen and nutrients). if this is your case, you should perform an ekg and an echocardiogram, and, depending on these two tests, a cardiac stress test. second, there is sharp, stabbing pain. this kind of pain can come from an enlargement of the root of the aorta and/or from aortic aneurysm. it is severe in intensity, and radiates to the back, between the wings. also, it can be caused by an acute or chronic inflammation to the linings within the rib cage, i.e. the pleura (lining of the lungs) and pericardium (the lining of the heart). this kind of pain - pleuritic pain - is less severe than that caused by aortic aneurysm, and relieves or aggravates from switching positions or the respiratory cycle. if this is the case, then echocardiogram (for pericardium and root of the aorta), chest x-ray (for the pleura and the lungs), and computed tomography of the aorta (in case we suspect that there is a problem with the aorta, higher than its root), should be performed. there is always a possibility of intercostal (between ribs) muscle or pectoral (chest) muscle soreness, and pain originated from problems with ribs and rib joints. if this is the case, you can use over the counter painkillers. i hope i was thorough with my answer. best regards."

hi i went to my up and he did a test and it came back at 49 so he did one more and it came back at 39 and he said that of but i feel that it is not he is going to test me again in 8 weeks is there ant thing i can say or do thanks a a robinson sorry that my esr a,1,58987,"his am chat doctor. i have read your message. i think i can help you. first, a package test means that multiple tests are included that correlate to the test. cpk and spe can both be package tests as there are many related tests needed in a diagnosis. the symptoms that you seem to be facing as per the query is basically severe backache that increases on lying down or bending-in other words, anything that causes the spine to be under pressure. now she itself can cause the symptoms. the muscles and bone problems can arise in she itself and thus possibly one will feel that there is nothing more to do. however, in many situations, the doctors may get biased my a diagnosis. so, i think it is good that your doctor did not get biased with your pre-existing diagnosis of she and continued to look for other causes of backache. a severe backache can happen due to muscle disorders, a condition known as myopathy. the cause of myopathy may be she itself. the test commonly done to test myopathy is cpk or creatine phospholipase. this is a test done from blood. the idea is if the cpk is raised, it suggests myopathy. in this situation, your doctor will need to modify the therapy. i am unaware of your medication from the query. so i cannot really comment upon it. but some medicines themselves cause myopathy. and sometimes, the dose of existing medicines need to be stepped up for treatment of myopathy. so i presume your doctor wanted to check that. second test was spe or serum protein electrophoresis. this is one of the tests for multiple myeloma. this is a type of malignancy that affects the bones and causes bone pains and should be ruled out in middle-aged to elderly commonly if the backache is worsening and is specially bad when lying down. if the test is negative, there is nothing to worry about. if it does come out to be positive, multiple myeloma can be treated. so again you need not worry since the treatment is available. why the doctor did not tell you about the tests is something i can only speculate about. i guess it was because these are just doubts, considering you already have she- in medicine, the usual dictum is that one disease can explain the symptom, the other condition should not be sought. having said that, it's a folly to miss another diagnosis due to a pre-existing condition. i think he would have told you if the tests came out positive. so there should be nothing to worry about-the doctor was just making sure that there is no other problem. possibly since there was nothing else diagnosed, he did not tell you about it. i have tried to make it as simple as possible to understand the situation. in case there are still doubts, feel free to contact me for further details. best of luck,"

hello.my age is 21 years and i a a student by profession.i done sit continuously for more than 3 hours still i have a backache from past 1 month.it is maximum when i wake up in the morning and gradually goes down during the day and then suddenly comes back.it keeps coming and going .. what might be the possible reasons for it and what is its cure ?,1,24397,"there are quite a long list of other therapies for the pain. the operation issue intrigues me because the shoulder and the back are not connected. and the shoulder if it is the part down below the neck is inside the chest and doesn't get much wear and tear. if it is at the neck, then neck disk disease is very, very common and almost always shows up on regular x-rays. but. has nothing to do with back and legs in the vast majority. back to pain management: there are multiple levels. obviously the first level is what is broken and fixing it with the surgery. the second level is the pain produced from the problem. nerve pills sometimes work. muscle relaxants sometimes work. amitriptyline is both a nerve pill (like lidocaine) and a blocker of pain signals at the spine. the third level is the context in which the pain is held. while lately everyone is talking about mindfulness and yoga, frankly you might as well try a fidget spinner. i am highly dubious about all of them. but, having the pain be directed by oneself and having it decrease is known to be among the most effective modulators of pain. so, if you can do exercise or physical therapy in the context of making it painful, then the pain experience is less after creating the pain and with repeating it the pain goes down (except during the physical therapy where it goes up for the first 2 months then stabilizes but is still painful)."

(as you said he has difficulty in walking now). you can also say to his parents that --- they can continue with all religious customs along with medicines, may be then they will agree... with medicine, he will start showing improvement in few days only... it is psychosis and patients will not agree to go to any doctor willingly, so you might need to take him forcefully. this is well accepted as it is for his benefit only. even if he doesn't agree for oral medicine there are injectables which are given to such patients... take the right step, take him to a doctor. hope the reply is useful feel free to ask more questions"

a don to know if you can help me it has to do with my birthcontrol a had been off my birthcontrol for about two to three days then a was intimate with my boyfriend two days later a got my period is it possible that a could be pregnant from doing that,2,108096,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. it is true that theoretically you should have been clear of the injection within three months of discontinuation, however many women after being a depo-provera for a long time do not resume having ovulatory, regular, menstrual cycles until 6 to 9 months or even up to a year after discontinuation. unfortunately, it is difficult to artificially induce ovulation in women who are coming off depo-provera. if you were not trying to become pregnant, your cycle could be regulated temporarily with birth control pills, but if you're actually trying to get pregnant the best thing you can do with this point is to just keep trying and wait and see. if you feel any symptoms of pregnancy, and you haven't gotten your period for a while, i would do pregnancy test just to make sure. there is always a possibility even if your periods are not regular that you do ovulate sometimes. so in summary, continue having unprotected sex every other to every three days and give it some more time. 80% of couples will conceive within one year, and if after a year of trying you and your partner are unsuccessful, it might be a good idea to see a fertility specialist for an evaluation. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question, and that my advice was helpful. best wishes, and good luck getting pregnant,"

"hi , my name is eberechi age i was diagnosed with high prolactin level of 34. i started taking parlodel from april till september and two months on closed october and november and at the end of each cycle i am given progesterone for 3days . after i was put parlodei in december and still no pregnancy has been achieved",1,49266,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. if you last had your period on september 12th, and today is october 5th, your period is not yet late for october. most women have a 25-35 day cycle, so until you actually miss your period for october, there is no reason to assume you are pregnant. the folic acid and zinc you are taking are just extra vitamins that provide health to a growing pregnancy; these should not affect or change your menstrual cycle or its symptoms. if your period is late in october, you should purchase and perform an over-the-counter pregnancy test. modern pregnancy tests are very accurate and can be positive even 10 days after conception. if you do find out you are pregnant, there is nothing that needs to be done immediately as pregnancy is not a disease- it is a normal state for women in the reproductive phase of their lives. so it is important only to keep taking your vitamins, get plenty of rest, eat a balanced diet and avoid alcohol, caffeine and chat doctor. if your period is mate, but you are not pregnant, the delay in your cycle can have a number of causes, including hormonal imbalances, certain medical conditions like thyroid disease, and even the stress of worrying about pregnancy. if you miss more than 2 months of your cycle (no bleeding for 3 months) and your pregnancy test is negative, you should see a physician for a hormonal evaluation. so in summary, a late menstrual cycle can be caused by pregnancy, but there are other causes as well. i suggest you perform a pregnancy test if you are late, and if it is negative, try to be patient, and you will likely get it before another month goes by. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

a have pain in my left foot when walking . it varies in intensity . a also have clicking when walking . a exercise 3 times a week . the pain is on the left side of the foot is only painful when a walk . the pain is a sharp sometimes . a broke a bone in my heal 6 years ago .,1,48791,"hi, thank you for providing the brief history of you. a thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised. as your chief complaint is that when you walk there is a sharp pain in the lateral side of the left foot, i suspect it to be muscular pain or either neuropathic pain for which a thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised. also. when there is a nerve impingement in the lumbar spine, it all starts with the pain in most cases on the lateral side of the foot. as you even mentioned that you had a bony injury in the past, there might be a tendency of abnormal gait during that time and shortening of muscles of the spine due to walking in pain. as i feel, by strengthening the muscles of the core, spine, pelvic floor and lower limbs on both sides you should be able to walk. since the nerve impingement gives the initial symptoms as pain in the lateral side of the foot and progresses over a period of time. so before it gets more on future you can get an mri of lumbar spine and them proceed with physical therapy for the lumbar spine. in my clinical experience i see cases who initially comes with this sort of pain and later with nerve impingement diagnosis. so, from past couple of years i have noticed that this is the first alerting symptom of the neurological pain, so now i deal with first an mri of spine and core stability. results come on 3-4 weeks of time and post which in future complaints are less regards jay in chat doctor."

(as you said he has difficulty in walking now). you can also say to his parents that --- they can continue with all religious customs along with medicines, may be then they will agree... with medicine, he will start showing improvement in few days only... it is psychosis and patients will not agree to go to any doctor willingly, so you might need to take him forcefully. this is well accepted as it is for his benefit only. even if he doesn't agree for oral medicine there are injectables which are given to such patients... take the right step, take him to a doctor. hope the reply is useful feel free to ask more questions"

"i .. 2 years ago i had gallbladder surgery , and here lately i been having that feel exactly like a gallbladder attack , except worse , i vomit and have diarreaha so bad that i just cant eat anything , my belly button leaks out green and brown discharge sometimes bleeds and its bright red on the inside of it .",1,77921,"most people who have gallstones do not have symptoms. if you have symptoms, you most likely will have mild pain in the pit of your stomach or in the upper right part of your belly. pain may spread to your right upper back or shoulder blade area. sometimes the pain is more severe. it may be steady, or it may come and go. or it may get worse when you eat. you may decide to go to the doctor because of pain in your belly. in this case, your doctor will ask you questions about when the pain started, where it is, and if it comes and goes or is always there. your doctor may order imaging tests. these take pictures of the inside of your body. an ultrasound of the belly is the best test to find gallstones. this test does not hurt. your ultrasound may not show gallstones. but if your doctor still thinks you have a problem with your gallbladder, he or she may order a gallbladder scan. in this test, a doctor injects dye into a vein in your arm. then a machine takes x-rays as the dye moves through your liver, bile duct, gallbladder, and intestine. if you do not have symptoms, you probably do not need treatment. if your first gallstone attack causes mild pain, your doctor may tell you to take pain medicine and wait to see if the pain goes away. you may never have another attack. waiting to see what happens usually will not cause problems. if you have a bad attack, or if you have a second attack, you may want to have your gallbladder removed. a second attack means you are more likely to have future attacks. many people have their gallbladders removed, and the surgery usually goes well. doctors most often use laparoscopic surgery. for this, your surgeon will make small cuts in your belly and remove your gallbladder. you will probably be able to go back to work or your normal routine in a week or two, but it may take longer for some people. sometimes the surgeon will have to make a larger cut to remove the gallbladder. it will take longer for you to recover from this type of surgery. regards and take care"

"in 37 and trying to get pregnant , how can i boost my chances ? i was told by a friend that taking a hot bath relaxes you and can help , i did have the implant taken out justb4 christmas and have now having regular periods i am a smoker but have cut down lot",1,15745,"hello, and i hope i can help you today. first, if you are late for your shot and have had unprotected sex, even if you are bleeding, you should do a urine pregnancy test. if your pregnancy test is negative, many women do not have regular periods come back after discontinuing the depo-provera injection for even up to 6 months. this, however, does not mean that you cannot become pregnant. if you are not actively trying to get pregnant, a good way to help regulate your cycles until your own body resumes a regular cycle is by taking birth control pills. birth control pills make you get a light, regular, predictable cycle every month and will help control breakthrough bleeding (the brown staining you have all the time). many women have irregular bleeding in the first 6 months to a year of using the shot, and unfortunately the same thing can happen after you discontinue it. so, in summary, all the irregular bleeding you are having is likely due to your discontinuing the demo shot. if you need contraception, the monthly cycle birth control pill would be a good option that can also help you have regular cycles. i hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. best wishes,"

a have had e-coli which has nearly gone but a now have a bloated stomach and pain at the top of my stomach after a eat . a have just had a breath test whicchatdoctore up negative . would the e-coli have damaged by stomach lining and that is causing the pain ?,1,97433,"hi, after reviewing your question i assume you mean a positive breath test for h. pylori? i am sorry to hear the amount of discomfort that you've been through. this is how i would proceed to look at your case:1. your symptoms are very peculiar for peptic ulcer disease or gastritis. both are different ways of getting damage done to your stomach. an ulcer is like a crater which may or may not be prone to bleeding. gastritis is a bit like having multiple pinpoint sore spots, causing pain and discomfort. a positive breath test may mean that you have h. pylori infection. as uncomfortable as this is, it is usually very treatable. were you on many painkillers because of the spinal fusion? if yes, then they would certainly have contributed. 2. i don't think a mask has anything to do with this. a sterile nasogastric tube taken out of the bag is very unlikely to bring infection to the insides of the stomach. nasogastric tubes, however, do cause a bit of irritation in the stomach lining. while they could have a very small contribution, i doubt they have had a significant effect. 3. the problem at hand seems to be the h. pylori infection which is a bacterial infection of the stomach lining which causes wear and tear in the stomach. this bug is acquired by the orofacial route. what this means is that someone with h. pylori sheds the bacteria through their stools. sometimes, because of poor hand hygiene, they may pass it on to others, especially through food. the new victim ingests these bugs and in this way h. pylori finds a new home to infest. i don't think your husband having a breath test will add to anything if he does not have symptoms. 4. an unintentional weight loss may signify a gastric ulcer (in opposition to peptic ulcer)5. you may benefit from a look down into the stomach through gastrostomy. it will give a great deal of information. your weight loss is also an indication of getting you a ct scan of the abdomen to ensure that there is nothing dangerous in play. 6. treatment would include amoxicillin, azithromycin and an acid tablet such as omeprazole for a 10 to 14-day course. since these recommendations include a gastrostomy, you will eventually have to visit a physician or a gastroenterologist to have it done. gastroenterologists are also excellent at managing h. pylori infections, along with ulcers and gastritis."

"a am a 31 year old female . for the past 2 years , a have experienced stroke like symptoms , numbness on one side of my body from my arm down to my leg , slurred speech , difficulty talking , thinking , and understanding words . a had problems moving my arms and walking . a literally had to think and figure out how to do simple tasks such as chewing and moving my limbs . a went to the of and mri and of scans were normal . a did not have a stroke or tia . another time a went to the of they admitted me and did a mri with contrast and that showed normal as well . a went to a euro and they prescribed vitamin d. a went to a cardio and heart looks normal . a also have frequent migraines and have high blood pressure . a just experienced another episode ( my 6th one ) a few weeks ago . that could this be ?",1,104553,"hi, as you mentioned the symptoms it looks like the patient had an early stroke. during the brain stroke every single minute is important. stroke can be assessed by experiencing the slurred speech, slowing of motor functions, unable to respond to commands. the first thing need is to get admit to a nearby hospital with a ct or an mri facility. if the brain stroke is on the left side on the ct or mri scan than the symptoms will be on the opposite side due to the pyramidal tracts of the nervous system. the design of the human body and its control system by nature is made such that left side of the brain support the right side of the body. once stroke comes rushing into and emergency room is always advised. within 3 hours of the first symptom noticed is of priority and importance. any delay in every minute will damage the brain more. as the blood supply to the brain is restricted by the clot and the damage to the neural tissues keeps continuing. so as soon as one notices the symptoms the earliest you should reach to the emergency room and start the treatment. well, what could have lead to stroke will be the high blood pressure findings are in common. ecg can be normal can be abnormal. ecg is done to rule out certain factors and focus the whole treatment plan on the brain stroke. that is the reason the ecg is always taken. brain stoke can be confined by symptoms and later my mri or a ct scan. post stroke if the physical disability is found then a physical therapist is taken into consideration along with the medication prescribed by the neurologist and the cardiologist. if patient has diabetes than a planetologist should be contacted for the medical part. i hope i have answered your query. if any you have in particular to ask or didn't understand i will surely help you in it."

"to ave been diagnosed with musculoskeletal chest pain , and ave told my doctor a experienced a bit of trouble breathing but there are days where a can breathe normally after a bit of exercise . a was also wondering if that could be the reason for my heart feeling as if it were beating faster , for example a went bowling yesterday and my heart would feel like it was beating faster and a would have to rest after a few games of bowling . this usually doesn't happen ( faster tartrate from doing small activities ) to me . a was wondering if this would go away soon enough or if there are any treatments , a was told to use a heating pad and a guess that helps a bit . thanks !",1,6921,"hello and thank you for using chat doctor. i carefully read you question, and i understand your concern. i will try to explain you something. there are different reasons that might cause increased or faster heart beats. the faster heart beats have to do with rhythm issues. if the beats are fast and regular it might be just a simple sinus tachycardia meaning that your heart rhythm is ok but just beating over 100 for minute. if the rhythm is chaotic it might be a different arrhythmia like atrial fibrillation. the cause of this rhythm issues might be different. physical or emotional stress, caffeine products might cause increased heart frequency so it's mandatory to avoid them. all sow, there are different pathologies like anemia, thyroid gland problems like hyperthyroidism that might be the cause of fast heart beats. in very rare cases the usage of stains for high cholesterol might give rhythm problems, but i'm not sure if this is your case. it might be just an episode related to a stressed day, or it might happen again. if it happens again, if i was your treating doctor i will recommend some simple examinations. i will recommend an electrocardiogram, a cardiac echocardiography and of course a rhythm holder monitoring for 24 h. this is necessary to have a full view of your mean frequencies during day and night. after these, a full blood check up to exclude anemia or thyroid problems. doing these examinations helps us understand if it is necessary to treat this high frequencies or not. hope i was helpful. wish you good health. best regards."

"a had a temporary crown placed on monday ( lower back molar ) a developed a blister on the gum behind the tooth 2 days later . the blister is now higher than the tooth . white , no pus . home swelling . not a lot of pain . would it be from an injection site or should a be concerned about an abscess ?",1,53390,hi. can understand your concern. as per your complaint the swollen gum and the white material inside it is a result of some inflammation. there can be a few reasons depending upon whether it is the second molar or the wisdom tooth. in case it is a wisdom tooth which is erupting or is impacted then the gum above it can get infected and inflamed due to either food deposition between the gum and the wisdom tooth or it can be due to gum flap bitten by the opposite jaw tooth and the condition is known as peritonitis. the white material in it is pus. in case it is second molar the swollen gum with white material in it can be as a result of infection in the gums due to deposits on the teeth like plaque or calculus or due to foreign body impaction in the gums which carries infection along with it deeper into the gums causing pus formation. it can also be due to deeply infected tooth causing pus formation below the tips of the roots of the tooth causing swelling on the gums with pus inside. i would suggest you to consult a dentist and get evaluated for the exact cause of the swelling and get treated accordingly. in case if it is wisdom tooth either excision of gum flap or extraction if the tooth is impacted followed by antibiotics and painkillers can be done. in case of gum infection professional cleaning of teeth followed by antibiotics and gum paints can help. in case of tooth infection root canal treatment or extraction depending on the condition of the tooth can be done. hope your query is solved. if you find the answer helpful please write a positive review and click on find this answer helpful as a token of appreciation. thanks and regards. chat doctor.
